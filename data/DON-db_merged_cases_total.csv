Additional hantaviruses that also cause human disease may be in circulation in the area. The viruses which cause HFRS are maintained in nature by field rodents, and infections of humans is thought to occur when people come into contact with infectious rodent excrete, often by aerosol route. War conditions favour transmission of hantaviruses since soldiers and displaced persons are forced to live in conditions conducive to increased contact with field rodents, thereby increasing their risk of infection.

"(' 21 March 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported The UK has analyzed cases of CJD that have occurred in 10 adults below 42 years of age during the past year. The disease in these cases differs from classical CJD in several respects: * early age (CJD is usually a disease of older people) * differences in pathological changes in the brain * absence of any hereditary factors (which are involved in typical CJD) There is no direct evidence of a link between these cases and bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE). However, in the absence of any apparent cause, the most likely explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before control measures were instituted in the UK in 1989. The measures now in force in the UK are considered to have minimized any possible risk from eating beef. No similar pattern of disease has been recognized in humans in any other country although BSE has also occurred in animals in Ireland, France, Portugal, and Switzerland. Precautions have been taken in these countries to avoid any possible risk to people from beef consumption.

While monkeys suffer a severe disease often leading to death, the limited information available indicates that humans may not become clinically ill. However, this is based only on the isolation of Reston virus from one asymptomatically infected animal handler identified during the original outbreak and a few seroconversions that were not associated with clinical disease. A formal quarantine procedure for imported monkeys was developed following the original Reston episode and it is this system that apparently identified the current cases. ',)",0

"(' 30 April 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported Introduction: last 17 April 1996, a local newspaper reported 2 monkeys from the Philippines died from Ebola infection in Hazleton, Alice, Texas, USA. The monkeys were found positive for Ebola-virus Reston strain. Although the Ebola virus-Reston strain has not been found to cause illness among humans, the Department of Health in collaboration with DENR/PAWB and the Department of Agriculture/BAI started investigation on April 18 1996 to determine the health-related effects to humans and monkeys exposed to the virus. A multi-agency committee was formed to conduct an investigation. The members of the committee are: 1) the Department of Health (Field Epidemiology Training Programme, Research Institute of Tropical Medicine and the Bureau of Research Laboratories), 2) Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau) and 3) Department of Agriculture (Bureau of Animal Industry). Methodology: An FETP team visited and interviewed personnel of Ferlite Scientific Research Inc. Using a standard symptom survey questionnaire. The signs and symptoms of Ebola infection include: High grade fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, cough jaundice, lymphadenopathy, CNS disturbances, and hemorrhagic tendencies like maculopapular rash, petechiae, nose and gum bleeding, hematemesis, hemoptysis, and black stools. Visual inspection of the monkey farm was also conducted. Results: There were 20 employees at the monkey farm. Eighteen were interviewed. All were males. Eleven (61%) were caretakers, 4 (22%) were veterinarians, 2 (11%) were carpenters, and 1 (5%) housekeeper. Twelve (67%) had history of injuries (bites and scratches). All were negative for any of the listed signs and symptoms related to Ebola infection. Two employees found to be positive for Ebola antibody in the 1993 one in the 1990 studies are still working in the farm. The ferlite Scientific Research, Inc. Monkey farm is situated in a 2.5 to 3-hectare area in Calamba, Laguna, about 40km. South of Manila. They have open cages as their holding facilities. The quarantine facility consists of individual cages. in 1995 they exported monkeys to the USA and Europe (Sweden). In 1996, they exported 100 monkeys to Hazleton, Alice, Texas, USA. A second batch of 100 monkeys to be exported to the same facility is still in their quarantine facility. Current monkey population is 1600.

The vaccination campaign has been extended to other affected regions. So far, 708 183 persons in the District of Bamako, 74 411 in the region of Mopti and 83 309 in the region of Koulikoro have been vaccinated. Analysis of the epidemiological situation indicate that the outbreaks have spread to other regions, in particular Ségou, Mopti and Sikasso. Mali is situated within the meningitis belt in Africa and has experienced outbreaks with regular intervals in the past, such as in 1969, 1981 and 1989. However, the epidemic intervals appear to have shortened as indicated by the epidemic in 1994 preceding this current epidemic.

In the strengthened surveillance system, each local health centre provides weekly reports to peripheral health centres for forwarding on to the regional and central health authorities. Most district health centres have radio communication links with the peripheral health services. Since 15 March 1996 the national health authorities have allocated 200 million CFA for vaccine and field operations and have ordered 1 million doses of vaccine and other material needed for the campaign. In addition, international agencies such as WHO, UNICEF, MSF, Fondation pour l'Enfance have contributed about 700 000 doses.

"(' 28 November 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported Summary: From 15 to 21 November 1996 an estimated 500 000 refugees returned from East Zaire to Rwanda across the border at Gisenyi, a small Rwandese town next to the Zairian town of Goma. More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success. The first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the Petite Barrière camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals. ""Way stations"" were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided. Two transit centres were opened for further health care. Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees. Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and would also worsen the risk of epidemics. Epidemiological surveillance Simple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture. Medical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site. Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis. The epidemiological information presented below was collected in the ""way stations"" on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known. In addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities. Results: A total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration. On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1). Only 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered. It seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort. Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer\'s lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route. Comment The public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier. However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements. This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future. ',)",9407

"(' 06 December 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported The UNHCR has reported on action taken as a result of the laboratory confirmation of cholera on 23 November in a refugee from a Kigoma holding centre. Cholera has since been confirmed in all three holding centres in Kigoma town. As at 4 December, 1 100 cases of presumed cholera had been detected (note: the case definition of presumed cholera is only ""watery diarrhoea"") in the refugee population; six were fatal - three among children under 10 years of age and three in patients over 60 years of age. Six percent of the 1 100 presumed cases required IV rehydration. The population in the holding centres is estimated at 25 000. The number fluctuates as refugees continue to arrive from Zaire and others are transferred from the holding centres to the camps. Based on a total refugee population at risk the 1 100 cases detected correspond to a daily incidence of watery diarrhoea of 5-8 per 1 000. Incidence of bloody diarrhoea is 2 to 3 per thousand per day. Action taken: Improving water, sanitation and living conditions in all three Kigoma holding centres was the first priority. Latrines have been built, water is now available almost continuously and trucks are transporting people out of the holding centres to the camps at a rate of 1 000 persons per day, weather permitting. Daily surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in all camps and holding centres by IRC, MSF and UNHCR is coupled with active case-finding in the holding centres by community health workers. MSF has set up an emergency treatment area in one of the holding centres for oral and IV rehydration and strict hygienic control of the cholera patients. Nyarugusu Camp, which is receiving most of the refugees transferred out of the holding centres, is also ready to treat patients with cholera. Ujiji Hospital, which has a special diarrhoea ward, is being upgraded by MSF logistics. Wards are being rebuilt, electricity is brought in, extra latrines are under construction. Forty extra beds, in addition to the existing 10, will be made available this week. Vibrio cholerae cultures obtained from both refugees and locals have been sent to the Tanzanian Reference Laboratory for confirmation, grouping and sensitivity testing.

Measures were taken immediately to control the spread of infection both in the villages and hospitals with the assistance of a WHO team. Health personnel received training and a public information campaign was launched. It appeared initially that the outbreak was being brought under control. However, at the beginning of December another outbreak occurred in the Booue region, causing 8 deaths. Despite advice to the contrary, some contacts left the region and travelled to Lastourville, where one case was admitted to hospital, and to Libreville where two cases have died during the past week. These cases in Libreville were children who accompanied their father to attend the burial ceremony of a deceased Ebola patient in Booue. The Ministry of Health has made every effort to trace all persons who have been in contact with Ebola patients and to instruct the public on the imperative need to cooperate with the control efforts organized by the government. The Ministry is now satisfied that all contacts have been traced and placed under medical supervision. Seminars and training courses are being held for all personnel involved in the control operation, for which attendance is obligatory. In Booue district, to date there have now been approximately 40 cases with 30 deaths since the start of the epidemic. 9 cases are presently convalescing. In the past few days there have been 4 new cases with 1 death on 23 December. The Ministry of Health and WHO are holding a press conference in Libreville today at 16h00 local time.

"(' 08 January 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported A summary of the outbreak in Gabon The current outbreak in Gabon started on 13 July 1997 with the death of a 39-year-old hunter in a logging camp between the city of Ovan and Koumameyong, near Booué, Ogooué-Ivindo Province. The second case, a close friend of the hunter became ill and died in August, and the third and four deaths were in a traditional healer and his assistant who treated him. They occurred late in September and blood specimens from them were confirmed Ebola positive on 4 October by the Centre International de Recherche de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon. The outbreak was brought under control and by 13 November 1997, it numbered 24 cases (clinical and epidemiological case definition from Kikwit) including 17 deaths and only one known contact still requiring surveillance. However, on 27 October, a doctor infected in Libreville by a case linked to the Booué outbreak, went to South Africa for treatment after having developed symptoms. He subsequently infected a nurse in Johannesburg. The nurse become ill on November 2 and died on 24 November. On 26 November, a previously unidentified contact in Gabon died in the village of Djidjii, near Booué, and his burial was attended by his brother and his family from Libreville. His brother came back to Libreville with his three children as well as the children of the deceased. All were regularly followed up and 3 developed symptoms of Ebola infection and died in a Libreville hospital. One of them who became ill on 21 December and died on 30 December, is the last recorded case. As of date 8 January 1997, the outbreak, ongoing since July 1997, has caused 54 cases including 41 deaths, three hospitalised cases and 10 who have recocered. There has been no documented secondary transmission in Libreville other than that of the doctor who flew to South Africa. A total of 167 contacts are still under daily surveillance. All known contacts have been located and are followed up daily. It is possible that few of them may have been infected and will therefore develop disease. International travel: WHO does not recommend any travel restriction either to or from Gabon or any other Ebola endemic country. However, it is recommended for all travellers going to an Ebola endemic area, with the specific intention to provide health care or perform laboratory tests from human or animal specimens, that they be aware of the risk of infection from Ebola and other pathogens and adhere strictly to good hygiene and biosafety practices. Travellers arriving from an Ebola endemic area who have been in physical contact with a case should inform the health authority immediately on their arrival to ensure daily temperature check up for a period of three weeks. There is no epidemiological evidence that persons infected but asymptomatic are infectious to others. Only symptomatic persons (e.g. contact subject with fever) should be considered as suspect cases and, consequently, potentially infectious. Since severely ill patients excreting abundant body fluids are not likely to travel, the risk to travellers of becoming infected by the Ebola virus during travel is considered negligible. However, the risk of health care providers becoming infected through close physical contact with an Ebola patient should be considered, even if statistically low. This is particularly important for health workers in areas receiving a significant number of passengers from Ebola endemic areas. For individuals entering the country from an infected area, a simple information leaflet can be used to inform arriving travellers of the need to report any febrile illness occurring up to 21 days after arrival. A questionnaire may be proposed to help tracing if necessary. Such procedures are at the discretion of governments and are not required under the International Health Regulations. ',)",54

Cholera was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur and the University of Kinshasa from stool specimens collected by Médecins Sans Frontières. The cases were detected through the epidemiological surveillance system set up by Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF)/Epicentre in the camp. General health situation: According to MSF/Epicentre the surveillance system registered increasing daily crude mortality rates which reached 4 per 10 000 in the week beginning 6 January. Fifty-four percent of the deaths occurred in children under five. The main causes of death were malnutrition, diarrhoea and malaria. As of 13 January, 200 children had been admitted to intensive feeding centres and more than 1 800 children were given supplementary food rations. The nutritional situation is expected to further deteriorate since only 30 tons of the 70 tons needed can be distributed daily. Acute diarrhoea accounted for 15% of attendance at the health centre and malaria for 40%. Cerebral malaria was the main cause of death in adults. As the camp is located in a high endemicity area and the refugee population is likely to have low immunity against Plasmodium falciparum, malaria is expected to increase during the rainy season which is approaching. The distribution of an adequate food ration to the entire population of the camp is the top health priority.

However, in recently affected rural areas coordination of control activities is difficult. Based on trends of cholera outbreaks in previous years, a decline in numbers is expected in the next six to eight weeks.

"(' 01 May 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported Lassa fever re-emerged as a public health problem in Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone during 1997. From January to 19 April 1997, 799 cases with 148 deaths (CFR 18.5%) were reported. In the endemic Lassa fever situation an annual average of 40-50 cases normally occurred in this region. An elevated number of Lassa fever cases has continued to occur in 1997 with 45 cases reported in January, 75 in February and 147 in March. The increased occurrence is closely related to massive population movements with subsequent crowding, poor sanitation, unsafe food handling and storage practices combined with an increase in the rat population. Furthermore, with the improving political and security situation in Sierra Leone, the populace is moving about more freely to access health care facilities resulting in increased case reporting. The Ministry of Health, WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA and MERLIN, United Kingdom have worked together to monitor the outbreak and to mitigate its impact. Patients are brought to and treated at an isolation ward established in Kenema which has been expanded to accommodate the increase in cases. Several workshops have been held to train health staff and to educate the general public about measures to avoid contact with rodents. Supplies of ribavirin, the antiviral drug used to treat Lassa virus infections, were nearly depleted. The Red Cross was contacted regarding this need and the Chinese Red Cross responded with a donation of 120,000 doses of the drug to the Government of Sierra Leone. WHO is working with the pharmaceutical industry on a long-term solution.. (Based on a report from WHO representative in Sierra Leone.) Comment: Transmission of the Lassa virus in the community is mainly due to contact with rats of the genus Mastomys. Infected rats continually shed viruses in their urine and humans are infected by ingestion of food contaminated with rat urine or inhalation of virus-containing aerosols. Minimizing contact with rodents by the safe handling and storage of food or restricting access of rats to homes, remains therefore the most effective preventive measure. Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily in health care institutions caring for Lassa patients. Nosocomial spread can easily be prevented by managing patients in isolation wards and with appropriate protective measures (barrier nursing). The risk of transmission during international travel is low unless the traveller is in contact with a severely ill and bleeding case. A recent incident involving a virus which causes a similar clinial syndrome occurred in South Africa where a nurse was infected with Ebola virus while caring for a patient from an endemic area. This underscores the importance of health care staff awareness and use of special precautions when treating patients who have travelled abroad. ',)",799

During the period March to May 1997, 170 cases suspected to be monkeypox were reported: 58 in March, 52 in April and 60 in May. There were no deaths. Most (134/170) cases were in children under 16 years of age. Katako-Kombe, where the outbreak was first registered in 1997, accounted for 112 of the cases which occurred during March, April and May 1997. The remaining 58 cases occurred in neighbouring Lodja Nord (47 cases) and Lodja Sud (11 cases). Cases of poxvirus-like illness were also observed in Kinshasa in January/February 1997. Laboratory investigations have confirmed infection with an orthopoxvirus in this outbreak. The WHO epidemiologist who originally investigated the suspect cases of monkeypox in Kinshasa has recently returned to the area and reported that no further human-to-human transmission has occurred since his last visit there in March. Comment: A possible reason for the increased occurrence of monkeypox could be the growing proportion of the population which has not received the vaccinia vaccine which was used to protect against smallpox until that disease was eradicated. It has been suggested that vaccinia vaccine be given to protect the population at risk of monkeypox. Such a recommendation requires careful evaluation in view of the high risk of adverse effects of vaccinia vaccine, particularly in a population which may be immunocompromised due to HIV infection. To further study the cause of the outbreak and recommend protective measures, WHO, its partners from Collaborating Centres, and the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire) initiated a joint investigation in February 1997. In view of the unstable political and social situation in the country, the team had to be evacuated after 10 days before sufficient information could be collected to make complete recommendations.

Of the 419 suspect cases identified by the team in October 1997, 344 occurred in the Katako Kombe health zone and 75 in the Lodja health zone. Fourteen of them had active disease. Most (85%) of the 344 suspect cases resident in the Katako-Kombe zone were in children under 16 years of age. Thirty-one per cent had had moderate or severe rash, i.e. more than 100 skin lesions, and in 41% the eruption lasted longer than one week. Fever, diarrhoea, cervical lympadenopathy, sore throat and mouth ulcers were the most common symptoms. Ten were hospitalised for up to 30 days and 54% were incapacitated for more than three days. Five died (case fatality ratio 1.5%). These individuals ranged in age from four to eight years and all died within three weeks of rash onset. Twenty had scar evidence of vaccinia vaccination and 19 reported a past history of chicken pox.

Of these secondary cases, 48% reported contact with another suspect case in the compound, 42% in the household and 53% in the neighbourhood (some had more than one contact). Primary cases with no apparent connection to Akungula and Ekanga villages, were reported from 49 of the total 78 villages where cases were found. Thirty- five per cent of the 419 cases reported being outside their home village in the three weeks before disease onset - the majority in the forest. This outbreak represents the largest ever reported cluster of suspect cases spread over a large area of the Katako-Kombe and Lodja zones. The clinical disease was milder but household secondary attack rate was higher than previously documented, possibly due to an increased number of susceptible individuals after the cessation of vaccinia vaccination, rather than increased person to person transmission. Some of the serum specimens obtained from suspect cases have been positive for varicella, and final analysis will take this into account. Transmission seems to have now ceased at the original epicentre of the outbreak and the immediate surrounding villages. The more recently detected suspect human cases occurred in more geographically distant clusters, the majority with no apparent link to the original outbreak. These suspect cases of sporadic transmission may be due to independent introductions of virus into the human population through increased animal contact.

"(' 08 June 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported Many countries/areas in south-east Asia (Malaysia, Taiwan [China], Cambodia, Viet Nam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar), the western Pacific (Guam, Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Kiribati) and Latin America (Brazil, Venezuela, Columbia) have recently been experiencing unusually high levels of dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever activity. Although there is often a seasonal increase in dengue in some of these countries/areas at this time of the year, the level of activity in 1998 is considerably higher than in previous years. Changes in weather patterns as a result of the El Nino phenomenon are thought to be a major contributing factor. Unless more effective measures are taken to control the main vector, Aedes aegypti, in these and other countries/areas, dengue will continue to be a growing problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Essential elements of an effective programme are integrated mosquito control with community and intersectoral involvement, vector surveillance for monitoring and evaluation, emergency preparedness, capacity building and training, and applied research. A total of 16,647 cases of dengue/dengue haemorraghic fever with 55 deaths (case fatality rate = 0.3%) has been reported since the beginning of 1998. The incidence of cases has more than doubled compared with the same period last year. In 1997 the number of dengue cases reported (108,000 cases and 245 deaths) was the highest since 1991. As the traditional peak season for dengue (June to November) has only just started a major epidemic is expected to occur. While dengue 2 virus was the most prevalent strain in 1997, early data suggests that dengue 3 virus predominates this year, but it should be noted that very few viruses have been typed. Six provinces in southern Viet Nam have been provided with materials for surveillance and testing and all provincial district hospitals in the southern region have been supplied with haematocrit equipment for the management of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever. A total of 5,337 cases (of which 194 were dengue haemorraghic fever) with five deaths has been reported since the beginning of 1998. The number of cases is comparable to the number reported for the same period last year. The 1997 total of reported cases (19,544 cases and 50 deaths) was the highest since 1990. As the traditional dengue season only began in May it is too early to assess the trend during 1998. There has been a rapid increase recently in dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever cases and all provinces of the country are now affected. As of 5 May a total of 32,665 cases with 774 deaths had been reported. This number of cases is considerably higher than in the same period last year. It is expected that cases will continue to increase during the peak transmission season of May to July. WHO is assisting the Ministry of Health in their efforts to control the situation by providing guidelines on clinical management of cases and laboratory services during epidemics, sending an expert to assist in developing a control strategy, and providing support for laboratory studies. This year Brazil is experiencing the highest levels of dengue transmission in its history. A total of 234,828 cases was reported during the first four months of 1998, compared with 159,965 cases during the same period in 1997 and 254,942 cases reported for the entire year in1997. Transmission appears to have peaked in April, as it did last year. There have been 60 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever reported and eight deaths. Both dengue 1 and dengue 2 viruses are circulating. Approximately 60% of all dengue cases in the Americas are reported from Brazil, but less than 1% of the dengue haemorrhagic fever cases. The area with the greatest transmission has been the south-east region, with 89,000 cases in the State of Minas Gerais and 35,000 cases in the State of Espirito Santo. All but four of the 27 states/territories in Brazil are affected. In 1997 Brazil launched its Aedes aegypti Eradication Program. About US$448 millions were spent to hire, train and equip tens of thousands of inspectors to visit each house in infested areas every three months to eliminate breeding sites. Unfortunately, the deployment process has been very slow, because it involves making contracts with each of the 2,500 infested municipalities. At present, inspectors are working in 1,300 municipalities. Emergency measures have included ultra-low-volume application of insecticides with vehicle- mounted sprayers, massive dissemination of information to the public about Aedes breeding sites and how to eliminate them, and plans for aircraft application of insecticide.

"(' 26 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported PAHO/WHO REPORT ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA Cholera: As of November 20, the Ministry of Public Health has reported six cases and one death (San Alejo, La Union). V. cholera 01 El Tor Owaga has been isolated in one case. Of the six reported cases, four were imported from Jutiapa, Guatemala; the other two originated in border areas of El Salvador (Metepán, Santa Ana and San Alejo, La Unión.) On 19 November, an outbreak of diarrheal disease erupted in the San Juan de Dios Hospital in the department of Santa Ana on the Guatemala border. All fifteen cases required hospitalization. This is a suspected outbreak of cholera which is attributed to ingestion of food sold by a street vendor from Jutiapa, Guatemala. The Ministry of Health initiated a public information and health education campaign and launched activities to control the disease, targeting the areas along the Guatemala border. Cholera: The Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health reported that between 4-20 November there were 234 confirmed cases of cholera out of a total of 261 reported. There were 17 deaths. On 20 November, an outbreak was reported in the Mental Health Hospital of Guatemala, with 18 confirmed cases and one death. In Chinaltenango that same day, there were 27 suspected cases and 37 confirmed cases, which correspond to the cumulative total notified cases for that area in the last two weeks. All reported outbreaks implied food-borne transmission. Reporting by epidemiological weeks (through Week 45-November 14), as reported by the Health Information Management System (SIGSA) on 19 November, shows a clear rise in cholera beginning in Week 37 (September 13). However, this information service reports 395 cases of cholera during Week 44 (November 1-7) and 511 cases during Week 45 (November 8-14), sharply higher than the figures reported by the Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health. Diagnostic measures have been strengthened and treatment of cases and contacts stepped up. Leptospirosis: On 23 November, the Surveillance Department reported six cases of leptospirosis, five of which were confirmed. Four of the cases occurred in Guatemala City and two in Escuintla. No deaths were reported. Dengue: SIGSA reports 277 cases of dengue for Week 45, a rise of almost 200 cases from the previous week. Malaria: According to SIGSA, the situation is stable. Cholera: As of 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 335 cases of cholera, 301 of which were confirmed. Managua reported 156 cases or 52% , followed by Carazo (46 cases), Masaya (25) and Matagalpa (18 cases). According to an analysis of trends by the Epidemiological Surveillance System, one can observe an increase in Week 45, with 102 cases. Seventy-five were reported the preceding week. The Ministry of Health has taken measures to treat the cases, distribute chlorine, and conduct community education and environmental health campaigns. Leptospirosis: Up to 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 264 suspected cases of leptospirosis, 98.1% of which were in Chinandega and Estelí (136 and 123 cases respectively). Of the 182 samples processed in laboratories, 42 resulted positive for Leptospira (23%). The Ministry of Health is sending medical brigades and epidemiologists to the affected departments and strengthening control measures and community support. Dengue: The Ministry of Health reports a rise in notification of cases during the last two weeks. Malaria: According to information from the Ministry, the situation is stable. Cholera: As of 21 November, the Ministry of Health reported three confirmed cases of cholera and 11 suspected cases in Regions 1, 3 and 4 of the country. Leptospirosis: On 20 November, the Ministry of Health reported and outbreak of febrile illness compatible with leptospirosis in three municipalities (San Pedro Zula, Choloma and La Lima in the department of Cortes (Region 3). Four cases were reported with three deaths. Two of the cases were serologically confirmed. The Ministry of Health has sent an epidemiological team to the field, strengthening the diagnostic capacity and improving epidemiological surveillance efforts. Dengue: As of 21 November, the Ministry reported 1,080 cases of classic dengue, 444 of which occurred in Region 3. A total of 33 suspected cases of hemorragic dengue have been analyzed, and 15 of these were confirmed. The remainder are being studied. To date, 4 people have died. Cholera: Health authorities report, as of 20 November, an outbreak of cholera en Saint Martin Village in the Cayo District, with 11 suspected cases and five confirmed. The latter have been hospitalized in the Belmopan Hospital. In one case, a 78-year-old person died 12 hours after being hospitalized. The suspected source of infection was contaminated drinking water from the Roaring Creek. Fifty-two contacts received treatment. The following situations can be identified from available information: * there is epidemic activity of cholera in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch. Guatemala has the highest risk. * there is epidemic activity of leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. The area at greatest risk is Estelí and Chinandega, Nicaragua. * there is epidemic activity of hemorragic dengue in the metropolitan region of Honduras. PAHO recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the local and national health authorities in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch to control the risk of epidemics. These efforts, particularly the improved epidemiological surveillance, have sharply increased the capacity to suspect and detect cases as well as to confirm instances and eventually treat diseases that have the potential to cause epidemics. Consequently, we can expect a significant increase in the epidemiological reporting of cases in the coming weeks. However, PAHO recommends the immediate establishment of the following measures: Cholera: 1) Strengthen health control measures, including basic hygiene measures, provision of safe water, and handling and consumption of food from street vendors, among the at-risk population, particularly in shelters. 2) Intensify local epidemiological surveillance measures of cholera (active identification of cases) in the affected population. 3) Implement social communication campaigns particularly in shelters and among the displaced population and native communities. Leptospirosis: 1) Strengthen the local capacity to diagnose and quickly treat cases. 2) Stimulate community participation in expanding the application of preventive measures and the early detection of suspected cases. 3) Step up health surveillance measures, including rodent control. Hemorragic Dengue: 1) Ensure that health authorities have prompt access to suspected cases. 2) Intensify health measures to control vectors. 3) Strengthen local community participation in the control of breeding sites of mosquitos.

Of the 182 samples processed in laboratories, 42 resulted positive for Leptospira (23%). The Ministry of Health is sending medical brigades and epidemiologists to the affected departments and strengthening control measures and community support. Dengue: The Ministry of Health reports a rise in notification of cases during the last two weeks. Malaria: According to information from the Ministry, the situation is stable. Cholera: As of 21 November, the Ministry of Health reported three confirmed cases of cholera and 11 suspected cases in Regions 1, 3 and 4 of the country. Leptospirosis: On 20 November, the Ministry of Health reported and outbreak of febrile illness compatible with leptospirosis in three municipalities (San Pedro Zula, Choloma and La Lima in the department of Cortes (Region 3). Four cases were reported with three deaths. Two of the cases were serologically confirmed. The Ministry of Health has sent an epidemiological team to the field, strengthening the diagnostic capacity and improving epidemiological surveillance efforts. Dengue: As of 21 November, the Ministry reported 1,080 cases of classic dengue, 444 of which occurred in Region 3. A total of 33 suspected cases of hemorragic dengue have been analyzed, and 15 of these were confirmed. The remainder are being studied. To date, 4 people have died. Cholera: Health authorities report, as of 20 November, an outbreak of cholera en Saint Martin Village in the Cayo District, with 11 suspected cases and five confirmed. The latter have been hospitalized in the Belmopan Hospital. In one case, a 78-year-old person died 12 hours after being hospitalized. The suspected source of infection was contaminated drinking water from the Roaring Creek. Fifty-two contacts received treatment. The following situations can be identified from available information: * there is epidemic activity of cholera in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch. Guatemala has the highest risk. * there is epidemic activity of leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. The area at greatest risk is Estelí and Chinandega, Nicaragua. * there is epidemic activity of hemorragic dengue in the metropolitan region of Honduras. PAHO recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the local and national health authorities in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch to control the risk of epidemics. These efforts, particularly the improved epidemiological surveillance, have sharply increased the capacity to suspect and detect cases as well as to confirm instances and eventually treat diseases that have the potential to cause epidemics. Consequently, we can expect a significant increase in the epidemiological reporting of cases in the coming weeks. However, PAHO recommends the immediate establishment of the following measures: Cholera: 1) Strengthen health control measures, including basic hygiene measures, provision of safe water, and handling and consumption of food from street vendors, among the at-risk population, particularly in shelters. 2) Intensify local epidemiological surveillance measures of cholera (active identification of cases) in the affected population. 3) Implement social communication campaigns particularly in shelters and among the displaced population and native communities. Leptospirosis: 1) Strengthen the local capacity to diagnose and quickly treat cases. 2) Stimulate community participation in expanding the application of preventive measures and the early detection of suspected cases. 3) Step up health surveillance measures, including rodent control. Hemorragic Dengue: 1) Ensure that health authorities have prompt access to suspected cases. 2) Intensify health measures to control vectors. 3) Strengthen local community participation in the control of breeding sites of mosquitos.

Dengue: As of 21 November, the Ministry reported 1,080 cases of classic dengue, 444 of which occurred in Region 3. A total of 33 suspected cases of hemorragic dengue have been analyzed, and 15 of these were confirmed. The remainder are being studied. To date, 4 people have died. Cholera: Health authorities report, as of 20 November, an outbreak of cholera en Saint Martin Village in the Cayo District, with 11 suspected cases and five confirmed. The latter have been hospitalized in the Belmopan Hospital. In one case, a 78-year-old person died 12 hours after being hospitalized. The suspected source of infection was contaminated drinking water from the Roaring Creek. Fifty-two contacts received treatment. The following situations can be identified from available information: * there is epidemic activity of cholera in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch. Guatemala has the highest risk. * there is epidemic activity of leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. The area at greatest risk is Estelí and Chinandega, Nicaragua. * there is epidemic activity of hemorragic dengue in the metropolitan region of Honduras. PAHO recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the local and national health authorities in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch to control the risk of epidemics. These efforts, particularly the improved epidemiological surveillance, have sharply increased the capacity to suspect and detect cases as well as to confirm instances and eventually treat diseases that have the potential to cause epidemics. Consequently, we can expect a significant increase in the epidemiological reporting of cases in the coming weeks. However, PAHO recommends the immediate establishment of the following measures: Cholera: 1) Strengthen health control measures, including basic hygiene measures, provision of safe water, and handling and consumption of food from street vendors, among the at-risk population, particularly in shelters. 2) Intensify local epidemiological surveillance measures of cholera (active identification of cases) in the affected population. 3) Implement social communication campaigns particularly in shelters and among the displaced population and native communities. Leptospirosis: 1) Strengthen the local capacity to diagnose and quickly treat cases. 2) Stimulate community participation in expanding the application of preventive measures and the early detection of suspected cases. 3) Step up health surveillance measures, including rodent control. Hemorragic Dengue: 1) Ensure that health authorities have prompt access to suspected cases. 2) Intensify health measures to control vectors. 3) Strengthen local community participation in the control of breeding sites of mosquitos.

V. cholera 01 El Tor Owaga has been isolated in one case. Of the six reported cases, four were imported from Jutiapa, Guatemala; the other two originated in border areas of El Salvador (Metepán, Santa Ana and San Alejo, La Unión.) On 19 November, an outbreak of diarrheal disease erupted in the San Juan de Dios Hospital in the department of Santa Ana on the Guatemala border. All fifteen cases required hospitalization. This is a suspected outbreak of cholera which is attributed to ingestion of food sold by a street vendor from Jutiapa, Guatemala. The Ministry of Health initiated a public information and health education campaign and launched activities to control the disease, targeting the areas along the Guatemala border.

Malaria: Based on daily reporting from shelters, 208 cases of malaria were reported between the 26th and 28th of November; the cumulative number of cases to date for the post-Mitch period is 1,908. Regions 3, 4 and 8 report the largest number of cases. Leptospirosos: To date, 18 suspected cases of leptospirosis have been reported, 6 of which were confirmed in preliminary tests (all in Region 3 – San Pedro Sula), and pending further tests; there was one death. Dengue: Between the 26th and 28th of November, 45 new cases of classic dengue were reported, totaling 1,165 cases. Although no cases of hemorrhagic dengue in shelters were confirmed, 49 confirmed cases of hemorrhagic dengue were reported in the country as of week 46 (up to 21 November), of which 70% originated in the Central District. BELIZE Cholera: According to information received today, one of the two new suspected cases of cholera reported on the 27th is that of a 4-year old boy, known to one of the previously notified patients and from the Saint Martin Village area in the district of Cayo. The child was hospitalized and the infection confirmed as V. cholerae 01 El Tor Ogawa. No new cases were reported. The second suspected case has been hospitalized and is under study. Analysis of the Epidemiological Situation as of 30 November, 1998 Having concluded epidemiological week 47, the fourth post-Mitch week, the epidemiological situation was marked by: Cholera epidemic activity in the five countries affected by Mitch was at the highest risk in Guatemala. Leptospirosis epidemic activity in Nicaragua. Low activity in Honduras and Guatemala. El Salvador and Belize did not report presence of cases in post- Mitch period. Dengue epidemic activity in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Honduras and Nicaragua reported the presence of hemorrhagic dengue. Although, to date, the epidemiological situation has not manifested itself as an eruption attributable to the extraordinary efforts of prevention and outbreak control provided by each country's health teams, the present epidemic risk conditions demand strengthening epidemiological surveillance and vector activities both in populations exposed to the open and those in shelters.

Although no cases of hemorrhagic dengue in shelters were confirmed, 49 confirmed cases of hemorrhagic dengue were reported in the country as of week 46 (up to 21 November), of which 70% originated in the Central District. BELIZE Cholera: According to information received today, one of the two new suspected cases of cholera reported on the 27th is that of a 4-year old boy, known to one of the previously notified patients and from the Saint Martin Village area in the district of Cayo. The child was hospitalized and the infection confirmed as V. cholerae 01 El Tor Ogawa. No new cases were reported. The second suspected case has been hospitalized and is under study. Analysis of the Epidemiological Situation as of 30 November, 1998 Having concluded epidemiological week 47, the fourth post-Mitch week, the epidemiological situation was marked by: Cholera epidemic activity in the five countries affected by Mitch was at the highest risk in Guatemala. Leptospirosis epidemic activity in Nicaragua. Low activity in Honduras and Guatemala. El Salvador and Belize did not report presence of cases in post- Mitch period. Dengue epidemic activity in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Honduras and Nicaragua reported the presence of hemorrhagic dengue. Although, to date, the epidemiological situation has not manifested itself as an eruption attributable to the extraordinary efforts of prevention and outbreak control provided by each country's health teams, the present epidemic risk conditions demand strengthening epidemiological surveillance and vector activities both in populations exposed to the open and those in shelters.

"(' 04 December 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported There have recently been reports of a small number of deaths and a larger number of cases of diarrhoea (with and without vomiting) in the province of Cabo Delgado. This outbreak has been attributed to the consumption of fish contaminated with pesticides, but little scientific data are available to substantiate these claims. Concurrently, there are outbreaks of both cholera and dysentery in the country and local health services have difficulty differentiating between symptoms of chemical poisoning and illness caused by microbial pathogens. Approximately 100 deaths have occurred and about 600 cases of illness have been reported by the provincial health authorities, but attributing these to either chemical or microbiological contamination of food or water consumed is not possible because of lack of reliable scientific data. According to local health authorities in Cabo Delgado, there have been 2 deaths since 24 November, and the outbreak is under control. Data from the Ministry of Health suggest that most of the cases of diarrhoea reported in Cabo Delgado province have been associated with cholera and dysentery, rather than with pesticide poisoning. Thus caution is advised in the absence of reliable epidemiological data. It would appear that the ""toxic event"" associated with pesticide poisoning has passed its peak. The consumption of dried fish may be a possible route of exposure to toxic levels of pesticides, as the use of non-food-grade pesticides has been frequently reported in different parts of the world as a method for reducing insect spoilage of dried fish. The fisheries services in Mozambique are taking the appropriate prevention and control measures, and are collecting samples to be forwarded to an international reference laboratory for analysis. WHO has assembled a multidisciplinary advisory team in consultation with the national government agencies concerned and FAO. ',)",600

Three associated human cases have also been reported, all with a benign febrile illness. Towards the end of January, six pregnant buffalo were observed to abort, and, shortly after, 3 giraffes and 1 waterbuck were found dead without obvious signs of predator attack. Three veterinarians in contact with tissues from these animals developed an uncomplicated, febrile illness. Deaths among goat kids in adjacent areas have also been recorded. Virus has been detected in tissues from the buffalo fetuses, the waterbuck, a giraffe, and 1 veterinarian. A program of control measures has been instituted: local farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock, and public health information on appropriate precautions has been disseminated to those involved in the livestock industry. Mosquito control measures have been increased in tourist destinations. However, most human cases of RVF reported in the past from South Africa were acquired through contact with diseased animals and their tissues, rather than through mosquito bites, so the general public is not perceived to be at particular risk of contracting the illness. Large outbreaks of RVF occurred in South Africa's inland plateau in 1974-76, and a small outbreak was recorded in 1981 in a coastal area of KwaZulu-Natal, but no disease activity has been detected in the intervening period.

MSF is establishing a ward to isolate patients and training local healthcare staff to use barrier nursing procedures and protective equipment. Marburg virus infections, a lethal relative of Ebola (both viruses are in the Filovirus family), are found in sub-Saharan Africa and occur infrequently. Since the virus was first recognized in 1967 when laboratory workers in Marburg, Germany and Belgrade, Yugoslavia were infected by handling monkeys and monkey tissues from animals imported from Uganda, there have only been three reports of sporadic cases (1975 in Zimbabwe and South Africa, and in 1980 and 1987 in Kenya). The virus is transmitted to people following contact with infected animals and animal tissues, and from person-to-person by close contact with infected patients and body fluids. The natural reservoirs of Marburg virus and of Ebola virus are unknown. Both the Marburg and Ebola viruses are often characterized by the sudden onset of fever, malaise, muscle pain, headache and conjunctivitis. This is followed by sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and both internal and external bleeding. Liver function may be abnormal and platelet function may be impaired. No specific treatment or vaccine exists for Marburg disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids. Experimental studies involving the use of hyperimmune sera on animals demonstrated no long-term protection against the disease after interruption of therapy. Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients and strict barrier nursing techniques practised. All hospital personnel should be briefed on the nature of the disease and its routes of transmission. Particular emphasis should be placed on ensuring that high-risk procedures such as the placing of intravenous lines and the handling of blood, secretions, catheters and suction devices are done under barrier nursing conditions. Hospital staff should have individual gowns, gloves and masks. Gloves and masks must not be reused unless disinfected. Patients who die from the disease should be promptly buried or cremated.

Fifty percent of the cases have been in persons >15 years old, 44.4% have been in children ages 1-15 years and 5.6% (representing one case) have been in children <1 year of age. Most of the cases have occurred in males (72.2%). The outbreak seems to be concentrated in two municipalities\x97 Afuá and Breves, in the State of Para. Reports from Brazil show that many of the cases from Afuá were identified through active surveillance and serological surveys after a death due to yellow fever occurred in February 1999. Although a vaccination campaign was carried out in Afuá achieving 100% coverage, cases continue to occur due to the migration of unimmunized people into the area. Families are migrating to this area for work, primarily harvesting heart of palm. In the process of harvesting the trees, the habitat of the mosquitoes is disrupted and contact with humans, including unimmunized young children, occurs. Colombia: To date in 1999, the total number of confirmed sylvatic cases is two and both cases were fatal. These two cases were in males, ages 17 and 21 years. The cases occurred in the Departments of Caqueta and Meta. No cases have been reported since January. Peru: The first confirmed case of sylvatic yellow fever for 1999 was reported in a 25 year old male from the department of Loreto, Amazon region who died on 7 April. In response to this case, mass yellow fever vaccination was initiated in the area. Other cases have occurred in San Martin Department, in the districts of Moyobamba, Jepelacio and Alonso de Alvarado (26 cases), Ayacucho Department in the province of La Mar, district of Anco y Santa Rosa (12 cases), Huanuco Department (5 cases) and Junin Department (5 cases).

"(' 20 May 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported To date, 72 suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) have been reported, based on a revised case definition. The exact number of deaths due to VHF has not been established, owing to the lack of precise information about the clinical picture of those who have died during the past several months. Samples from only 9 cases have been available for testing. Three of the 9 patients tested have confirmed Marburg virus infection by antigen testing, virus isolation and PCR. Specimens from all 3 patients with Marburg infection were positive in all 3 assays. Samples from the other 6 patients (66%) were negative by virus detection methods and antibody testing, suggesting another etiology. All three confirmed cases of Marburg fever have died, the latest being a miner who died on 13 May. Blood samples from those living in the affected area and from health care workers (total of approximately 1000 persons) have been collected. These seroprevalence studies are expected to yield valuable information about the epidemiology of Marburg virus infections in this outbreak of haemorrhagic fever. Ecological studies to determine the reservoir of the Marburg virus have begun. Many participants in the coordination committee* are expected to leave Durba within the next several days. An active surveillance system has been established and sufficient personnel staff will be on-site to monitor events. * The coordination committee is composed of experts from: the Ministry of Health and local health authorities; WHO headquarters and the African Region; UNDP; Médecins sans frontières (Belgium and Holland); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (United States); Institut Pasteur (France, French Guiana and Madagascar); Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium).

"("" 19 November 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported The Ministry of Health of Fiji has submitted the following information to WHO. On 30 July 1999, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand reported an imported case of cholera to WHO and to the Ministry of Health of Fiji. Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor subtype Ogawa had been confirmed in a 26-year-old male from New Zealand who had visited a small offshore reef island in Fiji as a tourist in June 1999. He had experienced onset of symptoms on the fourth day of his visit. A similar case in a visitor from New Zealand, possibly acquired at the same Fiji island resort, was investigated by the Ministry of Health of Fiji 8 months earlier. No other cases were found at that time. After the second report, the Ministry of Health of Fiji launched a thorough investigation, in collaboration with WHO. No further cholera cases have been detected, but the investigators did find evidence of faecal contamination of the island's fresh water source (i.e. the groundwater lens) and of the salt water intake for a desalination facility purchased by the resort a few years earlier. Water samples from boreholes that draw from the groundwater lens have revealed the presence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus O36, and V. cholerae O19. Vibrio cholerae O1 has not been found in the water samples taken. The island's drinking-water is separately obtained from a rainwater catchment system, supplemented by barged water from outside the island, and supplied to guest rooms in plastic jugs. All water sources (borehole, desalinator, rain catchment, and barged water) are chlorinated before distribution. Although the borehole and desalinated water is not intended for drinking, investigators considered it likely that the infections had occurred either by consumption of foods contaminated in the kitchen with inadequately treated borehole water, or by inadvertent consumption of the water itself when free residual chlorine was absent. Revised chlorination procedures are currently in place to provide added protection in the short term for residents and visitors. Other measures have already been taken to provide a long-term solution on the affected island. There is no evidence to suggest that a problem exists in Fiji beyond this small resort island, and Fiji's water supply is generally considered safe. Note: The public health response in this case illustrates the usefulness of quick and effective communication between countries.

All cases which have been investigated have occurred among unvaccinated persons. The most recent YF vaccination campaign in the area was conducted in 1999 but was limited to a single refugee camp. Most of the refugees who were vaccinated in that exercise have left the area. A nationwide YF vaccination campaign was conducted in 1995, but coverage was reported to be low, leaving much of the population susceptible.

This viral haemorrhagic fever causes severe disease amongst both humans and animals, posing a serious public health risk and economic losses due to loss of livestock. In September 2000, RVF was reported for the first time outside Africa. Cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. As of 9 October 2000, 321 cases with 32 deaths, and a case fatality rate of 10%, have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health, Yemen. The response requires strengthening the basic infrastructure, epidemiological surveillance and human resources in Yemen that are needed for dealing with this emergency. In particular, the economic impact of the restriction on animal movement and trade is causing severe hardship amongst local inhabitants. High-level agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen to conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of the international response to control the disease on both sides of the border. WHO experts are working with both governments in the outbreak zone. Funds mobilized through the WHO Appeal will help to control and contain the outbreak of RVF within the immediately affected districts in Yemen, and build local capacity to predict and prevent further occurrence. The Appeal seeks support for vector surveillance and control, strengthening laboratory capacity, capacity building and human resource development, strengthening epidemiological surveillance of RVF and providing essential supplies, equipment and critical supportive materials. An urgent response to the Appeal is needed to assist the Government of Yemen and strengthen local capacity to take effective action on the first reported cases of RVF outside traditionally-affected areas in Africa. RVF is a zoonotic disease. It primarily affects animals (cattle, sheep, camels, goats) but can cause outbreaks of disease in humans. Usually, the virus is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. During RVF outbreaks, people become infected with RVF either by being bitten by mosquitoes or through contact with the blood, other body fluids or organs of infected animals. Such contact may occur during the care or slaughtering of infected animals or possibly from the ingestion of raw milk. ______________________________________________________________________________________ For more information on Rift Valley fever in Yemen please see previous report.

As reported to WHO on 16 October 2000 by the WHO Collaborating Centre, the National Institute for Virology (NIV) in South Africa, test results had confirmed that Ebola virus was cause of the disease. NIV has now characterized the virus strain as similar to, but not identical to Ebola-Sudan. Ebola-Sudan was associated with a case-fatality rate of between 50-70% in disease outbreaks in southern Sudan in 1976 and 1979. The strain appears to be somewhat less virulent than the Ebola-Zaire strain, which has caused epidemics in the former Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo, and Gabon with a case- fatality rate of between 70-90%. Both Ebola strains and the closely-related Marburg virus are found in the central region of Africa. While this is the first recognized outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda, it is possible that the strain from the present outbreak has been in Uganda for some time. Infection control and case management in Gulu district are continuing. A Community Alert System has been established for actively seeking cases and tracing contacts. Health education messages are also being widely disseminated and public health awareness about EHF has greatly increased in the community. Mobile teams of epidemiologists and trained health care workers are investigating all suspected cases reported to the operations centre in Gulu and are transporting persons who meet the case definition for the disease to one of the two hospital isolation units. These mobile teams are also tracing contacts of cases. Control efforts are progressing well. At present, the measures taken in the hospital isolation wards make it unlikely that any virus transmission will occur in this setting.

"(' 27 April 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported During 2000, there was an international outbreak of meningococcal disease caused by an unusual serogroup: W135 During 2001 the following countries have reported cases of W135 meningococcal disease, associated with international travel or contact with travellers to Saudi Arabia, to WHO: Burkina Faso: 4 cases have been reported. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed. Central African Republic: 3 cases (Haj pilgrims) have been reported. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed. France: 2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims) and no deaths have been reported. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed. Norway: 4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) and no deaths have been reported. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed. Saudi Arabia: 109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia) including 35 deaths reported between 9 February and 22 March 2001\\. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more than half of the cases. Singapore: 4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims, 1 history of travel to Saudi Arabia) and no deaths have been reported. Two of the cases occurred in January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 28 laboratory confirmed cases including 7 deaths have been reported. Out of these cases, 8 were pilgrims returning from the Haj, 9 were close contacts of the latter, and data are outstanding on the remaining cases. 2 cases occurred in January prior to the main pilgrimage period. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed. Meningococcal disease. As with all types of meningococcal disease, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group W135 meningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease: sudden onset of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting, photophobia and stiff neck. The most severe clinical form of the disease, meningococcal septicaemia can be presented by abrupt onset, high fever, petechial rash or purpura. WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close contacts of the cases, such as persons sleeping in the same dwelling. In most countries rifampicin is recommended. In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next year, the Ministry of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries of Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive, that the vaccination against meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y and W135) has been added to the health requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj.

"(' Influenza A(H5N1) virus was recently detected in three retail live-bird markets in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, with increased mortality in the bird population noted in the last few days. No H5N1 viruses were isolated in other retail markets. No human cases of H5N1 virus have been detected. The strains isolated from the birds differ genetically from the H5N1 virus which caused human disease in 1997. There is no cause for public health concern, but as a precautionary measure, the birds at all three retail markets have been destroyed and the markets cleansed and disinfected. For further information, click on the website of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. The following is the transcript of the English portion of the opening remarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the Environment and Food, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press briefing held on May 16: Precautionary measures taken to prevent spread of chicken disease I have called this press briefing to announce that at 3.30 this afternoon the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation has issued a notice declaring the poultry stalls in three markets as infected places in accordance with the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The three markets are Yeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the Smithfield Road Market. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has already started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has requested all poultry stallholders to destroy the live birds in their stalls, and these stallholders will be given every assistance and advice by members of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The department has also made appropriate arrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent right away to a landfill for proper treatment. After all the birds have been destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. We have taken this precautionary measure for two reasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763 chickens have died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other two markets. Tests by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have demonstrated that these chickens have died of avian influenza. I have to emphasize that there are many strains of H5N1 and according to the information currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain that we had in Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of H5N1 strains will not affect human beings. From samples we have recently collected from these three markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus, and genes sequencing tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I repeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong Kong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is essential for us to take this precautionary measure because there is a need to destroy these viruses thoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the probability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they might - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain which may affect human beings. I have to reiterate there is no cause for public concern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is that there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of course, the public is reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards. The measures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the results, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough surveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the arrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this surveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they arise so that we can take the necessary measures. Thank you very much. ',)",0

"(' 05 September 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO 5 SEPTEMBER 2001 WHO LAUNCHES URGENT APPEAL FOR US$ 2.9 MILLION TO TACKLE YELLOW FEVER EPIDEMIC IN ABIDJAN Preparations Under Way to Send Desperately Needed Vaccine The World Health Organization (WHO) is today launching an urgent appeal for US $ 2.9 million to cover the cost of a mass immunization campaign in response to a potentially disastrous outbreak of yellow fever in Abidjan, the commercial capital of Côte d\'Ivoire. WHO is also preparing to deliver vaccine from an international stockpile to Abidjan as soon as possible. Cases of yellow fever have been confirmed in five of the ten communes in Abidjan; suspected cases have also been reported elsewhere. In all, 20 suspected cases have been notified in Abidjan, including four deaths; six of the cases have been confirmed and several others are under investigation. Surveillance data is by no means comprehensive and all indications are that the real situation could be considerably more serious than the number of cases officially suggests. There is also an incubation period of three to seven days before symptoms begin to appear. Urban Yellow Fever is spread by a variety of mosquito that lives in or very close to people\'s homes and, although very rare, can spread extremely rapidly among a dense urban population, causing many thousands of deaths. Rapid action is essential to purchase stocks of vaccine and deliver them to Abidjan as soon as possible, to prevent this worrying outbreak from becoming a humanitarian disaster. WHO has received an appeal for assistance from the government of the Republic of Côte d\'Ivoire, following confirmation of the first cases in Abidjan. The government has asked for WHO\'s assistance in mobilizing international funds to provide financial and technical aid. ""WHO is today appealing to the international community to provide urgent assistance in the purchase and supply of vaccine. WHO will support all the measures necessary to bring this potential human tragedy to a swift conclusion,"" said Dr David Heymann, WHO Executive Director for Communicable Diseases. A WHO Rapid Assessment Team is in Abidjan, working with the Ministry of Public Health to formulate a response to the outbreak. Plans are under way for a mass immunization campaign in Abidjan, requiring some three million doses of vaccine. WHO is urgently locating stocks of yellow fever vaccine that can be moved quickly to Côte d\'Ivoire. In Abidjan, immunization teams will have to be recruited, trained and provided with the necessary resources and logistic support for this huge but vital undertaking. There is a delay of 7-10 days from immunization until protective immunity develops. It is therefore crucial for this campaign to begin as soon as possible in order to protect the population from an epidemic. Yellow fever is endemic in some tropical areas of Africa and the Americas. However, it is most commonly found in jungle areas and spread only sporadically to humans entering the forest. When the virus spreads into urban areas with high population density, it immediately becomes a very serious public health risk. Yellow fever is difficult to recognize in its early stages, when it can easily be confused with malaria, typhoid or other causes of fever. However, a number of cases enter a second ""toxic phase"" of the disease, in which bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes and/or stomach. Approximately 20-50% of ""toxic"" cases die within 10-14 days. ""The international community must respond and respond quickly to this urgent appeal to prevent a catastrophic outbreak of yellow fever in Abidjan,"" added Dr Heymann.

Movements of populations both within the country and across borders due to the consequences of ongoing conflicts are expected to increase the incidence of the disease within the coming months. CL has been endemic in Afghanistan for several years, with foci of zoonotic (animal reservoir to man) transmission mainly in the northern provinces and with anthroponotic transmission (human to human) typically involving large cities. An emergency plan of action is being developed by WHO and other partners to control the situation by the end of 2003, at least in Kabul. Priority interventions include provision of impregnated bednets, early treatment of cases with first line drugs, recruitment and training of intervention teams, and health education.

"(' 28 June 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO * Relatively small investment by international community could prevent misery for 200,000 in Kabul alone * Displaced people and international staff most at risk * Largest single outbreak of the disease in the world AFGHANISTAN: WHO APPEALS FOR US$ 1.2 MILLION TO TACKLE LARGEST SINGLE EPIDEMIC OF DISFIGURING DISEASE Decades of civil war in Afghanistan have not only destroyed much of the country\'s infrastructure. Neglected but treatable diseases have taken hold throughout this long history of conflict and defeated the efforts of doctors and clinics to bring them under control. One of the most serious examples is a disfiguring disease known by various names including Kandahar sore (scientific name cutaneous leishmaniasis). This is a condition caused by a parasite transmitted by insect bites that leads to disfiguring facial injuries and long-term disability. As a result, those affected are often stigmatized. Women and children are particularly affected and in some cases women may be treated as outcasts by their communities. In some areas, the disease is so widespread that it is known as ""Little Sister"" because it is almost a part of the family. But in Kabul today there is an opportunity to bring it under control and end the suffering endured by so many people. Two hundred thousand people are believed to be infected with this parasite in Kabul alone. Due to their lower levels of resistance to the disease, returning refugees and other displaced persons in Kabul are at higher risk of infection. International staff working in Afghanistan also face a substantially higher risk. The World Health Organization, together with the government of Afghanistan and a number of international NGOs, is launching an urgent appeal for funds to bring this serious outbreak under control. This is one case where a remarkably small amount of money could make an enormous difference. ""A little over one million dollars is all we need to fund a two-year programme that would have a huge, long-term impact on this disfiguring disease once and for all,"" said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the WHO. ""But we need to act now: if this opportunity is missed, there will be a severe increase in the number of cases next year."" It is vital that this emergency response is launched as soon as possible. Because this form of leishmaniasis is passed from person to person via the bite of a sandfly, the infection can spread rapidly in a concentrated population, particularly among the poor. The sandflies breed quickly in unsanitary conditions. After biting an infected person, the sandflies spread the disease each time they bite. Transmission occurs from May to October, but new cases may not emerge for another several months because of the long incubation period of the disease. However, it is vital to interrupt transmission in order to avoid a sharp increase in the number of cases over the next year. A rapid response now also allows a long-term control plan to be put in place, to prevent this disease from taking an even stronger hold in Afghanistan. The WHO emergency plan involves a rapid intervention combining preventive and curative measures with drugs for mass treatment, insecticide impregnated bednets for individual protection, social mobilization, and health education to ensure that this disabling disease of poverty can be brought under control.

In Viet Nam the outbreak began with a single initial case who was hospitalized for treatment of severe, acute respiratory syndrome of unknown origin. He felt unwell during his journey and fell ill shortly after arrival in Hanoi from Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR, China. Following his admission to the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar symptoms. The signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore throat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings may include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white blood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral pneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering but some patients remain critically ill. Today, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an outbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight 11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were found to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for observation as a precautionary measure. In this group, eight have developed early chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. Three other health care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and two of them have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Investigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The Hospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the spread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between these cases and the outbreak in Hanoi. In mid February, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of atypical pneumonia, with five deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In two cases that died, chlamydia infection was found. Further investigations of the cause of the outbreak is ongoing. Overall the outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong SAR appear to be confined to the hospital environment.

Following his admission to the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar symptoms. The signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore throat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings may include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white blood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral pneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering but some patients remain critically ill. Today, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an outbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight 11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were found to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for observation as a precautionary measure. In this group, eight have developed early chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. Three other health care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and two of them have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Investigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The Hospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the spread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between these cases and the outbreak in Hanoi. In mid February, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of atypical pneumonia, with five deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In two cases that died, chlamydia infection was found. Further investigations of the cause of the outbreak is ongoing. Overall the outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong SAR appear to be confined to the hospital environment. Those at highest risk appear to be staff caring for the patients. No link has so far been made between these outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in Hanoi and Hong Kong and the outbreak of `bird flu,` A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR reported on 19 February. Further investigations continue and laboratory tests on specimens from Viet Nam and Hong Kong SAR are being studied by WHO collaborating centres in Japan and the United States. Until more is known about the cause of these outbreaks, WHO recommends patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be isolated with barrier nursing techniques. At the same time, WHO recommends that any suspect cases be reported to national health authorities. WHO is in close contact with relevant national authorities and has also offered epidemiological, laboratory and clinical support. WHO is working with national authorities to ensure appropriate investigation, reporting and containment of these outbreaks.

"(' 16 March 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported As of 15 March 2003, reports of over 150 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology, have been received by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 26 February 2003 ( see previous report ). WHO is co-ordinating the international investigation of this outbreak and is working closely with health authorities in the affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support as required. SARS was first recognised on the 26 February 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam. The causative agent has yet to be identified. The main symptoms and signs include high fever (>38 degrees C), cough, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties (see Case definitions for Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). A proportion of patients with SARS develop severe pneumonia; some of whom have needed ventilator support. As of 15 March, four deaths have been reported. As of 15 March the majority of cases have occurred in people who have had very close contact with other cases and over 90% of cases have occurred in health care workers. The mode of transmission and the causative agent have yet to be determined. Aerosol and/or droplet spread is possible as is transmission from body fluids. Respiratory isolation, strict respiratory and mucosal barrier nursing are recommended for cases. Cases should be treated as clinically indicated. (see below for further details). An epidemic of atypical pneumonia had previously been reported by the Chinese government starting in November 2002 in Guangdong Province. This epidemic is reported to be under control. Hanoi, Viet Nam On the 26 February 2003, a man (index case) was admitted to hospital in Hanoi with a high fever, dry cough, myalgia and mild sore throat. Over the next four days he developed increasing breathing difficulties, severe thrombocytopenia, and signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and required ventilator support. Despite intensive therapy he died on the 13 March after being transferred to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. On 5 March, seven health care workers who had cared for the index case also became ill (high fever, myalgia, headache and less often sore throat). The onset of illness ranged from 4 to 7 days after admission of the index case. As of 15 March, 43 cases have been reported in Viet Nam. At least five of these patients are currently requiring ventilator support. Two deaths have occurred. With the exception of one case (the son of a health care worker) all cases to date have had direct contact with the hospital where the index case had first received treatment. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China Influenza A(H5N1) reported in February On 12 March 2003, 20 health care workers developed influenza-like symptoms (high fever, headache and lower respiratory symptoms). Since then the number of reported cases has increased daily. As of 15 March, over 100 reported cases have been hospitalised, at least two of whom are receiving ventilatory support. One death (index case from Viet Nam) has been reported. Singapore On 13 March 2003, the Ministry of Health in Singapore reported three cases of SARS in people who had recently returned to Singapore after travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. As of 15 March 2003, 13 additional cases have been reported. All 13 of these cases have had very close contact with one or more of the initial three cases. All 16 cases are reported to be in a stable condition and are being cared for in isolation. Thailand As of 15 March 2003, one imported case has been reported in Thailand. The case (a health care worker) travelled to Thailand on the 11 March from Hanoi, Viet Nam. The case is known to have had close contact with the Hanoi index case and to have been unwell on arrival in Thailand. The case was immediately isolated on arrival in Thailand and reported to be in a stable condition and is being cared for in isolation. There is no evidence of transmission of SARS in Thailand. Canada As of 15 March 2003, seven cases have been reported in Canada; two of whom have died. The cases have occurred in two separate extended family clusters. In both clusters at least one member of the family had travelled to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China within a week of developing symptoms. Philippines and Indonesia Unconfirmed reports of a single case in the Philippines to date. However one close contact of the Hanoi index case is under observation in an isolation facility. This person is reported to be well. Unconfirmed reports of a single case in Indonesia were received on the 15 March. However further reports have confirmed that this person does not fulfill the case definition. As of 16 March, there are therefore no reported cases in Indonesia. New York, USA – Frankfurt, Germany On 15 March 2003, a health care worker from Singapore who was visiting New York boarded a flight from New York to Frankfurt. The health care worker was known to be unwell and to have had recent close contact with a reported case of SARS in Singapore. German health authorities were notified and the health care worker was transferred to an isolation unit in Frankfurt as soon as the flight landed. There is no evidence of transmission in Germany. Laboratory Investigation Various specimens have been collected from cases and post-mortum examinations. A wide range of laboratory tests have been conducted to date but no agent has been definitively identified. Laboratory investigations are continuing. International Response WHO is assisting affected countries in responding to the various outbreaks. Extensive epidemiological and clinical investigation are ongoing in all affected countries. WHO/Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network team of epidemiologists, case management, infection control experts and laboratory experts is assisting the Vietnamese health authorities. The following organisations are contributing personnel and materials to the Hanoi team: * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States * Centre of International Health, Australia * Epicentre * Institut National de Veille Sanitaire, France * Institut Pasteur, France and Viet Nam * Médecins Sans Frontières * National Health Service, Department of Health, United Kingdom * Robert Koch Institute, Germany * Central Field Epidemiology Group Smittskyddsinstitutet (SMI), Sweden Bilateral assistance has also been mobilised from France and Japan. WHO is providing epidemiological support to health authorities in Hong Kong. Travel Advice There is presently no recommendations to restrict travel to any destination. However, guidance has been issued by WHO and is available.

"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 19 March 2003 Preliminary findings suggest a viral cause Research teams at two laboratories, in Germany and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, have detected particles of a virus from the Paramyxoviridae family in samples taken from patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This is the first major step forward in efforts to pinpoint the causative agent. Previous tests conducted in a number of top laboratories failed to detect the presence of any known bacteria or viruses, including the influenza viruses, recognized as causes of pneumonia or respiratory symptoms, or known to be widespread in the most affected geographical areas. The failure of all previous efforts to detect the presence of bacteria and viruses known to cause respiratory disease strongly suggests that the causative agent may be a novel pathogen. Firm conclusions about the identity of the causative agent are premature. All teams have stressed that these are preliminary results only. Further studies are needed before it can be concluded, with confidence, that the causative agent has been identified. Collaborative efforts continue. All research teams are participants in the international multicentre SARS research project, linking together 11 leading laboratories, that was set up on Monday 17 March. Coordinated research is expected to expedite definitive identification of the causative agent. The detection of paramyxovirus particles in samples from infected patients is the first lead to a possible cause of SARS and will be extremely important in focusing ongoing research. Definitive identification of the causative agent will help physicians move from the current “hit-or-miss” approach to treatment to a more precise selection of drugs with a greater prospect of cure. Knowledge of the causative agent will also speed development of a diagnostic test and thus give physicians and national health authorities a powerful tool for the identification of cases. It will also reassure the many “worried well” now presenting at health facilities, and reduce the number of false alarms. Update on countries and cases As of Wednesday 19 March, a cumulative total of 264 suspected or probable cases and 9 deaths have been reported from 10 countries (Canada, China, Germany Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Viet Nam). Hong Kong SAR, Hanoi (Viet Nam), and Singapore continue to be the most affected areas. Full details are provided in tabular form. Awareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world. Surveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly detected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated according to the standard case definition. The Paramyxoviridae family Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family include many common, well-known agents associated with respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus, and childhood illnesses, including the viruses that cause mumps and measles. Some of these viruses are widespread, particularly during the winter season. Screening of specimens could therefore be expected to detect particles of these common viruses. At this point, it cannot be ruled out entirely that tests for the SARS agent are detecting such “background” viruses rather than the true causative agent. The Paramyxoviridae family also includes two recently recognized pathogens, Hendra virus and Nipah virus. These related viruses are unusual in the family in that they can infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a number of animal hosts, including humans. Most other viruses in the family tend to infect a single animal species only. Nipah virus first began to cause deaths in humans in Peninsular Malaysia in 1998 in persons in close contact with pigs. The outbreak caused 265 cases of human encephalitis, including 105 deaths. Two separate outbreaks of Hendra virus, associated with severe respiratory disease in horses, caused two human deaths in Australia in 1994 and 1995. No human-to-human transmission was documented in either outbreak. No treatment was available for cases caused by either of these two viruses. Human-to-human transmission did not occur. ',)",264
"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 20 March 2003 Investigation of causative agent gains momentum Highly specialized testing of specimens from patients ill with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) continues at top speed in top labs, expedited by electronic sharing of results. WHO is increasingly optimistic that conclusive identification of the causative agent can be announced soon. The development of a precise diagnostic test could follow quickly. Collaboration in the race to find the causative agent is taking place within the framework of a network of labs set up on Monday. Research is now focused on the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses. This family includes several well-known viruses, such as those causing mumps, measles and common respiratory ailments. It also includes a subfamily of viruses capable of infecting multiple animal species, including humans. This subfamily was implicated in the emergence during the 1990s of new and severe diseases in humans caused by Hendra and Nipah viruses. The virus jumped directly from animal hosts (horses and pigs) to humans. No person-to-person transmission was documented in outbreaks caused by either virus. New treatment network WHO has today established a cooperative network of clinicians for SARS diagnosis and treatment. The network brings together, via two daily teleconferences, clinicians in the most heavily affected Asian countries and in Europe and North America. Clinicians participate on the basis of either first-hand experience in the management of SARS cases or leading expertise in the diagnosis and management of unusual infectious diseases. Participants are pooling data on cases and sharing X-ray pictures. Chest X-rays are, at present, one of the main tools for distinguishing between suspected and probable cases. Treatment guidelines, including criteria for safe discharge of patients from hospitals, are also being established on the basis of shared experiences. Pending definitive identification of the causative agent, a combination of treatments are being tried to cure cases. WHO is providing support, in the form of protective equipment and supplies, to help the most heavily affected hospitals prevent further spread within hospital settings, where the overwhelming majority of new infections have occurred. If a paramyxovirus is confirmed to be the cause, WHO will be in a much better position to recommend a treatment. The antiviral drug, ribavirin, may be responsible for some degree of clinical improvement observed in critically ill patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. Intensive and good supportive care have also been associated with improved prospects of recovery. Update on cases and affected countries As of 20 March, 306 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from eleven countries. These figures represent an additional 42 cases and one death compared with the previous day. Increases were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong (23), Singapore (3), Taiwan, China (1), the United Kingdom (1), and Viet Nam (6). Switzerland, reporting 7 suspected cases, was added to the list. Possible cases in airline passengers and crew member ruled out Press reports have referred to 2 suspected cases of SARS, one in an airline crew member and a second in a passenger, travelling on separate flights from Hong Kong and Taipei to Viet Nam. Both suspected cases have been investigated and are now ruled out as cases of SARS. Index case in Hong Kong outbreak WHO has welcomed a report from the Hong Kong Department of Health, released yesterday, that may have identified the “index” case in the outbreak in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. In an outstanding example of detective work, epidemiologists have determined that 7 people who contracted SARS recently stayed in or visited the Metropole hotel in Kowloon last month. The 7 persons investigated include 3 visitors from Singapore, 2 from Canada, one China Mainland visitor, and a local Hong Kong resident. The investigation revealed that all 7 stayed in or visited the same floor of the hotel between 12 February and 2 March. The local Hong Kong resident is believed to be the index case, who subsequently infected other early cases in the outbreak. He had visited an acquaintance staying at the hotel from 15 to 23 February. The visitor from Mainland China, who became sick a week before staying at the hotel, is considered the original source of the infection. No further cases have been linked to the hotel. Absolute need for continued vigilance WHO is underscoring the need for continued vigilance. Experience with other emerging diseases makes it clear that, should the causative agent turn out to be a virus, the new disease could establish endemicity, especially in light of abundantly documented human-to-human transmission. The world must protect itself against the widespread establishment of another new infectious disease. WHO concern is now increasingly focused on preparation to assist vulnerable countries in the likely event that cases continue to spread. Up to now, all imported cases have occurred in countries well-equipped and well-prepared to institute WHO-recommended precautions, including isolation and barrier nursing practices, for preventing spread to others, whether health care workers or family members. In view of the rapid spread of this disease to new countries via exposed air travellers, any country with an international airport is potentially at risk. This focus on preparedness underscores the need for a concerted effort to defend global public health security. In an era of close interconnectedness and rapid air travel, an outbreak anywhere in the world is a potential threat to health everywhere. International collaboration – on the part of the medical and research communities, multinational teams in the field, and health authorities around the world – in the reporting, investigation, and management of this outbreak has been outstanding.

"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 21 March 2003 ### Major step forward towards development of diagnostic test A laboratory in a new network set up on Monday 17 March has today succeeded in growing, in cell culture, an infectious agent that might be the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This major step towards the development of a diagnostic test has occurred despite the failure, up to now, to pinpoint the exact identity of the causative agent. Researchers at the laboratory took serum samples from the blood of recovering SARS patients and a matching number of healthy volunteers in what is known as a “blinded” test. Serum from patients infected by a virus usually contains neutralizing antibodies that stop the growth of the virus – whatever its identity – when added to a cell culture in which the virus has been successfully grown. When the researchers added serum from SARS patients to the cell culture, virus growth was halted. Serum from uninfected healthy controls had no effect on the virus. “This is not just some light at the end of the tunnel,” said WHO virologist Dr Klaus Stöhr, who is coordinating the collaborative laboratory efforts. “This is a real ray of sunshine.” WHO cautions, however, that the number of patients in the test was small and more work needs to be done. The scientific community is excited by the news, which could be regarded as the first important step towards the development of a diagnostic test. The infectious agent resembles the morphology of a Paramyxovirus. Scientists cannot, however, be certain about the identity of the virus, which may indeed be a new Paramyxovirus or another virus with a similar morphology. The laboratory is one of 11 leading labs participating in an international multicentre research project. The project was set up by WHO on Monday to expedite identification of the causative agent – considered by several research groups to be a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses – and rapidly develop a diagnostic test. WHO team of experts travelling to China A WHO team of five infectious disease experts will be travelling over the weekend to China to support investigations there of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November. The multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health for epidemiological and laboratory support to aid ongoing investigation of the outbreak. The team will also assist in laboratory work that might lead to identification of the causative agent. The team includes experts in virology, laboratory techniques, epidemiological investigation, and the control of unusual infectious diseases. Team members, of American, Australian, British, and German nationality, have been drawn from institutes participating in the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. The outbreak in southern China is linked geographically and by timing to the current outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which first surfaced in Asia in mid-February and caused its first known death on 13 March. Cases of this new disease have now been detected in 13 countries on three continents. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, which as of today accounts for 203 of the 350 suspected or probable cases reported worldwide, remains the most severely affected area. Apart from searching for the causative agent, the WHO team is expected to help Chinese scientists determine whether the Guangdong outbreak included cases that fit the current definition of SARS. Conclusive identification of the causative agent, which is thought to be a virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, would greatly aid the investigation by Chinese scientists and the WHO team, which is expected to begin on Monday. Research on the identity of the SARS pathogen is progressing rapidly within a network of 11 leading laboratories set up by WHO earlier this week. WHO remains optimistic that a definitive announcement of the cause of SARS can be made soon. History of the Guangdong outbreak WHO was first officially informed of the outbreak on 11 February, when the Chinese Ministry of Health reported that 305 cases of acute respiratory syndrome of unknown cause had occurred in six municipalities in Guangdong Province in southern China. Five deaths were reported. Transmission of the disease was largely confined to health care workers (105 doctors, nurses, and other medical workers) and household contacts of patients. On 14 February, WHO was informed by the Chinese Ministry of Health that the outbreak was clinically consistent with atypical pneumonia. Reported symptoms included fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, and bouts of coughing. Patients had acute symptoms, included high fever, dry cough, muscle pain, and weakness, and required hospitalization. The Chinese authorities also provided information that cases had been detected in the province as far back as 16 November 2002. In mid-February, some Chinese experts concluded that the outbreak was caused by chlamydial organisms. Others speculated that a virus might be the cause. It is hoped that the WHO team can help authorities quickly resolve these and other outstanding questions about the Guangdong outbreak. Update on cases and affected countries As of 21 March, 350 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. These figures represent an additional 44 cases and two new countries compared with the previous day. The number of deaths remains unchanged. Countries reported their first suspected cases are Italy and the Republic of Ireland, each reporting one case. New cases were reported in Hong Kong (30), Singapore (5), Taiwan, China (2), Thailand (3), and the United States of America (2). New guidelines for health authorities WHO has today posted on its web site two documents to assist national authorities in the investigation and management of cases. The first gives a more complete, though still preliminary, clinical picture of SARS, pooled from findings provided by clinicians treating SARS patients in seven countries. It is anticipated that the clinical description will help health authorities recognize cases with greater precision. The second document provides advice, including recommended laboratory tests and radiological findings, that can guide the safe discharge and follow-up of convalescent cases. The policy advice aims to ensure that the release of recovered patients carries no risks for family members and other close contacts. Until more is known about the etiological agent, and the potential for continued carriage, WHO is recommending a cautious approach. ',)",350
"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 22 March 2003 ### SARS virus isolated, new diagnostic test producing reliable results A team of scientists in the department of microbiology, University of Hong Kong, has announced today success in culturing the viral agent that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Further progress in the development of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by the same team. Using a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from the lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with a professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor and the contact have died. Isolation of the virus now lays the solid foundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test. The Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the technique of neutralizing antibodies. In today’s experiments designed to determine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to detect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from eight SARS patients. The consistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably identifying cases of SARS infection. This “hand-made” test will now be further developed into a more sophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS is urgently needed to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for rapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the many “worried well” who are flooding health facilities as international concern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to increase. Many common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms of SARS in its early stage. With the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move forward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with known viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared among 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Monday 17 March by WHO. Exceptionally rapid progress Close collaboration, with findings shared daily in teleconferences and by email, has allowed advances that normally need months to take place in a matter of days. “This spectacular achievement is an example of what the world can do when the intellectual resources of nations around the world are focused on a single problem,” says Klaus Stöhr, a WHO virologist who is coordinating the global laboratory network. “Scientists who are by default academic competitors are now working virtually shoulder to shoulder. In less than a week, they have produced results which, in other circumstances, would likely have taken months or more. This rapid advance is fuelling the hope that SARS can and will be contained.” The virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be a member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian researchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which belongs to this family, may be the cause. The metapneumovirus was first discovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also included in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus was known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of pneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less severe than the SARS agent. At this point, it cannot be ruled out that an entirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the SARS outbreak. Identity of virus remains elusive WHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no means over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains elusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are producing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family. SARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February, that has sickened over 380 persons on three continents and caused severe pneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected countries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO web site. Today’s data indicate that the vast majority of reported cases continue to occur in health care workers, family members and close contacts of patients. Investigative team travelling to China A WHO team of five experts is now en route to China to investigate the possibility that an outbreak of a disease having similar symptoms and affecting similar groups – health care workers and close contacts of patients – may be linked to the current SARS outbreak. As of today, Hong Kong remains the most seriously affected area. Authorities there have reported a total of 222 cases in health care workers, medical students, and family members and hospital visitors who have been in close contact with patients. Of these, 217 have developed symptoms of pneumonia, and many are in serious condition. ',)",>380

"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 24 March 2003 ### Advice to travellers, situation update Travel advice Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a new disease in Asia in mid-February. Since then, more than 450 cases, with 17 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries on three continents. On 15 March, WHO issued an emergency travel advisory, based on information available at that time, and a preliminary case definition of SARS. The travel advisory was intended to alert national authorities and clinicians to potential cases of SARS and to urge travellers, including airline crew, with symptoms suggestive of SARS to seek medical attention. WHO continues to recommend, on the basis of currently available data, no travel restrictions to any destination. Guidance to governments, airlines, physicians and travellers issued on 15 March remains valid. WHO issues emergency travel advisory. Advice for health authorities and clinicians A more detailed clinical picture of SARS has been posted at the WHO Web site: Preliminary Clinical Description of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. WHO has further recommended that suspect cases be placed in isolation and managed using strict barrier nursing practices: Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Drawing on partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, WHO and its partner institutes and collaborating centres have placed field teams in Hanoi, Viet Nam, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan, China to assist health authorities. Last week, WHO flew 300 kilos of protective equipment and medical supplies to Hanoi. Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others. As of data available today, the vast majority of cases continue to occur in health care workers managing patients in hospital environments, and in the families and other close contacts of patients. Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March. Update on cases and countries affected Reports from health authorities in 13 countries, compiled today, indicate a cumulative total of 456 cases of SARS and 17 deaths. This compares with reports a week ago (17 March) of 150 cases in 7 countries.Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March. For most of the affected countries, cases reported today are for probable cases. Previous reports included both probable and suspected cases. As case definitions of SARS differ in some countries, the United States of America is today reporting 37 suspect cases under investigation. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area, reporting 260 cases and 10 deaths. Other severely affected areas included Singapore, with 65 cases and no deaths, and Vietnam, with 58 cases and 4 deaths. Canada has reported 11 cases and 3 deaths. Chest X-rays showing distinctive features of SARS are presently the main tool for distinguishing suspected from probable cases. A “hand-made” diagnostic test, developed by Hong Kong scientists, began producing reliable results on Saturday and will be made available to key laboratories in a matter of days. A more sophisticated test is expected to be available for widespread use in diagnosing SARS cases within weeks. Work towards the definitive identification of the causative agent, now strongly expected to be a virus of the Paramyxovirus or Coronavirus families, is continuing at breakneck speed. Researchers in a network of 11 leading laboratories, set up on Monday 17 March, exchange data on a restricted web site and compare virological and clinical information during daily teleconferences. A second network of clinicians was set up on 20 March to expedite work on diagnosis and treatment. WHO team of experts in China A WHO international team of experts in epidemiology, microbiology, virology, and respiratory diseases arrived in Beijing, China on Sunday 23 March. The multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health to investigate possible links between the current SARS outbreak, which began in Asia in mid-February, and an outbreak of atypical pneumonia which began in Guangdong Province in China in mid-November. The WHO team, which includes experts from 5 countries, will review available epidemiological and laboratory data on cases in the southern China outbreak. It will also propose what additional investigations should be carried out, and which additional reagents, antibodies, tests, equipment and expertise might be required to continue the laboratory and virological work. This additional expertise and equipment is expected to bolster efforts to trace the source of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. Concern over international spread The first concern WHO has regarding travel is the possibility that the disease will spread rapidly and become established in many countries around the world. The extent to which this is happening is being monitored by heightened surveillance for SARS symptoms around the world and rapid reporting of suspected cases. The worldwide awareness of the disease has been demonstrated by the number of countries reporting to WHO. Recommended isolation procedures appear to be working. Since these measures were introduced, no onward transmission of the disease, beyond those initially identified, has been reported. In these circumstances, where the rapid identification and isolation of cases appears to be containing international spread, WHO does not consider that any additional restrictions on travel or trade are required. Concerns over travel to affected areas As countries around the world have increased surveillance activities they have discovered a small number of cases in persons who have traveled to the affected areas. The small number of such cases, at present, is an indication that SARS poses little risk to travellers visiting the affected areas. Based on available information, WHO does not consider that the small health risk attributable to SARS significantly increases the health risk associated with travel to any destination. WHO therefore maintains its advice that no SARS-related restrictions on travel to any destination are necessary. WHO is aware that a number of countries have advised their nationals to consider postponing unnecessary or elective travel to the areas where local transmission of the disease has been demonstrated. Such advice does not amount to a restriction of travel, and is the responsibility of the concerned national authorities. Concern about air travel The public is also concerned about the safety of air travel. Cases that have been identified in countries outside the initially affected areas have arrived by air transport. It is important to note that there is no evidence to date to indicate that the disease is transmitted during air travel, or that travelling in an aeroplane with an infected person has resulted in illness to other passengers or crew. In case of concern that passengers have been exposed to an infected person during a flight, a protocol exists for the follow up of passengers and crew. When an airline wishes to disinfect an aeroplane after carrying a suspected SARS case there is good reason to believe that the procedures described in the WHO Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation will be fully effective.

"("" Disease Outbreak Reported 25 March 2003 ### Updated travel advice On 15 March, WHO issued a travel advisory in response to the growing international threat posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since then, WHO has conducted daily teleconferences with health authorities and WHO team members on the scene in all areas affected by SARS. WHO also receives detailed bulletins from ministries of health in the most heavily affected areas reporting on any SARS-related events that might alter understanding of the behaviour of this new disease. Today’s communications included a report, from the Hong Kong department of health, providing detailed preliminary data on the detection of nine atypical pneumonia cases among members of a Beijing tour organized by a Hong Kong travel agent. Investigation of these cases, including tentative identification of the index case, has progressed rapidly. The Hong Kong department of health is tracing, for surveillance purposes, the crew members and passengers who had taken two flights. The general public has been informed and a hot-line has been set up. WHO epidemiologists in Geneva, together with experts tracking outbreaks in affected countries, have decided today that, based on the information available at present, there is no need to change previous WHO advice. WHO continues to recommend no travel restrictions to any destination. WHO advises travellers to remain alert to the symptoms of SARS. These include high fever, respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing, and should report these symptoms promptly. As of today, 487 SARS cases have been reported from 12 countries. A number of persons with SARS have taken long distance flights after becoming ill. Thousands of passengers who travelled in the same flights have been traced in Germany, Canada, Singapore and the United States. No cases have been discovered among these contacts. Today's report of a possible transmission of SARS on board a flight is undergoing investigation. As “close” contact is possible during a flight, in passengers sitting close to an infected person, such transmission cannot be ruled out. The evidence to date indicates that in- flight transmission is very unusual. Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others. WHO advice to travellers is being kept under constant review. SARS is an emerging disease. Knowledge about is clinical behaviour, response to treatment, and modes and risks of transmission are continually evolving. WHO is confident that, in the present climate of heightened awareness and rapid and detailed reporting, data useful in understanding SARS and issuing sound public health advice are being rapidly collected and rapidly made available.

"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 26 March 2003 ### Data from China, countries introduce stringent control measures China updates data on cases and deaths Chinese authorities have today officially reported a total of 792 cases and 31 deaths in an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in southern China, in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002. Cases were reported to have occurred in 7 cities of Guangdong Province. Chinese authorities had previously reported to WHO, on 14 February, a total of 305 cases and 5 deaths from 16 November to 9 February 2003. The new figures cover the period of 16 November to 28 February. A WHO team of 5 international experts, which arrived in China on the weekend, has today reviewed the case definition used in reporting cases of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. The WHO team compared this definition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the two definitions are compatible. Following in-depth discussion with central-level authorities and health officials in Guangdong Province on the details of several clusters of cases, the WHO expert team reached the conclusion that the atypical pneumonia cases which began occurring in southern China in November 2002 are likely cases of the same disease, now referred to as SARS, that began appearing in other Asian countries on 26 February and has since spread widely to several cities throughout the world. Chinese authorities further informed the WHO team of a new reporting system that will rely on regular provincial updates. WHO is expecting further information on reported cases in China for March as these data become available. Case management guidelines being used in China are in line with WHO recommendations for minimizing further transmission. China is also beginning a collaborative programme in which sera from infected Chinese patients will be exchanged with the WHO network of collaborating laboratories who are working to identify the SARS causative agent. Update on reported cases The new data from China bring the total number of reported probable cases worldwide, dating back to 16 November, to 1323 cases and 49 deaths. When the data from China are excluded, today’s figures represent an increase of 41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and one death, in Singapore, compared with yesterday. Full details are available on the WHO web site.Cumulative Number of Reported Cases (SARS). National measures to contain further spread Several countries are introducing maximum measures, including quarantine, to prevent the further spread of SARS. New diseases such as SARS are poorly understood as they emerge. At the beginning of an outbreak, it is sound public health policy to institute maximum control measures needed to prevent further spread. Maximum measures are justified when, in the view of national health authorities, they can be expected to protect populations against infection, keep the disease from spreading into the general population, and help prevent international spread to other countries, particularly through air travel. As the epidemiology of SARS becomes more fully understood, such measures can be adjusted and reduced in line with what is known about how the disease is transmitted and what works best to stop its spread, both nationally and internationally. First clinical “grand rounds” on SARS held today The first global “grand rounds” on SARS clinical features and treatment were held today by WHO. The electronic meeting united 80 clinicians from 13 countries. A summary of their discussions and conclusions has been posted today at the WHO web site.Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients. Progress towards identification of the virus Research attention is increasingly focusing on the Coronavirus family, though viruses from the Paramyxovirus and other families are also being considered as scientists cast the widest possible net in their search for the cause of SARS. Many are of the opinion that a diagnostic test could rapidly follow conclusive identification of the pathogen. Experts in the network are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection with two new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe disease in humans. Evidence is strongly pointing to a new virus, or possibly two new viruses, that have not previously been known to infect humans or cause severe disease. Hypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that has jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus that has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe disease in humans. It is increasingly certain, however, that SARS is a serious new disease caused by a newly recognized pathogen. ',)",1323
"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 27 March 2003 ### SARS virus close to conclusive identification, new tests for rapid diagnosis ready soon On 17 March, WHO established a global network of leading laboratories to collaborate in the identification of the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Early on, labs in the network narrowed the search to members of the paramyxovirus and coronavirus families. Findings shared by network labs earlier this week began pointing, with increasing consistency, to coronaviruses. “Data from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the primary cause of the disease,” said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus Stöhr. “This virus is unlike any known human or animal member of this virus family. It is consistently found in specimens from SARS patients from many countries. It has been isolated in cell-culture. We are very close to knowing for sure.” Conclusive identification of a causative must meet all criteria in the so- called “Koch’s postulate.” The additional experiments needed to fulfil these criteria are currently under way at a laboratory in the Netherlands. Scientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 March, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the causative agent of SARS. The virus was detected in cell culture and by electron microscopy. The identity of the virus was not known at the time. Earlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the agent that causes SARS. Many labs of the WHO network have since been using molecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in specimens from patients in various countries. Rapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from SARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among participants in the laboratory. Hong Kong, with 367 patients, many of whom are in intensive care, and 10 deaths remains the most severely affected area. Sequencing of the virus is ongoing in four laboratories. Results will help classify the virus and refine molecular diagnostic tools. Results will also guide the development of specific interventions. At present, no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been consistently shown to improve prognosis in persons with SARS. Scientists in the network suspect that the virus will prove to be an entirely new, or until now undetected, member of the coronavirus family. Progress in the development of a diagnostic test Efforts to develop a reliable and easy to use diagnostic test are also moving forward quickly. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and Public Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO network, have devised a basic diagnostic test. In studies using confirmed SARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently positive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy controls. Further testing will begin tomorrow. The Hong Kong diagnostic test is a molecular test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Hong Kong scientists have also developed a diagnostic tool using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique. Validation of the test is being facilitated by gene sequences of the PCR primers electronically by laboratories collaborating in the network. The WHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available to labs in other countries throughout the world Over the next few days, samples from hundreds of confirmed and suspected SARS cases will be tested using these new diagnostic tools. In so doing, the tools will be further refined and streamlined to upgrade their capacity for daily screening of large numbers of samples. The PCR test is already showing good reliability in detecting SARS cases in the early days of infection. The IFA test is being used to detect infection in convalescent sera at about three weeks after infection begins. Together, the two tests should help to quickly and safely reassure the many patients the world over who are concerned about suspicious symptoms and yet may be suffering from common illnesses safely treated at home. Procedures of isolation and strict barrier nursing, recommended by WHO for the management of suspected SARS cases, have placed a heavy burden on health care services in several affected areas. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1408 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. Romania is reporting its first 3 probable cases today. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day. New data from China The Chinese Ministry of Health has today officially reported 792 cases and 31 deaths, up to 28 February, in Guangdong Province. Approximately 30% of these cases occurred in health workers. The Chinese Ministry of Health has further reported on SARS cases in other parts of China. In Beijing, 10 cases and 3 deaths have occurred as of 26 March. Two of these cases are in health workers. In the northern province of Shanxi, four cases, with no deaths, have occurred as of 26 March. Two cases are in health workers. ',)",1408
"(' ### China joins WHO collaborative network Disease Outbreak Reported 28 March 2003 At a press briefing held today in Beijing, the head of the WHO investigative team in China, John MacKenzie of Australia, announced several steps forward in the government’s commitment to join international efforts to contain a newly emerging infectious disease. (see Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing, Beijing, China) The WHO team of five experts arrived in Beijing last Sunday to investigate an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002. Experts have strongly suspected a link between the southern China outbreak and current cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that first surfaced in mid-February in Asia. The disease has since spread to 13 countries on three continents. The WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Health, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, and officials from Guangdong Province. In the initial stage of the investigation, the WHO team compared case definitions used in China with those used by WHO to identify SARS and concluded that most cases of atypical pneumonia reported in China from mid- November until 28 February were “indeed cases of SARS.” As reported by the WHO team, Chinese authorities have now agreed to join the WHO collaborative effort to contain the SARS outbreak and prevent its further international spread. Chinese institutes will be selected within days to participate in three global electronic networks set up by WHO to facilitate rapid international collaboration on SARS-related scientific and medical problems. Networks of experts are working to further identify and characterize the SARS virus, develop better tools for diagnosis and management, and understand how the disease is transmitted and what works best to prevent its spread. WHO authorities have also been given access to meticulous records kept on Chinese SARS cases. As China, according to statistics released earlier this week, has experienced the largest number of SARS cases of any country in the world, these data are expected to take understanding of the new disease, and particularly its origins, a major step forward. One of the greatest challenges in containing new diseases is the lack of understanding of their behaviour as they emerge. The Chinese data, which also cover the longest time frame, are further expected to improve understanding of how the disease spreads from person to person and why some outbreaks appear to have much milder cases than others. Progress in identifying the causative agent, now being reported by members in a WHO global network of collaborating laboratories, indicates that the causative agent is a new virus in humans that may have jumped the species barrier from its animal host or mutated in ways that have given it more lethal properties. Chinese data may help solve the riddle of how the new virus first began to cause disease in humans. China released new figures on the Guangdong outbreak on Wednesday, significantly increasing the global cumulative total. On Thursday, officials issued the first reports of cases and deaths in ongoing outbreaks in Beijing province and in the northern province of Shanxi. China has further agreed today to begin providing up-to-date electronic reports of SARS cases throughout China. These reports will be submitted electronically as official reports to WHO from the Ministry of Health. According to members of the WHO team in China, the government may need a few days to get the new nationwide system of daily electronic reports in operation. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 77 cases. No new deaths have occurred. No reports were received from China today due to the decision to introduce a new system of nationwide daily electronic reporting to WHO. With 58 new cases, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area. Other countries reporting new cases include Canada (1), China, Taiwan (4), Singapore (8), and the United States of America (6). Viet Nam reported no new cases and no new deaths for the fifth day in a row. WHO experts believe that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate introduction of stringent infection control procedures may have held further transmission at bay. Some patients recovering To date, 19 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals in Hong Kong, 17 from Viet Nam, and 25 from Singapore. ',)",1485
"(' ### Update on cases and countries Disease Outbreak Reported 29 March 2003 As of today, a cumulative total of 1550 cases and 54 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 65 cases and one death compared with the previous day. WHO infectious disease specialist, Dr Carlo Urbani, the first WHO officer to identify the outbreak of this new disease and treat the earliest cases in Hanoi, died of SARS today in Thailand, accounting for the additional death. The number of cases in Viet Nam remained at 58 for the sixth day in a row, indicating that the outbreak in Hanoi is well-controlled. The largest increases occurred in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, with 45 new cases, and Canada, with 8 new cases. The United States of America reported 8 additional suspect or probable cases. ',)",1550
"(' Disease Outbreak Reported 31 March 2003 ### Situation in Hong Kong, activities of WHO team in China Situation in Hong Kong The Hong Kong Department of Health has today issued an unprecedented isolation order to prevent the further spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The isolation order requires residents of Block E of Amoy Garden to remain in their flats until midnight on 9 April. The decision to issue the isolation order was made following a continued steep rise in the number of SARS cases detected in the building over the past few days. Concern about a possible outbreak in Amoy Garden mounted on Saturday, when 22 of Hong Kong’s 45 new SAR cases hospitalized that day were determined to be residents of the estate. On Sunday, 36 of the 60 new patients admitted to hospital with probable SARS were Amoy Garden residents. Hong Kong health authorities today informed the public that a cumulative total of 213 residents of Amoy Garden had been admitted to hospital with suspected SARS since reporting on the disease began. Hong Kong’s outbreak began on 12 March when health officials first recognized a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Of the 213 Amoy residents affected in the outbreak, 107 patients resided in Block E. In addition, most of these 107 patients from Block E lived in flats that were vertically arranged. This suggests that SARS may be spreading in Hong Kong according to a different pattern, still involving close person-to-person contact with bodily secretions from an infected person. WHO epidemiologists are considering the possibility that bodily secretions containing the causative virus might somehow enter common systems that link rooms or flats together. This pattern of spread would be in addition to the well-documented face-to-face contact that has been seen in the majority of cases reported so far. Earlier this month, Hong Kong epidemiologists detected an unusual pattern of transmission among guests and visitors at the Metropole Hotel during the critical period of 15 to 23 February. Guests and visitors at a single floor of the hotel are thought to have spread SARS to Toronto and Singapore and to have started the outbreak in Hong Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital. No staff at the hotel developed symptoms. Amoy Garden is a large housing estate consisting of ten 35-storey blocks, where around 15,000 persons reside. It is located in Kowloon District. WHO has been informed that environmental samples have been taken from the affected flats in Block E and that investigations are under way to determine a possible explanation for this apparent vertical spread of the disease. Although the investigation is complex, results from testing of the environmental samples should be available within days and will help determine the source of infection in Block E and the mechanisms by which the pathogen has spread. Hong Kong epidemiologists have identified a possible “index” case in the Amoy Garden outbreak. This is a patient, now hospitalized in Prince of Wales Hospital, who visited his brother, a resident of Block E, several times before hospital admission. The WHO team in China The expert team spent the day in the Beijing Municipality Center for Disease Control and Prevention reviewing case records for all 10 cases reported in Beijing Municipality. Following the cases in Guangdong province in late January and early February 2003, Beijing Municipality CDC officials said an enhanced local surveillance system was established by adding 11 sentinel hospitals (out of 50 total hospitals) to report cases of atypical pneumonia. The laboratory service was also geared up to receive specimens and carry out tests in secure conditions. Other preparation included stockpiling of drugs, setting up a public hotline and holding two news conferences. In addition, CDC and hospital staff were trained in prompt reporting of atypical pneumonia and infection control. An isolation unit was established. CDC Beijing said that antibiotics and Ribovirin are being used routinely as treatment and prophylaxis. The team were told that contact tracing had begun as soon as the first cases of atypical pneumonia had been recognized in Beijing and had been carried out for all subsequent cases. Eight of the cases were imported (from Hong Kong and Taiyuan city, Shanxi province) and two were health care workers who became infected trying to revive a 72 year old man believed to have become ill after visiting a relative with SARS in a Hong Kong hospital. Besides the two health care workers, no other cases have been infected in Beijing. Discussions concerning a visit by the expert team to Guangdong Province are continuing with the Ministry of Health. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1622 cases, with 58 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 72 cases and 4 deaths since the last figures were compiled on Saturday. The greatest increase in cases occurred in Hong Kong SAR. The additional deaths were reported in Canada (1) and Hong Kong (3). Germany reported its fifth case, and Switzerland its third. ',)",1622
"(' ### Update on cases and countries Disease Outbreak Reported 1 April 2003 As of today, a cumulative total of 1804 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 62 deaths have been reported from 15 countries. This represents an increase of 182 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day. The largest increase occurred in Hong Kong, where 155 new cases were reported. This brings the cumulative total of cases in Hong Kong to 685 cases with 16 deaths. Of the four new SARS deaths, three occurred in Hong Kong. The fourth death was reported in Singapore. China remains the country with the largest number of cases. According to official reports, 806 cases with 34 deaths have occurred. The majority of these cases and deaths were associated with an outbreak in Guangdong Province. During that outbreak, authorities recorded 792 cases and 31 deaths from 16 November 2002 through 28 February. Other countries reporting additional cases include Canada (9), Taiwan, China (3), Italy (1) Singapore (1), Thailand (1), and the United States of America (10). Australia and Belgium reported their first probable cases today. In Viet Nam, where hospitals in Hanoi were among the earliest to experience a rapid burst of cases within a health care setting, the number of cases (58) and deaths (4) remained stable for the eighth day in a row. The incubation period for SARS is currently believed to range from two to 10 days. WHO epidemiologists regard an eight-day period with no newly detected cases as an encouraging sign that the outbreak in Hanoi has been controlled and that no further spread is occurring beyond the initial hospital foci. Singapore, another country that was hard hit at the beginning of the epidemic, is likewise showing a stable pattern, with cases confined to well-documented risk groups and few new cases being detected. An evolving epidemic SARS is a newly identified disease with transmission patterns that are only beginning to emerge and thus difficult to interpret. Much about the disease remains poorly understood, despite great progress in characterization of the causative virus and development of a robust diagnostic test. Particularly puzzling are the great differences between areas where outbreaks appear to have been fairly rapidly contained and confined to health care settings and persons in close face-to-face contact with patients, and other areas, such as Hong Kong and Toronto, where transmission is continuing despite the prompt isolation of patients and introduction of strict barrier nursing practices. WHO has established a set of priority issues requiring urgent scientific investigation. More studies are needed about how the disease is spread, the stages of the disease when virus is shed, which bodily secretions carry the virus, and whether certain secretions are more infectious than others. Researchers also need to understand whether persons infected with SARS become more infectious at a certain stage in the course of the disease, and whether factors such as age or underlying disease influence severity and prognosis. Some of the world’s foremost scientists and clinicians are now collaborating around the clock, through three WHO networks of “virtual” labs and clinics, to find answers to these questions. Evidence can then form the basis for more precise public health advice on how to prevent further spread both internationally and within those countries where cases have occurred. Based on more than five decades of experience, WHO maintains the position that good surveillance and response will contain any infectious diseases. ',)",1804
"(' ### China deepens its collaboration to contain SARS, WHO revises its advice to international travellers as new data come in 2 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported New data from China, WHO team leaving immediately for Guangdong Chinese authorities have today announced updated figures for the number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and deaths in Guangdong Province. The figures, which cover the reporting period of 1 March to 31 March, are 361 new SARS cases and 9 deaths. Chinese authorities had previously reported 792 cases and 31 deaths in Guangdong Province in the reporting period of 16 November 2002 to 28 February 2003. The cumulative total of SARS cases in Guangdong from 16 November to 31 March now stands at 1153 cases and 40 deaths. The Chinese Ministry of Health has further announced that a five-person WHO team will be travelling immediately to Guangdong Province to confer with officials there. Chinese experience with the oldest SARS outbreak is expected to yield epidemiological and clinical clues useful in establishing policies to contain outbreaks elsewhere and prevent further international spread. Many questions about the outbreak in Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong, have yet to be answered. This outbreak is the largest reported to date and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community. No transmission of new cases is being reported elsewhere in the country. Chinese authorities are in the process of setting up a reporting system that will result in daily real-time reporting of SAS cases throughout the country. New advice to travellers On the basis of new data from China and Hong Kong, WHO has today revised its advice to international travellers as a measure for preventing the further international spread of SARS. In a press release this morning, WHO issued the following advice: “The World Health Organization (WHO) today began recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments in the multi-country outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).” The new travel advice is intended to limit further international spread of SARS by restricting travel to areas where the transmission patterns of SARS are not fully understood. The SARS situation, which is rapidly evolving, is under constant assessment by WHO in collaboration with three global networks of experts. The new advice is issued as part of a series of measures that will change as more information about SARS becomes available. New data on international spread Overnight, WHO received reports on 9 persons, with a history of travel to Hong Kong dating from 15 March, who subsequently developed symptoms suggesting probable cases of SARS when they travelled to other countries. These 9 cases of probable SARS, related to travel in Hong Kong, occurred in Taiwan, Province of China, and Singapore. The data on these cases, and what is known about the incubation period of SARS, indicate that travel to Hong Kong can contribute to the international spread of SARS. 15 March is the date when WHO issued its first SARS-related emergency travel advisory, which increased global awareness of this new disease, made travellers and health staff alert to symptoms, and initiated prompt reporting of cases. The SARS outbreak in Hong Kong SAR has developed an unusual pattern of transmission. This pattern is different from what is being seen in the vast majority of other SARS outbreaks, and is not yet fully understood. The number of cases is continuing to increase significantly, and there is evidence that the disease has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These developments raise questions related to other routes of transmission, in addition to well-documented face-to-face exposure to droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Epidemiologists are considering whether SARS is being transmitted in Hong Kong by some environmental means for which no satisfactory explanation has been found. Particular concern centres on a large cluster of cases linked to residential buildings in the Amoy Garden housing estate in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong. Historical perspective This is the first time in the history of WHO that such travel advice has been issued for specific geographical areas because of an outbreak of an infectious disease. Since 1958, WHO has issued weekly lists of areas infected with quarantinable diseases so that national authorities can decide whether to apply public health measures to arriving travellers. During the last years of the smallpox eradication campaign cases spread internationally by land. Controls at borders between neighbouring countries were relied on to prevent international spread. No global recommendations were necessary. ',)",1153

"(' 3 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported ### Situation in China and Hong Kong SAR WHO team arrives in Guangdong Province The WHO team of experts arrived in Guangdong Province, China today and immediately started its work. The team was authorized to travel to the province yesterday. Meetings were held today with senior provincial health officials. The WHO team also listened to reports about the SARS outbreak, and held initial meetings with health workers at all levels. These workers, who have first-hand knowledge of the outbreak, include epidemiologists and clinicians treating SARS patients. Discussion focused on patterns of transmission, clinical profiles, and the suspected causative agent. Chinese authorities had previously reported a cumulative total of 1153 cases and 40 deaths in Guangdong Province from 16 November, when the outbreak began, to the end of March, making this province the area most seriously affected by SARS to date. The world’s first recognized case of SARS occurred in Guangdong Province on 16 November. Expectations are high that important clues will emerge concerning the origins of SARS, which is thought to be caused by a new virus in the coronavirus family. The exact identity of the virus has proved elusive. Scientists, who confer daily in teleconferences organized by WHO, currently speculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an animal species or mutated into a more virulent form. In its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan city, where the first case of SARS was reported, and Guangzhou city. The team will also visit health care facilities, review case records, and hold further discussions before returning to Beijing early next week. In Beijing, the government of China is now gearing up to fight SARS on a priority basis. Reports in today’s media referred to a State Council executive meeting on SARS and described three key decisions. * A special task force, headed by Minister of Health Dr Zhang Wenkang, will take charge of the fight against SARS. A vice secretary-general of the State Council will coordinate actions by relevant ministries. * The task force will provide updates on SARS to WHO. * A nationwide mechanism for outbreak alert and response will be set up shortly to ensure rapid detection and reporting of outbreaks. Dr Zhang appeared on Chinese national TV to address SARS-related issues. Situation in Hong Kong SAR The Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR reported 26 new cases today, compared with 23 yesterday. These figures represent a significant decline from the 155 cases reported on Tuesday and 60 reported on Monday. This trend suggests that the extraordinary control measures undertaken by the government are working. The Department of Health further announced that 89 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2270 SARS cases and 79 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 47 cases and 1 death (in Hong Kong) compared with yesterday. With the addition of the first probable case in Brazil, SARS is now being reported on four continents. New cases were reported in Canada (4), Hong Kong (26), Taiwan, China (1), France (2), Singapore (3), the United States of America (13), and Viet Nam (1). Brazil reported their first probable case.

For 2 April, 10 cases, with 1 death were reported in Guangdong Province, 2 cases and no deaths in Shanxi Province, and 1 case and 1 death in Hunan Province. The new data increase the cumulative number of cases in China, up to 2 April, from 1190 to 1220 cases, and from 46 to 49 deaths. Today’s table showing cumulative cases and deaths for all countries reporting suspected cases is being updated to reflect the new figures. Update on cases and countries As of today and including the new data from China, a cumulative total of 2353 SARS cases and 84 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 83 cases and 5 deaths compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Canada (1), China (3), and Singapore (1). New cases were reported in Canada (7), China (30), Hong Kong SAR (27), Taiwan, China (1), Singapore (2), and the United States of America (15). Situation in Hong Kong SAR The Department of Health has reported that 27 additional patients with symptoms of atypical pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals today. The new patients include five health care workers and eight residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The remaining 14 were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia. Of the 26 new patients reported yesterday, two were health care workers, two were residents of Amoy Gardens, and 22 were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia. Health authorities are current investigating sewage samples at a construction site adjacent to Block E apartment building in Amoy Gardens, which has been the source of a large cluster of new SARS cases. New cases have been associated with vertically linked apartments. A second line of investigation is concentrating on a burst sewage pipe in block E that may have epidemiological links with a visitor to Amoy Gardens which was subsequently admitted to Hong Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital in early March and was said to have been symptomatic at the time of his visit.

"(' ### Status of the main SARS outbreaks in different countries 7 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported China The Chinese Ministry of Health is now providing daily updates on numbers of cases and deaths, nationwide by province. On 3 April, a total of 17 new cases, including two deaths, were reported. Two previously reported cases were excluded. Eleven new cases and one death occurred in Guangdong Province. One case was reported from Shanghai, four from Beijing, and one case (fatal) from Sichuan Province. On April 4, 12 new cases, with no deaths, were reported, 11 from Guangdong and 1 from Shanxi. For April 5 and 6, 21 new cases and 2 new deaths were reported. The breakdown by province is awaiting translation from Chinese. This brings the total number of reported cases in China to 1268, with 53 deaths. Chinese officials have announced that SARS is being made a high priority for the government. A system of alert and response for early detection and reporting of all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being put in place. The government has also begun holding daily press conferences. WHO welcomes this move, which is an important way to increase awareness of the population and health care staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control. The WHO office in China has reported considerable anxiety among the international community following the death in Beijing on Sunday of a 53-year- old Finnish staff member of the International Labor Organization. The ILO staff members was in Beijing to attend an international conference. At present it is unclear how the staff member contracted SARS. He had travelled to Beijing via Thailand, where no local transmission has been reported. Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR continues to report the largest number of new cases, placing some hospitals under considerable strain. Today’s report from the Department of Health indicates that the unusual outbreak among residents in the Amoy Gardens estate, which has caused 268 cases, is coming to an end. Investigation of environmental samples continues at a rapid pace with support from several government departments. Evidence that the causative agent is excreted in faeces has focused attention on the possibility of an oral-faecal route of transmission, though no conclusions have been reached. Good data from the investigations are expected by the end of the week. The investigations have found no evidence of airborne spread. Singapore The Singapore Ministry of Health has reported an unusual cluster of 29 suspected SARS cases in hospital staff from two wards of a single hospital. Of these 4 are probable SARS cases. The onset of the clustering is believed to be 29 March. Officials investigating the cause of the outbreak are considering a possible point source in the environment, as it would be unusual for so many cases to begin on the same day if caused by contact with a patient Viet Nam The outbreak in Viet Nam began at a French hospital in Hanoi, where the index case, a 48-year old Chinese-American businessman who worked for an import- export company in Hong Kong, was admitted on 26 February. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 10 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam’s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors could have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases have been reported over the past two days. Canada Health Canada has received reports of 217 probable or suspect cases of SARS. There have been 9 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The largest outbreak has occurred in Ontario, where 87 probable and 92 suspect cases have been reported. British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases, New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases, Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case, Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases, and Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. These reports account for the 90 probable cases included in the WHO cumulative table of cases and deaths for today. Status of diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test, which is being pursued around the clock by the WHO collaborating network of 11 laboratories, has proved more problematic than hoped. Three diagnostic tests are now available and all have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control. The ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others. The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a demanding and comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture. The presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives, meaning that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected – creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 9 deaths compared with the last update of 5 April. The deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (4), and Hong Kong SAR (3). The single case reported in Belgium has been removed from the list. ',)",2601
"(' ### WHO Guangdong China team to issue its report 8 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported The WHO expert team in Guangdong Province, China will be issuing its official interim report and recommendations on the local SARS situation early tomorrow. The four-person team, headed by John MacKenzie of Australia, has been in Guangdong since Thursday 3 April. The team was charged to assess the local situation and to support the strengthening of surveillance, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of SARS cases. The team has visited Foshan City, where the earliest case is thought to have occurred in mid-November 2002, and Guangzhou City, the provincial capital. In a wide ranging collaborative investigation, the team has met with authorities, health and veterinary professionals, and technical experts in the provincial Centers for Disease Control laboratories and the virology laboratories of Zongshan Medical University. The team has conferred with staff at all levels and been granted full access to all sites, institutes, and hospitals requested. The team will be reporting on the provincial surveillance system, measures for community infection control, patient management and hospital infection control. It will also give a detailed review of microbiological findings. The SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province is presently the largest and oldest known outbreak of SARS and may hold important clues about both the origins or the virus and measures for clinical management. In one of its earliest reports about cases of atypical pneumonia to WHO, the Chinese Ministry of Health reported 305 cases and 5 deaths, from mid-November to 9 February, in 6 municipalities: Foshan, Guangzhou, Heyuan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan. Guangzhou was the home of a 64-year old professor of nephrology, at Zhongshan University, who is thought to be the index case who sparked the outbreak in Hong Kong. During late February, he stayed in room 911 on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Guests staying on the hotel’s ninth floor sparked outbreaks in other countries when they returned to their homes in Toronto and Singapore. A 48-year-old American businessman, who also stayed on the 9th floor, is believed to have originated the outbreaks in Hanoi and in Hong Kong’s Princess Margaret Hotel, where he was transferred. One local Hong Kong resident, who visited an acquaintance on the ninth floor, subsequently sparked an outbreak in a second Hong Kong hospital. Elsewhere in China, Shanghai, which has reported its first SARS case, has requested a visit from the WHO team to discuss SARS and be advised on how best to deal with the disease. In Beijing, the death on Sunday of a 53-year-old staff member of the International Labour Organization continued to cause considerable anxiety, particularly at embassies and among staff of international organizations. Epidemiologists at the WHO Office in Beijing have conducted contact tracing and other investigations to determine the source of the staff member’s exposure and to assess whether close contacts may have been exposed. To date, no SARS cases or suspicious symptoms related to this death have been observed. The investigations are continuing. Update on cases and countries As of today, 2671 SARS cases with 103 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 5 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Singapore (2). The additional cases were reported in Canada (1), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (45), France (1), Singapore (7), and the United States (7). Taiwan, China removed 2 cases from the list. ',)",2671
"(' ### Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main SARS outbreaks in different countries 9 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported China The WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and Vice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in Guangdong on 3 April. The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at every level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore concluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a hospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported. However, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the countryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further concerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a particular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the adequacy of contact tracing. In addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of other provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in Guangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS. In Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of SARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not appear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact tracing will allow the disease to spread. The team observed that many of China’s poorer provinces may not have adequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of SARS, and underscored that Guangdong’s capacity was exceptional among China’s provinces. In Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health care system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily during the second week of February. The team noted that the response of the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication and bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals. Microbiological findings Large banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases, from case contacts as well as from “normal controls” exist at the institutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed information about the numbers and types of these specimens are available and were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on each of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the very detailed epidemiological and clinical informations held elsewhere in Guangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals. These specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from which the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as paired acute and convalescent sera (i.e. the first sample obtained during the acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery) which will allow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that once a causative agent for SARS was identified these banks should be tested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however, less sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was already sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed elsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested assistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer sequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental tests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays. Main recommendations The interim report made several major recommendations, including the following: \\- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model that all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures that all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing this system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for evaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by technical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent standards are achieved and maintained. \\- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards throughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care facilities. \\- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak under control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by trained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but potential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport needs to be routinely carried out Contacts of cases should be provided with detailed preventive advice verbally and in writing. \\- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is required, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens and reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a national SARS laboratory network within China: · National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing · Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing · Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou · Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou Laboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be included. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided to ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance activities as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease. Chinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within China to speed up the exchange of results, specimens and reagents. \\- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the world and their experience should be shared with the international community through publications, meetings and in drafting guidelines for the management of SARS patients. Priority actions Priority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include: \\- early recognition and treatment of cases \\- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics \\- prompt reporting of suspected cases \\- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public awareness campaigns and education. Hong Kong: heavy burden on the health system With today’s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong continues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on health services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of infection control may be needed. The isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at midnight, April 9. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that residents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats have been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. Singapore: role of “super-spreaders” Singapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals following an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include mandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and isolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital outbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses and doctors. Only seven have been diagnosed as “probable” SARS cases. The distribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker considered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth “super-spreader” identified in Singapore. A “super-spreader” is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS remain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such “super-spreaders” may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks around the world. Until recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links to their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links for the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show that transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic, and usually very ill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers continue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation of the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community spread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients. However, these findings are based on limited data on exposures. Viet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission Vietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. Four of these cases have been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58 cases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope that the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained. However, a 59th case was reported on 31 March. This male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient at the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam’s index case. This contact continued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter’s husband, who attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile illness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously. It is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his father-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists maintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur. Nor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently assumed (2–7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is being taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for case 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi. Cases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who provided considerable care for case 59. WHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the contacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will be linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues. Of the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died and 14 remain in hospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although slightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving. Canada: one new probable case reported Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10 deaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in British Columbia (3). Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. New cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42), Singapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case reported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported in Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1). ',)",2722
"(' ### Status of SARS outbreaks in individual countries 10 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported China WHO is now planning to deepen discussions with health authorities in Beijing. This action follows concerns, connected with yesterday’s report from a WHO investigative team, about SARS cases in Beijing and systems of case reporting and contact tracing. China is today reporting 10 new SARS cases, with 2 new deaths, compared with yesterday. In a separate development, two laboratories in China have announced detection of a coronavirus in specimens taken from SARS patients. The new virus, which is unlike any known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family, was isolated by a WHO virtual network of 11 laboratories set up to expedite identification of the etiological agent and development of a diagnostic test. Detection of the coronavirus adds further evidence that the outbreak that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November 2002 was caused by the SARS virus. Hong Kong Health authorities in Hong Kong have today announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. The new measure is intended to facilitate early detection and treatment of SARS cases and to reduce to the absolute minimum the risk of further spread. With a cumulative total of 998 cases and 28 deaths, Hong Kong ranks just below China in the severity of the SARS outbreak. Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds. During the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks. Officials in the Department of Health estimate that an initial 70 to 80 households, representing around 150 persons, will be subject to the new requirement. In a separate development, ongoing investigations of the source of infection in the unusual cluster of cases in Amoy Gardens have failed to detect the virus in animals. The findings refute previous hypotheses that the SARS might have been spread by cockroaches or rodents, possibly through some common system serving vertically connected flats. Most Amoy Gardens cases have been residents in a single wing of a single building, Block E. Singapore In Singapore, particular concern has centered on a cluster of suspect and probable SARS cases first noted on 5 April in 21 staff at the Singapore General Hospital. Intensive investigation by WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials have traced most cases to a single Chinese man in his 60s was had been treated for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at another hospital (Tan Tock Hospital) from 5 to 20 March. The hospital subsequently experienced a cluster of 19 probable and 33 suspected SARS cases in staff, visitors, and inpatients. Most have been linked to the Chinese patient. The second hospital-related cluster of SARS cases has now been linked to a decision to transfer all patients at Singapore General Hospital to two wards at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is strongly suspected that the second cluster arose from contact with the Chinese patient. The investigation is providing some reassurance about the cause of these cases, which increasingly appear to fit the known pattern of exposure during close contact with patients. Viet Nam The number of cases in Viet Nam remains stable at 62. WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials anticipate that additional cases, associated with a case in a provincial hospital, may emerge in the next few days. However, vigilance is high, contact tracing is intense, and good infection control procedures are in place. Canada Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 97 cases, with 10 deaths. The represents an increase of only 3 new cases for the second consecutive day. Ontario has reported 94 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. British Columbia has reported 3 probable cases. Malaysia: history of third probable case WHO staff are collaborating with health authorities in Malaysia to conduct in- depth investigations, including history of recent travel and visits to health facilities, of the country’s three probable SARS cases in an effort to prevent a wider outbreak. Two new cases were reported today. Investigation of the country’s third case has revealed a history of travel to Beijing, China and Bangkok, Thailand. Onset of illness occurred in Bangkok. Upon return to Penang, Malaysia, the patient visited two private hospitals over a two-day period. Possible contacts are now being traced. Active contact tracing is a sound and essential public health measure for detecting persons who may have been exposed and alerting them to the steps to take should symptoms develop. Contact tracing can also establish whether all probable patients and suspect cases are linked together, through close face- to-face contact, and thus determine whether any instance of secondary transmission in the general community has occurred. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2781 cases and 111 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. Increases occurred in Brazil (1), Canada (3), China (10), Hong Kong SAR (28), Germany (1), Malaysia (2), Singapore (8), and the United States (5). Deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong SAR (3). ',)",2781
"As of 10 April 2003, the global SARS outbreak has affected 2781 cases and 111 deaths in 17 countries on three continents. The outbreak is particularly serious due to its rapid spread along international air travel routes and its ability to spread easily in close person-to-person contact. The disease has features that allow it to spread rapidly, including a high awareness of symptoms and exposures, and a lack of knowledge about the exact identity of the causative virus. Outbreaks in China, Canada, Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore have taken root in hospitals and beyond, causing concern due to the rapid spread in hospitals and the infection of a large number of previously healthy health care workers. In Hong Kong, the largest number of cases has been linked to the Amoy Gardens estate, where the disease has moved out of the health care setting and is now occurring within the community as secondary cases. The situation in Beijing is also a cause for concern. The best scientists from around the world are working on the research front, and progress has been unprecedented, particularly in the rapid discovery of a new coronavirus and the development of diagnostic tests. However, limitations in the tests currently available mean that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected. The SARS response is the roll out of a global alert and response activity under the revision of the International Health Regulations, which provide the legal framework for the surveillance and reporting of infectious disease and for the use of measures to prevent their international spread. Lessons for the immediate future, based on strengths and weaknesses of the global response, are of great importance, particularly for other highly significant infectious disease events, including the next influenza pandemic, the next emerging infection, and the deliberate release of a biological agent in an act of warfare or terrorism. In March 2003, a new disease, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), emerged in Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Canada. The disease was characterized by non-specific symptoms, a high concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff, and a mortality rate ranging from 53% to 88%. The outbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health workers and their family members, and many patients rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, requiring intensive care and causing some deaths in previously healthy persons. The etiology of the disease was not yet known, and transmission patterns were not characteristic for influenza. On March 15, 2003, WHO issued a rare emergency travel advisory as a global alert to international travellers, health care professionals, and health authorities. The global alert called for increased attention to patients with atypical pneumonia who fit the case definition and recommended no change in patterns of international travel. However, by March 27, international spread of SARS had continued, and persons on the same aeroplanes as persons with symptoms compatible with SARS had developed signs and symptoms compatible with SARS. On April 2, 2003, WHO recommended voluntary postponement of all but essential travel for travellers considering travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong due to the ongoing outbreaks in these areas. The knowledge obtained in the three-week period since March 15, 2003, demonstrated the value of international cooperation on emerging infections and the importance of early detection and rapid introduction of emergency measures to prevent further international spread. A network of 11 leading laboratories around the world was set up to expedite identification of the SARS causative agent, and collaboration among laboratories, epidemiologists, and clinicians resulted in the identification of the suspected causative agent and the development of diagnostic tests with unprecedented speed. However, key questions remain, including the exact points during the course of incubation and infection when transmission occurs and whether asymptomatic cases are also capable of spreading SARS. efficacy of treatment with specific antibiotics and antivirals, and has begun to develop systematic clinical trials of Ribaviran at two sites. Their discussions have shed light on features of the disease at presentation, treatment and progression of the disease, prognostic indicators, and discharge criteria. No therapy has been shown to demonstrate any particular effectiveness. The clinicians agreed that a subset of SARS patients, perhaps 10%, decline, usually around day 7, and need mechanical assistance to breathe. The care of these people is often complicated by the presence of other diseases. In this group, mortality is high. Age over 40 years also appears to be associated with a more severe form of disease. Countries have made travel recommendations for their citizens, using the guidance provided by WHO and other considerations such as feasibility of medical evacuation of their citizens and their insurance coverage should they become infected. On 28 March, at the end of the second week of the global response, China, an initially reluctant partner in the global alert and response at the start, became a full partner in the three working groups that were studying SARS, and concluded that the outbreaks of SARS elsewhere in Asia were related to the outbreak in Guangdong Province. The Chinese government has announced that SARS is being given top priority. A system of alert and response for all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being developed. Daily electronic reporting of new cases and deaths, by province, has begun. Equally important, health officials have begun daily televised press conferences, thus taking the important step of increasing the awareness of the population and hospital staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control. The next weeks and months will tell whether the global alert and response will contain the current SARS outbreaks, preventing SARS from becoming yet another endemic infectious disease in human populations, or whether SARS will remain confined to its origins in nature, to re-emerge at yet another time and place. It is clear that the responsibility for containing the emergence of any new infectious disease showing international spread lies on all countries. In a world where all national borders are porous when confronted by a microbial threat, it is in the interest of all populations for countries to share the information they may have as soon as it is available. In so doing, they will allow both near and distant countries – all neighbours in our globalized world – to benefit from the understanding they have gained. "",)",2781
"(' ### Affected areas, status of SARS outbreaks in individual countries 12 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported Affected areas On Friday, WHO added Beijing, China to its list of SARS-affected areas. Areas are added to the list following indication that chains of local transmission are occurring. The greatest concern arises when cases occur outside the established risk groups of health care workers and persons in close face-to- face contact with patients, such as household contacts and hospital visitors. In addition to Beijing, other affected areas in China include Guangdong Province, Hong Kong SAR, Shanxi Province, and Taiwan Province. Toronto, Singapore, and Hanoi are also listed as affected. In most other countries reporting SARS cases, the disease remains confined to a few imported cases, with no or very little spread of infection to others. China A WHO team of five experts has been invited by the Beijing Health Bureau to visit health facilities and review the SARS situation in Beijing. The invitation followed WHO concern about management of the SARS situation by health authorities, particularly in relation to case reporting and contact tracing. The meetings, which began on Friday, will continue throughout next week. Specific objectives are to support the strengthening of surveillance and reporting, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of cases. No reports from China were received today. Hong Kong Hong Kong has today reported a cumulative total of 1108 cases with 35 deaths. This represents an increase of 49 new cases admitted to hospital with symptoms of SARS, and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. Of the cases newly admitted to hospital, 3 are in health care workers, and 11 are from the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The majority of Hong Kong’s cases are clustered in hospitals and in the densely populated Amoy Gardens housing estate. Health authorities are continuing to investigate a possible environmental factor that may explain the concentration of cases in a single wing of a single building, Block E. Health officials are also investigating whether an outbreak in a second housing estate may be related to the Amoy Gardens outbreak. The Department of Health has today posted on its web site a detailed list of buildings where residents have developed SARS. Singapore Singapore has today reported a cumulative total of 147 SARS cases of which 60 remain hospitalized, with 15 in intensive care. Recent concern has centered on clusters of SARS cases seen in health workers, inpatients, and visitors at Singapore General Hospital and Ton Tock Seng Hospital. WHO has collaborated with health authorities in investigations and contact tracing that have linked most cases in the hospital outbreaks to a single “super-spreader.” This patient was treated at Ton Tock Seng Hospital from 5 to 20 March, where he is thought to have become infected. He was subsequently admitted to Singapore General Hospital on 24 March. The patient showed a very atypical clinical course before being isolated on 2 April. This late isolation is thought to explain, in part, the large number of exposed and infected individuals linked to the single patient. Ongoing investigations have linked the outbreaks at Singapore General Hospital, Ton Tock Seng Hospital, and other hospitals in Singapore to clear trains of transmission Viet Nam In Viet Nam, one new case was reported and one case was removed from the list. The cumulative number of reported cases (62) remains the same as yesterday. High vigilance, excellent contact tracing, and good infection control are in place and are expected to keep the number of new cases, associated with the initial outbreak, small. Canada Health Canada is today reporting 101 probable SARS cases. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. Ontario is reporting 98 probable cases. Three probable cases are reported in British Columbia. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2960 cases, with 119 deaths, have been reported from 19 countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. No reports from China were received today. The 3 new deaths were reported in Hong Kong SAR. New cases were reported in Canada (3), Hong Kong (49), Taiwan, China (2), Singapore (14), Thailand (1), and the United Kingdom (1). 12 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported ',)",2960
"(' ### Situation in China, status of scientific and clinical knowledge 14 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported Situation in China China has today reported 109 new probable cases of SARS and 6 deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 1418 cases and 64 deaths. The largest number of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were reported. In addition, two provinces reported SARS cases for the first time – 10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian. The reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system, recently introduced by Chinese authorities, is working to detect and report cases. However, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with the challenge of SARS. Last week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that the health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases of SARS occurred in mid-November, had responded well to the outbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of other provinces, that lack Guangdong’s strong health system, to respond promptly and effectively to SARS. While Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some hospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit military hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO staff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official response to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing. WHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China. Shanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request and follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and will soon travel to China. Status of scientific knowledge Canadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will boost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a vaccine. The rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by collaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at laboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March. A PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been shown to be ten times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for SARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll out by the end of this week. Status of clinical knowledge Data available to WHO indicate that 96% of persons developing SARS recover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4% who are dying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday to gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and pool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of 213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1 in each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported four probable cases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have other causes. China, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected area. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most seriously affected area. Three of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend occurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a previously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or in persons with pre-existing disease.

"(' ### Status of diagnostic test, significance of “super spreaders”, situation in China 15 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported SARS diagnostic test kit made available to members of WHO network Scientists participating in the WHO collaborative network of laboratories have developed several diagnostic tests for SARS. These include a so-called “PCR” test, which allows detection of the distinctive genetic information of a virus. Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, were made publicly available by network laboratories on the open WHO web site (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/) on 4 April. The primers have since been used by numerous countries around the world. WHO scientists are now increasingly optimistic that the current PCR diagnostic test for SARS can rapidly be fine-tuned to a stage ready for roll out. Fine- tuning is needed because of important limitations in the ability of the current test to rule out the presence of coronavirus in SARS cases. Yesterday, the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany informed WHO that primers developed there are being made available, in the form of a ready-to-use kit, by a Hamburg-based biotechnology firm. Apart from ease of use, the test kit has the advantage of built-in quality control. WHO was further informed by the Hamburg Institute that the test will be offered at no cost to laboratories participating in the WHO collaborative network. The network, which includes leading laboratories from ten countries, was set up last month to expedite identification of the SARS causative agent and, in parallel, to rapidly develop a diagnostic test. Initial testing of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield the data needed to assess the test’s performance, in comparison with primers developed by other WHO network laboratories. The ability to detect persons infected with the SARS virus at an early stage is a key measure of performance. WHO has been concerned that weaknesses in earlier experimental tests for SARS would allow too many virus carriers to slip past undetected. Existing PCR tests are very specific but may not detect all patients who are excreting coronavirus. Early and reliable detection of the SARS virus in samples will be of great assistance in helping health care staff determine which persons presenting with fever and other suspicion-arousing symptoms should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict procedures of infection control. Such procedures will, in turn, greatly reduce the likelihood that infection will spread to others. Various WHO network laboratories are endeavouring to improve their PCR testing protocols and primers to increase their reliability. The Bernhard-Nocht Institute is a member of the WHO network of collaborating laboratories. The rapid development of the test kit is one example of how scientific knowledge, being generated by dedicated scientists, can be rapidly translated into a practical control tool. Explanation of so-called SARS “super-spreaders” “Super-spreader” is a term that has been used to describe certain individuals with atypical pneumonia, now recognized as cases of SARS, who have been implicated in spreading the disease to numerous other individuals. The phenomenon of a “super-spreader”, which is not a recognized medical condition, dates back to the early days of the outbreak. At that time, when SARS was just becoming known as a severe new disease, many patients were thought to be suffering from atypical pneumonia having another cause, and were therefore not treated as special cases requiring special precautions of isolation and infection control. As a result, stringent infection control measures were not in place. In the absence of protective measures, many health care workers, relatives, and hospital visitors were exposed to the SARS virus and subsequently developed SARS. Since infection control measures have been put in place, the number of new cases of SARS arising from a single SARS source case has been significantly reduced. When investigating current chains of continuing transmission, it is important to look for points in the history of case detection and patient management when procedures for infection control may have broken down. China The WHO team of experts in Beijing was today granted permission to visit military hospitals. The situation of SARS cases in certain military hospitals has been the source of numerous rumours concerning the magnitude of the SARS outbreak. The WHO team has so far visited one such hospital but hopes to visit others soon. The decision by Beijing authorities is a welcome indication of China’s willingness to come to terms with the SARS outbreak on the mainland. Yesterday, China’s president Hu Jintao said on state television that he was “very worried” by SARS. The WHO Beijing team is expected to finish its preliminary investigation on the status of SARS in China tomorrow. Additional WHO teams will travel soon to other parts of China. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3235 cases of SARS, with 154 deaths, have been reported from 22 countries. This represents an increase of 66 new cases and ten deaths compared with the previous day. Nine of the ten deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR. One death was reported in Singapore. ',)",3235
"(' ### Situation in China and Hong Kong, status of diagnostic tests 17 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported China Chinese authorities have today reported 12 new cases of SARS. Nine new cases were reported from Guangdong Province, and one each in Inner Mongolia and Sichuan Province. Ningxia, a poor province in the remote western part of the country, announced its first case today. Beijing reported no new cases and no new deaths. Today’s figures do not include cases in Beijing’s military hospitals. The military hospitals, which are not obliged by Chinese law to report cases to health authorities, have been the focus of considerable rumours over the past several days. A WHO team began visits to Beijing’s military hospitals yesterday. The recent decision of military hospitals in Guangdong Province to report SARS cases to the authorities may set an important precedent. WHO staff in China have been further encouraged by the presence of national surveillance and reporting teams in provinces that are now reporting cases. The presence of national SARS teams actively searching for cases is a welcome sign that the severity of the SARS threat is being taken seriously by the government. An additional WHO team will be travelling to Shanghai next week. Hong Kong: investigation of the Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Department of Health, together with the Department of Environment, Transport and Works, has today released the results of an extensive investigation into the possible cause of a large cluster of SARS cases among residents in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The report draws on findings from numerous studies designed to determine whether an environmental source of the SARS virus might explain the large and unusual cluster of SARS cases. As of 15 April, health authorities had reported a total of 321 individuals affected by SARS who are residents in Amoy Gardens. A large proportion of cases are concentrated in vertically linked flats in a single building, Block E. Attention has focused on possible transmission via the sewage system. Among several unusual features, the Amoy cluster includes a high proportion of cases presenting with diarrhoea, estimated at about 60%. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea has typically been seen in only 2% to 7% of cases. WHO epidemiologists are now studying the report, which was submitted to WHO earlier today by Hong Kong’s Department of Health. Status of diagnostic tests Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories met in Geneva yesterday to map out research priorities for the coming month. The network also announced conclusive proof, from animal trials, that a new coronavirus, discovered by the group last month, is the agent that causes SARS. With the cause of SARS now proven, network scientists are giving top priority to the development of better diagnostic tests. The first step is the development of a data bank of specimens from a range of SARS patients in different countries. The scientists are also building a bank of specimens taken from individual patients at different stages of disease, including recovery. Such a time-series of specimens will be vital in developing a test that is capable of detecting virus at the first stage when people become capable of infecting others. It will also help determine the stage in the course of the illness when recovered patients can safely return to their jobs and families with no risk of infecting others. Other plans for the coming weeks include the development of a genetic library of specimens from SARS patients from different parts of the world. It is not yet known whether genetic differences in the coronavirus, which has now been fully sequenced by several network laboratories, will have significance for work on drug and vaccine research and development. Existing PCR diagnostic tests are insufficiently powerful to rule out, with confidence, the presence of the virus in suspect or probable SARS cases early in the course of the disease. WHO has been concerned that use of the current PCR test kit, which is being made available by a German biotechnology company initially at no cost, may produce test results that give a false sense of security, allowing persons carrying the virus to slip past undetected. Without a more reliable diagnostic tool, hospital staff confronted with a suspect SARS case have no option other than to isolate patients and manage them according to strict infection control practices as precautionary measures. Such measures are stressful for patients and place a considerable strain on health services. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3389 cases with 165 deaths have been reported from twenty five countries. Countries reporting their first probable cases on today’s list include Australia (3) and Mongolia (3). A large number of suspect SARS cases turn out, on further investigation, to have other, common causes. ',)",3389
"(' ### Update on Hong Kong and China, first SARS case reported in India 18 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported Hong Kong: investigation of Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Secretary for Environment, Transport and Works, in collaboration with eight other government agencies, has released the results of an extensive investigation of an unusual cluster of SARS cases concentrated in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The investigation, which drew on epidemiological, environmental, and laboratory studies, has identified sewage contaminated with the SARS virus as the probable point source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation has focused on the role of a 33-year-old man who developed symptoms of SARS on 14 March and visited a relative in Block E, Amoy Gardens on 14 and 19 March. His symptoms at that time included diarrhoea. Based on the epidemiology of the outbreak, officials believe that this patient, who is linked to the infection of two relatives and two nurses, was the source of the outbreak. Subsequent rapid spread to other residents (321 cases of as 15 April) is thought to have involved defective U-traps in bathrooms, an amplifying effect of bathroom exhaust fans, a cracked sewer vent pipe serving Block E, and an aerodynamic effect in a lightwell to which bathroom windows opened. Laboratory investigations confirmed the presence of the SARS virus in a swab from the toilet bowl in the bathroom of a SARS patient, but not in numerous other environmental samples. “This is a plausible hypothesis,” says David Heymann, Executive Director of communicable diseases at WHO. “This is the kind of study that is needed to find what it is in the environment that is transmitting this disease.” Further work will be needed to reach firm conclusions about the source of the outbreak and the unusual way in which infection has spread. The study found no epidemiological or laboratory evidence that the SARS virus was transmitted by air, water, or infected dust aerosols. “It is reassuring that speculations about a possible airborne transmission have not been borne out by the evidence available to date,” says Heymann. The transmission of SARS within the Amoy Gardens estate is the first known instance involving a possible environmental spread of the virus. Thorough multi-disciplinary investigation of this unusual outbreak, as is now under way, is fully warranted. Once the outbreak is fully understood, the next important step will be to develop measures that can prevent other instances of environmental spread occurring under similar circumstances. China advises officials on SARS China’s top leaders cautioned officials this morning not to cover up the spread of SARS. Yesterday, during an urgent meeting of China’s highest ruling body presided over by President Hu Jintao, Beijing explicitly warned against the covering up of SARS cases and demanded the “accurate, timely and honest reporting of the SARS situation,” according to Xinhua, the country’s official news agency. China’s leaders called SARS a serious threat to the nation’s reform, development and stability, adding that party and government leaders would be held accountable for the situations in their respective jurisdictions. Earlier this week, the WHO Beijing team estimated that Beijing may have as many as 200 cases of SARS, rather than the 37 officially reported. The team recommended that Beijing improve its reporting system, possibly using as a model procedures followed in Guangdong Province, where the daily SARS reports are considered reliable and transparent. WHO experts also recommended that Beijing revise its definition of what constitutes a “suspect” SARS case. At present, many patients reported by Beijing as “suspect” would be classified as “probable” according to the case definition set out by WHO and used in official notifications of cases to WHO. As WHO reports only probable cases in its daily cumulative totals, such a change on the part of Beijing would result in a large increase in the number of cases notified to WHO. First SARS case reported in India India reported its first case of SARS yesterday. The National Institute of Virology in the western coastal state of Goa confirmed the presence of the new coronavirus which causes SARS, in samples from the patient. He is said to have recovered, and is still being kept in isolation after visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, and briefly stopping over in Mumbai. There have been fears that if the SARS virus reached India, it could spread rapidly in the subcontinent’s crowded cities and health facilities. WHO officials believe it is good news that the one case has been detected and reported, as this indicates that the surveillance system is on high alert and working well. As has been demonstrated in many countries, prompt detection of new cases, proper management, and efficient contact tracing can prevent isolated cases from infecting others. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3461 cases with 170 deaths have been reported from 25 countries on five continents. This represents an increase of 72 new cases and 5 deaths since the last WHO update. The deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR (4) and Singapore (1). ',)",3461
"(' ### Unanswered questions: a critical point in the evolution of SARS 19 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported As probable SARS cases continue to be reported from a growing number of countries, WHO is taking stock of what is known about the new disease, particularly concerning its mode of spread, and what remains a puzzle. The agent that causes SARS has now been conclusively identified. The SARS virus is a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or animal virus in the Coronavirus family. Because the virus is new, much about its behaviour is poorly understood. Key questions, which are undergoing intense study, include stages in the course of infection when virus shedding may be highest, and the various concentrations of virus in different body fluids. Scientists are also working to determine the amount of time the virus can survive in the environment on both dry surfaces and in suspension, including in faecal matter. The vast majority of countries reporting probable SARS cases are dealing with a small number of imported cases. Experience has shown that when these cases are promptly detected, isolated, and managed according to strict procedures of infection control, further spread to hospital staff and family members either does not occur at all or results in a very small number of secondary infections. These experiences confirm abundant early evidence that the SARS virus spreads, in the vast majority of cases, through exposure to respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. However, information now emerging from outbreaks in Hong Kong and Canada is raising some important new questions about SARS. In Hong Kong, a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases (321) seen in residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate has raised the possibility of transmission from an environmental source. In addition, reports from Hong Kong health authorities indicate that patients in this cluster depart in some ways from the previously established clinical picture. The disease appears to be more severe both in Amoy residents and in related cases among hospital staff. Around 20% of Amoy-related cases require intensive care, compared with 10% seen in non-Amoy cases. Some deaths are now occurring in younger, previously healthy persons as well as in the elderly and persons with underlying disease. Around 66% of Amoy Gardens patients present with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks. Speculation centres on whether these cases represent infection with high virus loads, as might occur following exposure to a concentrated environmental source, or whether the virus may have mutated into a more virulent form. Viruses in the Coronavirus family are known to mutate frequently. In Canada, concern has centred around a cluster of 31 suspect and probable cases in members of a charismatic religious group, the health care workers who have treated them, and close family and social contacts. The outbreak is particularly disturbing because of its potential to move into the wider community. Large meetings of the religious group at two events, on 28 and 29 March, may have led to multiple additional exposures, especially among the members of this close-knit religious group. Intense contact tracing, home quarantine, and close follow-up by health officials may work to prevent further spread of cases in the general community. The index case in this cluster has been traced to contact, in a hospital emergency room, with a subsequently fatal SARS case. The outbreak is regarded as a test case of whether rigorous contact tracing and other stringent public health measures can contain further spread even when very large numbers of persons may have been exposed. This index case has also been linked to three of four SARS cases concentrated in the same block of a 247-unit condominium in Toronto. As the fourth case could not be linked to direct contact with a SARS patient, some speculation arose concerning possible environmental contamination within the building as the source of the fourth infection. However, all four cases occurred in early April, with 4 April being the date of onset of the fourth case. The incubation period has now passed with no further cases detected. There appears to be little risk that the case arose from an environmental source. Viet Nam A week has passed since Viet Nam officials reported a new probable case of SARS. No new deaths have occurred during this period. The situation in Hanoi seems to have stabilized. Following the introduction of infection control measures in the French Hospital, the transmission of SARS appears to have been contained. Ten patients are now listed as recovering from SARS, none of whom is listed as in critical condition. The Vietnamese government is considering closing its land border with China in an attempt to prevent the importation of SARS cases. In a proposal submitted to the Prime Minister by the Ministry of Health, the 1,130 kilometre border with China would be sealed indefinitely to overland visitors. WHO officials in Viet Nam said earlier this week that while Viet Nam appears to have controlled the SARS outbreak within its borders, it still faces the threat of massive importation of the disease from China. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3547 cases with 182 deaths have been reported from 25 countries. Compared with yesterday, 12 new deaths, all in Hong Kong SAR, have been reported. ',)",3547
"(' ### WHO extends its SARS-related travel advice to Beijing and Shanxi Province in China and to Toronto Canada 23 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and in Toronto, Canada, WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that persons planning to travel to these destinations consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel advice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China will be reassessed in three weeks time. Following global alerts about cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number. On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include screening of air passengers departing from certain areas, continue to apply. On 2 April, WHO recommended that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary recommendation has been reassessed daily and remains in effect. Subsequent information from the Chinese government about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Beijing and Shanxi Province has been carefully reviewed by WHO. This assessment has considered the magnitude of the outbreak, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases, the extent of local chains of transmission, and evidence that travellers are becoming infected while in one area and then subsequently exporting the disease elsewhere. On the basis of this assessment, WHO is extending its 2 April travel advice to include Beijing and Shanxi Province. Using the same criteria, WHO has assessed the SARS situation in Toronto, Canada. The outbreak in this area has continued to grow in magnitude and has affected groups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, their families and other close person-to-person contacts, although all the cases reported have identified links to known SARS cases. In addition, a small number of persons with SARS, now in other countries in the world, appear to have acquired the infection while in Toronto. On the basis of this information, WHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS- related travel advice. This advice will be re-examined in three weeks time, which is twice the maximum incubation period of SARS. The WHO travel advice is issued in order to protect public health and reduce opportunities for further international spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 22 April, a cumulative total of 3947 cases had been reported from 25 countries on five continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage. The SARS situation is assessed on a daily basis to determine whether other areas need to be included in the travel advice and if additional precautionary measures are required. All WHO SARS alerts, travel advice, daily cumulative case counts and other information are available at the WHO web site. ',)",3947
"(' ### Situation in China 24 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported an additional 125 probable SARS cases, including the first case from Anhui. The new figures bring the cumulative number of reported probable cases in China to 2422. Twenty-one provinces have now reported probable cases, with another five provinces reporting suspected cases. Of the 125 new cases, 24 occurred among health workers, including 17 in Beijing. Altogether, China has reported 541 cases in health workers during the course of its SARS outbreak, which began in mid-November 2002. Beijing has reported the highest number of new cases (89), followed by Guangdong (15), and Inner Mongolia (11). Beijing reported 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative number of SARS deaths in China to 110. With a cumulative total of 1359 cases, Guangdong has the highest total number of probable cases, followed by Beijing, with 774 probable cases. The number of reported cases in Beijing is increasing on a daily basis, and WHO is following the situation there closely. Data provided to date do not allow determination of whether newly reported cases are old SARS cases only now coming to light, or newly detected cases. Better interpretation of reports, and a more complete assessment of the underlying situation, require information on date of onset and location of cases. WHO has proposed to Beijing city government officials a meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, of WHO technical staff with Beijing disease experts in order to review reporting procedures. Yesterday Beijing authorities closed elementary and middle schools early as an extension of the already planned national May Day holidays. Schools have been asked to inform parents, teachers, and visitors about the symptoms of SARS. Persons with symptoms have been asked not to visit schools. School authorities have been asked to conduct close monitoring and to send home any students, teachers, other staff, and visitors showing symptoms suggestive of SARS. In Shanghai, the WHO team of experts continued visits to hospitals and the Shanghai Centre for Disease Control. The team has also examined procedures for contact tracing. The team will present its findings tomorrow and return to Beijing on Saturday. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 4439 cases with 263 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an increase of 158 new cases and 12 deaths compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Singapore (2). Bulgaria reported its first case today. ',)",4439
"(' 25 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported ### Optimism in Viet Nam, caution urged when using diagnostic tests Viet Nam may soon become the first country to contain SARS No new cases of SARS have been detected in Viet Nam for 17 days in a row, despite a high level of awareness and good surveillance. Although numerous rumours have been reported, all have been investigated by WHO and government officials, and all suspect cases have been determined to have other causes. The most recent probable case was detected on 8 April, bringing the cumulative total in Viet Nam to 63 cases. Detection of that case initially brought disappointment, as it occurred after no new cases had been reported over an 8-day period. Since the outbreak was first recognized in Hanoi in late February, 5 deaths have occurred. As of today, five patients remain hospitalized. Viet Nam was the second country to experience a SARS outbreak. The first was China, where an outbreak began in Guangdong Province in mid-November of last year. If no new cases are detected by 30 April (a date which marks the end of two incubation periods), Viet Nam could become the first country to be taken off the list of SARS-affected countries. This achievement would also make Viet Nam the first country to successfully contain its SARS outbreak. SARS was first identified by Dr Carlo Urbani, a WHO infectious disease specialist. Dr Urbani alerted the world to SARS when cases of an unusual and severe respiratory disease began appearing among health staff treating a Chinese-American businessman at the French Hospital in Hanoi. The patient, a 48-year-old resident of Hong Kong, was admitted to hospital on 26 February with fever and respiratory symptoms. His recent travel history included trips to Guangdong Province, Shanghai, and Macao SAR. By 20 March, at least 22 staff at the Hanoi hospital were ill with influenza-like symptoms. Twenty had signs of pneumonia, and two were in serious condition. The Chinese-American businessman died of SARS in Hong Kong on 13 March. Dr Urbani died of SARS in Thailand on 29 March. WHO country staff attribute Viet Nam’s success in combating SARS to the quick manner in which the country initially reacted. “After Carlo identified the disease, we were able to influence the hospital to take the right infection control measures very quickly,” said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Viet Nam. The commitment of the Vietnamese government came soon thereafter, including high-level support for a WHO coordinated response in Hanoi. “The first priority was to contain the disease and monitor each case,” said Brudon. International collaboration to combat SARS came quickly via the Japanese government and Médecins Sans Frontières, who both worked under the umbrella of the WHO initiative in Viet Nam. Viet Nam was fortunate in that the country had only a single index case, who spent less than 3 days in Hanoi prior to hospitalization. This short time in the community effectively limited opportunities to transmit the SARS virus to a contained hospital environment. Viet Nam’s northern Quang Ninh province recently began barring Chinese tourists at its overland border with China in an effort to prevent importation of SARS. This move comes ahead of any decision by the Vietnamese national government to seal its border with China indefinitely, as has been recommended by the country’s ministry of health. Caution urged in the use of diagnostic tests WHO is currently working with four major laboratories to develop a clinically validated diagnostic test for SARS. Standard test reagents are being established to assess the quality of the test and ensure its reliability. When the test has been developed and clinically validated, it can be used reliably to confirm cases of SARS. However, test development and validation are expected to take at least another two weeks. In the meantime, laboratories in a growing number of countries have developed SARS diagnostic tests, often based on information made available at the WHO web site. It is extremely important for national authorities and medical and hospital staff to understand the limitations of currently available tests. Their use as the basis for treatment decisions may give a false sense of security that can allow persons carrying the SARS virus, and therefore capable of infecting others, to escape detection. PCR tests can detect genetic material of the SARS virus in various specimens, including blood, stool, respiratory secretions, and tissue samples. Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available on the WHO web site by laboratories in the WHO network. The primers have since been used by many countries around the world. These currently available PCR tests are very specific but lack sensitivity. This means that negative test results cannot be relied on as proof that a patient is not infected with the SARS virus. In the absence of a reliable diagnostic test, national authorities are strongly advised to continue to base decisions concerning what constitutes both a suspect and a probable case of SARS on the present clinical and epidemiological case definition, and not to rely on the results of diagnostic tests. WHO advises that all suspect and probable SARS cases be placed in isolation and managed according to strict procedures of infection control. All other currently available diagnostic tests also have important limitations. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) test detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients reliably, but only as from about day 21 after the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Immunofluorescence assay tests detect antibodies in serum of SARS patients, but only after about day 10 following the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Moreover, the test is demanding. Reliable results depend on the use of fixed SARS virus, an immunofluorescence microscope, and an experienced microscopist. Virus in specimens from SARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures and growing the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as the SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture, which is the only method of demonstrating the existence of a live virus, is a very demanding and time- consuming test. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 4649 cases with 274 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an additional 210 cases and 11 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China (5) and Hong Kong SAR (6). In China, the Ministry of Health has today informed WHO of 180 newly reported probable cases. The breakdown by location is Beijing (103), Inner Mongolia (23), Guangdong (15), Tianjin (13), Hebei (12), Shanxi (11), and one case each in Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. These latest figures bring the cumulative number of probable cases reported in China to 2601.

Beijing reported 3 deaths, Shanxi 1, and Guangdong 1, bringing the cumulative number of deaths in China to 115.

"(' 26 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported ### Situation in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Viet Nam Preliminary findings of the WHO Shanghai team A WHO team of six experts, in Shanghai since Monday, has provided a preliminary report of its findings. The team was invited by Shanghai authorities to assess the SARS situation in China’s second largest city. Among its activities, the team examined the SARS surveillance and reporting system, investigated rumours that the case burden might be higher than officially reported, and visited 10 health facilities, 3 district Centres for Disease Control, and the municipal Centre for Disease Control. The team was given free access to all requested data, patient registries, and facilities, which were visited on very short notice. The team found no evidence of systematic underreporting of cases, and concluded that the level of preparedness and response was good. Reporting of cases appeared to be open, frank, and accurate. Over the past 3–4 weeks, authorities designated two hospitals as dedicated to the treatment of SARS patients and set up cough and fever clinics. The team also found a very high level of government commitment to tackle the SARS problem. Many questions remain about why Shanghai has been spared a SARS outbreak on the scale of that seen in Beijing. Had a larger number of cases occurred, it is not certain whether the systems presently in place would have been able to cope. Situation in Hong Kong Health authorities announced 17 new cases, including 3 in health care workers, and 6 deaths, including the youngest SARS fatality in Hong Kong to date. This was a previously healthy 28-year-old man from the Amoy Gardens housing estate cluster. The other deaths occurred in men aged 38, 40, 61, and 70 years, and a 45-year-old woman. Only one of these patients, the 70-year-old man, had a history of chronic disease. Of the six deaths announced yesterday, three were from the Amoy Gardens cluster. Authorities are continuing to investigate a small cluster of cases in the Tung Tau housing estate, where six cases have occurred in vertically linked flats. Presently available epidemiological evidence gives no reason to anticipate an outbreak at the estate on the scale of Amoy Gardens cluster, which involved more than 320 residents of a single building. A WHO team of environmental and “sick building” experts arrived in Hong Kong to assist local experts in the investigation of possible environmental sources of the virus. No new cases in Viet Nam for 18 days The SARS situation in Viet Nam has remained stable, at 63 cases and 5 deaths, for 18 consecutive days. Active investigation of numerous rumours has failed to detect a new case of SARS throughout this period. If the trend continues, the country will be removed from the list of affected areas on Monday, making Viet Nam the first country to contain its SARS outbreak. WHO officials in Viet Nam cautioned against a lapse in the present high state of alert, as the risk persists that a single imported case could seed an outbreak, as happened in February. However, the government showed strong commitment at the highest level from the beginning of the outbreak. Task forces and provincial teams were established and have worked well. Good procedures of infection control were rapidly established and eventually proved effective in preventing further spread among hospital staff. Should the country experience an imported case, this newly established infrastructure would most likely be effective in preventing another large outbreak. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 4836 cases with 293 deaths have occurred in 26 countries. This represents an increase of 190 new cases and 19 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in Canada (3), China (7), Hong Kong SAR (6), the Philippines (1), and Singapore (2).

"(' 5 July WHO is today removing Taiwan from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. This achievement means that all known chains of person- to-person transmission of the SARS virus have now been broken. “With the last known chain of transmission interrupted in Taiwan, the whole world can breathe an initial sigh of relief,” said Dr David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. “At the same time, public health must not let down its guard, as more cases could still surface somewhere in the world. SARS has taught us that a single case is capable of igniting an outbreak.” “Taiwan was unlucky. A lapse in infection control in a single hospital allowed the outbreak, which had been under good control, to escalate. But the authorities reacted quickly and appropriately. In doing so, they have also strengthened capacity to deal with any future outbreaks.” The last reported probable case in Taiwan, and – for the moment – in the world, was detected and isolated on 15 June. Two consecutive 10-day incubation periods have now passed with no further cases detected. The achievement comes just slightly more than four months since the virus began moving around the world, in late February, along the routes of international air travel. Taiwan’s first case of SARS occurred in a 54-year-old businessman with a travel history, in late February, to Guangdong Province, China, where the earliest cases of SARS are now known to have occurred. The businessman was hospitalized on 8 March. Taiwan eventually had to cope with the third largest outbreak on record, including 674 cases and 84 deaths. The largest outbreaks occurred in mainland China (5327 cases and 348 deaths) and Hong Kong (1755 cases and 298 deaths). The outbreak in Taiwan initially grew slowly, with only 23 probable cases detected in the first month. Of these, a single health care worker, a doctor, became infected when he treated the wife of the businessman. All of the earliest cases could be directly linked to close contact with a SARS patient, or had a history of recent travel to an area where local transmission was known to be occurring. Only 4 of the early cases resulted from secondary spread within Taiwan. The outbreak began to escalate in mid-April following a lapse in infection control procedures, which allowed the disease to spread rapidly within the hospital setting and then into the wider community. In dealing with the emergency that followed, health authorities rapidly introduced a series of sweeping measures. The surveillance system was upgraded and began to deliver the kind of information needed for prompt and targeted action. Hospital procedures for infection control were tightened, and a logistics system was developed to ensure the efficient delivery of protective equipment and other supplies. Mass education campaigns persuaded the population to check frequently for fever and report promptly at fever clinics, which greatly reduced the time between onset of symptoms and isolation of patients. The establishment of a mechanism for coordinating the response of all relevant sectors was another key to Taiwan’s success. The global SARS outbreak developed quickly and dramatically, creating challenging and stressful demands on staff and health authorities at every outbreak site. The containment of SARS required heroic efforts and extraordinary measures that are difficult to sustain over time. “Interruption of the last known chain of person-to-person transmission has come just in time. Health systems at every major outbreak site were strained to the limits of their capacity.” said Dr Heymann. WHO continues to receive rumours of possible cases, which indicates that surveillance systems are working well. To date, all recently reported possible cases have been aggressively investigated and determined to have other causes. Failure to detect new cases over the next two weeks will greatly increase confidence that the SARS coronavirus has indeed been pushed out of its new human host, although a return of the disease cannot be ruled out completely on the basis of current knowledge.

"(' 25 August 2003 An outbreak of respiratory illness in an aged care facility in Canada has now been extensively investigated for SARS and WHO concludes the disease is not SARS. On 14 August, Canadian public health officials reported to WHO that an unidentified respiratory disease in a Surrey, British Columbia health care facility had infected 143 residents and staff. Some initial testing suggested the SARS coronavirus may have played a role. Now, WHO and Canadian health authorities have gathered enough evidence to conclude that the outbreak in British Columbia is not SARS. Analysis from laboratories in Canada and the United States did not confirm the initial concern that SARS had mutated into a milder disease. Two lines of evidence have converged to dismiss the SARS concern. Clinically, the disease itself was strikingly different from the SARS outbreak in the spring. The features of the current outbreak included a low case fatality, runny nose, lack of fever in most patients, and no SARS-like changes in the lung seen on X-ray. Now, sequencing of a portion of the virus causing the outbreak has led to the finding that it was not the SARS coronavirus but another human coronavirus known as OC43. This virus, which is one of the causes of the common cold, has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in aged care facilities in other countries. In terms of SARS, Canada continues to be a safe destination for travellers and travellers from Canada pose no exceptional risk to other countries.

"("" 2 September 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported On the basis of the assessment team's visit and analysis of the data (see previous report), WHO has now reported a cumulative number of 6353 cases since the beginning of the outbreak in Monrovia in June until 17 August. Systematic reporting of deaths from cholera has not been undertaken in health centres. WHO has put an emergency surveillance system in place to fill this gap. The first peak reached 935 cases during 7-13 July. The weekly average decreased by end July -early August, although the worsening security situation prevented cholera patients from attending health care facilities. Since the ceasefire and the improvement in security, the number of registered cases has been rapidly increasing. According to figures collected at cholera treatment centres in Monrovia, there were 727 registered cases during 4-10 August and 1203 cases during11-17 August. More people are now returning to their homes or to refugee camps outside Monrovia; as a result, the cholera outbreak is spreading from central Monrovia to peripheral areas of the city and neighbouring districts. There are approximately 230 000 people in internally displaced persons camps in Monrovia living in very difficult conditions. The sanitation is poor and safe water is scarce with only 2 litres per day per person available. In order to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and to limit cholera transmission, WHO, in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, has launched a campaign for the chlorination of water in Monrovia. The chlorination of 5000 open wells in the city has begun and the process will be repeated regularly until the cholera risk has diminished. Nutrition screening carried out by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) found that 40 % of the children screened are suffering from acute malnutrition which may increase the rate of severe cholera cases.

"(' 5 January 2004 Results from laboratory tests received today have confirmed a case of SARS in a 32-year-old man in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The patient is a television producer who has been under treatment, in isolation, at a hospital in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, since 20 December. This is the first confirmed case of SARS in 2004, and the first case not linked to a laboratory accident that has occurred since the initial outbreak of SARS was declared contained on 5 July 2003. Laboratory-related cases occurred after that date in Singapore in September and in Taiwan, China in December of last year. The Guangdong case has been under investigation, with WHO support, since 26 December, when the suspected case was initially reported by Chinese authorities. Previous diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results. In view of the limitations of SARS diagnostic tests, confirmation of positive results by a WHO-designated reference laboratory is required for a definitive diagnosis of SARS. The confirmatory tests were conducted in Hong Kong by both the University of Hong Kong at the Queen Mary Hospital and the Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health. Both laboratories are members of the WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Diagnosis that collectively identified the SARS coronavirus in mid-April 2003, and have considerable diagnostic expertise. The source of infection for this newly confirmed case remains unclear. Several lines of investigation last year suggest that SARS may have originated from contact with wild animals sold for human consumption at live markets in southern China. Studies conducted last year detected a SARS-like virus in some animal species, including the masked palm civet. Retrospective analysis of patient records has linked several of the earliest cases, which began occurring in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, to contact with wild animals. However, no animal reservoir of the SARS coronavirus has been conclusively identified to date. Epidemiological investigations in China have not yet been able to link the patient to exposure to wild animals or any other known or suspected source of the virus. Chinese authorities have introduced several measures as investigation of the case has evolved. The patient has been treated in isolation since his hospitalization on 20 December, four days after the onset of symptoms. All contacts have been traced and followed up. All are reported to be free of symptoms and most have been released from quarantine, suggesting that no further transmission has occurred. Surveillance for additional cases has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces. The single isolated case does not constitute grounds for issuing a SARS alert or recommending any restrictions on travel or trade. At the request of Chinese authorities, additional WHO teams are being sent this week to assist in research aimed at identifying the source of infection and preventing further cases.

"(' 8 January 2004 Health authorities in China have today announced a suspected case of SARS in the southern province of Guangdong. The patient, who has been treated under isolation since 31 December, is a 20-year-old woman from Henan Province who works at a restaurant in Guangzhou, the provincial capital city. The patient felt unwell on 25 December, developed a fever the following day, and sought medical treatment on 31 December. In line with diagnostic and management protocols issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health, she was immediately placed in isolation. She was diagnosed as a suspected case following review by a panel of Chinese SARS experts. Epidemiological investigations and laboratory tests are under way. The patient has been afebrile for the past seven days and is said to be in stable condition. Altogether 100 contacts have been traced and placed under medical observation. At present, no signs or symptoms suggestive of SARS have developed in any of these contacts. The announcement follows Monday’s laboratory confirmation of SARS in a 32-year-old male resident of Guangzhou. The man has fully recovered and has been discharged from hospital. All close contacts of the patient, including health care workers, have remained in good health throughout the observation period, which has now ended. At present, no epidemiological evidence has linked the confirmed case with the suspected case. The possible source of exposure in both cases is under investigation. Symptoms of SARS mimic those of several other respiratory diseases, including many that are more frequently seen during the winter months. Some of these diseases may also give rise to atypical pneumonia. It is likely that numerous other suspected cases will be reported over the coming weeks. All currently available SARS diagnostic tests have shortcomings. In view of these limitations, WHO recommends that specimens taken from suspected SARS cases for laboratory analysis include nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool samples as well as serum. Each specimen should be divided into samples at the bedside, rather than in a laboratory where the risk of contamination is heightened. When positive or inconclusive results are obtained, one of the samples should be sent for independent testing at a WHO-designated SARS reference laboratory. Investigative team arrives in Guangdong A joint team of WHO and Chinese experts has arrived today in Guangdong to investigate possible sources of infection for the confirmed SARS case. Over the coming days, parallel investigations will look at possible human-to-human, animal-to-human, and environmental sources of transmission. Further information about the team is provided on the web site of the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific. Animal experts will also examine conditions surrounding the culling of masked palm civets and other wildlife species, and make recommendations for research that could shed light on the origins of the SARS coronavirus. The SARS virus, which first emerged in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, is thought to have jumped to humans from some unidentified animal or environmental reservoir. Further research is urgently needed to determine sources of human exposure, including the possible involvement of specific animal species. An investigation by a previous joint team of experts, conducted in Guangdong from 20 December to 2 January 2004, found a very high level of awareness of the symptoms of SARS among health care workers and pharmacists, and a very high level of preparedness to introduce appropriate public health measures. Good levels of infection control were in place at all four facilities where the confirmed case was examined or treated. Local and national authorities were rapidly alerted, and the tracing of 81 contacts was completed within 2 days. ',)",2
"(' 14 January 2004 Investigation of cases of acute respiratory illness are continuing in Viet Nam with support from WHO staff. The investigation has been undertaken in response to concerns over the laboratory confirmation, on Sunday, of the presence of avian influenza virus H5N1 in three patients who died of severe respiratory illness in late December and early January. The H5N1 strain implicated in the outbreak has now been partially sequenced. All genes are of avian origin, indicating that the virus that caused death in the three confirmed cases had not yet acquired human genes. The acquisition of human genes increases the likelihood that a virus of avian origin can be readily transmitted from one human to another. Investigations are focusing on the source of infection and possibilities of human-to-human transmission. An outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was detected in southern Viet Nam in the beginning of January. The outbreak is now known to have spread to other provinces in the country. Reports indicate that pigs and ducks have also been infected. Yesterday, officials in the Republic of Korea announced the spread of H5N1 avian influenza to an additional farm. Japan is also experiencing an outbreak in poultry caused by the H5N1 virus. In response to these developments, WHO has initiated a series of activities. These include support to national authorities in investigating the outbreaks and enhanced surveillance activities in Asia. WHO has also initiated the development of candidates and reagents for vaccine production, and antigenic and genetic assessments of the H5N1 strain to provide up-to-date diagnostic tests to national influenza centres. The WHO Global Influenza Network will receive virus and clinical specimens shortly. As a precautionary measure, network laboratories will immediately begin work on the development of a strain that can be used to produce a vaccine. ',)",0

"(' 30 January 2004 China confirms spread of infection in poultry Health and agricultural authorities in China have today informed WHO of further outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry. The outbreaks, which are laboratory confirmed, have been detected in Hunan and Hubei provinces. A confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza at a duck farm in Guangxi province was announced on 27 January. As announced today, outbreaks of disease in poultry have also been detected at farms in Anhui, Shanghai, and Guangdong provinces. According to the authorities, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza is the suspected cause. Samples from birds in these outbreaks are being tested, in China, to confirm the causative agent. Local authorities in the affected provinces have undertaken immediate culling operations and quarantining of farms. Compulsory vaccination of poultry is being introduced. At present, no human cases of H5N1 infection have been detected in China. Development of an H5N1 vaccine for humans: need for samples and viruses With the confirmed spread of H5N1 infection in poultry in China, WHO is again stressing the need for access to samples and viruses from all countries currently experiencing H5N1 outbreaks. Such materials are needed to support laboratory studies being conducted by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Up to now, laboratories in the WHO network have analyzed viruses from the current outbreaks made available by authorities in Cambodia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam. Viruses from the outbreaks in Indonesia, Laos, and Thailand are expected to be available for analysis soon. Network laboratories are now working to develop a prototype virus that can be recommended by WHO for use by companies in the production of a human vaccine effective against H5N1 influenza strains. Both human and avian viruses are needed. Information from these viruses will help WHO and its partners ensure that a fully tested and licensed vaccine for humans is available as soon as possible. Protection of workers involved in culling operations As more countries announce plans for the mass slaughter of poultry, WHO continues to stress the need for personal protection of these workers. Targeted administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to high-risk groups, such as cullers and poultry workers, is being recommended as one of several measures that reduce opportunities for the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype with pandemic potential. Guidelines for the use of seasonal influenza vaccine in humans at risk of H5N1 infection have been issued today. ',)",0

"(' 2 February 2004 New human case confirmed in Thailand Health authorities in Thailand have today announced a new laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The case, a 58-year-old woman, fell ill on 19 January and died on 27 January. This latest case brings the total of human cases in Thailand to 4, of whom 3 have died. To date, human cases of H5N1 have been reported only in Thailand and Viet Nam. Both countries have widespread outbreaks of the disease in poultry. The new case in Thailand brings the total number of cases in these two countries to 14, of whom 11 have died. China announces spread of suspected H5N1 infection in poultry to additional areas WHO has been informed by Chinese authorities that outbreaks in poultry of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza are suspected in additional parts of the country. The new suspected poultry outbreaks have been detected at farms in the eastern province of Zhejiang (geese), in the southwestern province of Yunnan (chickens), in the central province of Henan (chickens), and in Xinjiang Uygar Autonomous Region (chickens) in northwestern China. In addition, further suspected outbreaks have been reported in Hubei (chickens and ducks) and Guangdong (geese) provinces. Both provinces had previously reported outbreaks. Samples taken from diseased birds at all these sites are now being tested in China for the presence of the H5N1 strain. Altogether, confirmed or suspected outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have been reported on poultry farms in 10 of China’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. The additional areas with outbreaks in poultry, announced last week, are Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Anhui provinces. Of these, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. No cases of human H5N1 infection have been reported in China to date. Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission WHO has investigated a cluster of respiratory illness in members of a family from Thai Binh province, Viet Nam. The cluster involves a 31-year-old man, his two sisters, aged 23 and 30 years, and his 28-year-old wife. Both the man and his two sisters have died. The wife has fully recovered. Laboratory tests received over the weekend have confirmed H5N1 infection in the sisters. Neither the man nor his wife was tested. The family members gathered in late December to prepare for the man’s wedding on 3 January. Both the man and one sister are reported to have handled ducks while preparing a meal on 4 January. However, the investigation failed to reveal any direct contact with poultry for the man’s other sister and his wife. In the absence of evidence of direct exposure to poultry in these two cases, WHO epidemiologists are considering various alternative explanations. Both sisters are known to have provided health care for their brother, prior to his hospitalization, and would thus have had opportunities for close exposure. Direct human-to-human transmission following this close exposure is thus one possible explanation. However, contact with an infected bird, or some other environmental source of the virus, is another possible route of infection that has not been ruled out. Outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry are widespread in Viet Nam. Large amounts of the virus are excreted in bird droppings, and can survive for some time in the environment. Limited human-to-human transmission of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is not entirely unexpected, as this has been documented to have occurred on two occasions in the recent past (in Hong Kong in 1997 and in the Netherlands in 2003). Local authorities report that no other family members or wedding guests developed an illness. No illness has been detected in members of the community where the wedding was held, or in health staff involved in care of these cases.

This latest death was in a 6-year-old boy from Suphanburi province To date, Thailand has reported 4 laboratory confirmed cases of H5N1 in humans. All have died. Situation (poultry) in China Authorities in China have confirmed suspected outbreaks of H5N1 avian inflenza in poultry at farms in an additional two provinces, Gansu and Shaanxi. To date, confirmed or suspected outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have been reported at poultry farms in 12 of the country’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Situation (poultry) in Indonesia The outbreak of suspected avian influenza in poultry, previously announced by Indonesian authorities, has now been confirmed as caused by the H5N1 strain. Situation (poultry) worldwide Full details on poultry outbreaks are available at the OIE website. To date, outbreaks in poultry caused by the H5N1 strain have been confirmed in the following countries (listed in order of reporting): * Republic of Korea (12 December 2003 – first outbreak of this disease ever reported) * Viet Nam (8 January 2004 – first outbreak of this disease ever reported) * Japan (12 January 2004 – first outbreak of this disease since 1925) * Thailand (23 January 2004 – first outbreak of this disease ever reported) * Cambodia (24 January 2004) * China (27 January 2004) * Laos (27 January 2004 – H5 confirmed, testing for H5N1 under way) * Indonesia (2 February 2004 – first outbreak of this disease ever reported) Two other areas (Taiwan, China and Pakistan) have reported outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry. However, tests have confirmed that these outbreaks are not caused by the H5N1 strain. In addition, authorities in Hong Kong SAR have reported H5N1 in a single peregrine falcon found dead on 19 January.

"(' 6 February 2004 Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission in Viet Nam: new data are reassuring NB: Please see correction in update 20 WHO has today received the results from studies of two viruses taken from members of a family cluster of H5N1 infection in Viet Nam. The family cluster has been under investigationas the first possible instance of limited human- to-human transmission of the H5N1 avian influenza strain. Virus genetic materials from two fatal cases in this cluster – sisters aged 23 and 30 years – have now been fully sequenced by the Government Virus Unit of Hong Kong’s Department of Health. Both viruses are of avian origin and contain no human influenza genes. This finding, which indicates that the virus has not changed to a form easily transmitted from one person to another, is consistent with earlier findings from epidemiological investigations. No illness has been reported in other family members, in the local community, or in health workers involved in care of these patients. China (poultry) Chinese authorities have today confirmed H5N1 infection in poultry in an additional province. The H5N1 strain was detected in samples from infected chickens at two farms in the southern province of Jiangxi. Altogether, H5N1 infection in poultry is confirmed or suspected at farms in 13 of China’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. No cases of human H5N1 infection have been reported in China to date. ',)",0
"(' 9 February 2004 Situation (human) in Viet Nam Laboratory tests have confirmed an additional three cases of H5N1 in Viet Nam. All three cases were hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City. The newly confirmed cases are a 6-year-old child, who died on 3 February, a 24-year-old man, who died on 3 February, and a 23-year-old man, who remains hospitalized. Altogether, Viet Nam has reported 18 laboratory confirmed cases, 13 of which were fatal. Overview of the global situation: public health concerns – The outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry, currently reported in eight Asian countries, are historically unprecedented in their scale, geographical spread, and economic consequences for the agricultural sector. – The risk is great that the H5N1 strain has become endemic in poultry populations of this geographical area. – Infection in birds could spread to distant regions. – To date, human cases have been reported in only two countries, Viet Nam and Thailand, with very widespread outbreaks in poultry. – It can be anticipated that human cases will also be detected in other countries where outbreaks in poultry are spreading. – Evidence to date suggests that the H5N1 strain is not easily transmitted from poultry to humans. – Influenza viruses are genetically unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted. The present situation could change very quickly. – When a disease which affects an economically important sector of agriculture also poses a risk to human health, the risk to humans – however unpredictable – must not be minimized in the interest of maintaining consumer confidence. – Measures aimed at eliminating the disease in poultry also reduce opportunities for human exposures and infections. These measures must be carried out urgently, giving highest priority to the protection of human health. Correction On 6 February, WHO reported the results from genetic sequencing of H5N1 viruses taken from two sisters in a family cluster in Viet Nam. The sequencing announced Friday by WHO showed that the two viruses were both entirely of avian origin with no human genes, indicating the viruses had not become adapted to be easily transmitted from one human to another. Today, WHO has learned that the virus from only one sister has been sequenced, not both sisters. The second virus sequenced and reported was from another case in Viet Nam. The virus from the second sister is being sequenced this week. ',)",0
"(' 11 February 2004 Global surveillance guidelines WHO has today issued on its website guidelines for global surveillance aimed at monitoring the spread of H5N1 infection in human and animal populations. The guidelines include the definition of a laboratory-confirmed case of human H5N1 infection, and describe procedures for reporting cases to WHO. The guidelines also provide recommended procedures to monitor changes in transmission patterns and to detect potential human-to-human transmission. The guidelines are intended to improve global vigilance for the further spread of H5N1 infections in humans and animals, and for the first signs that human- to-human transmission may be occurring. Use of standardized procedures and reporting forms will improve the quality of information needed by WHO to advise on the most appropriate control measures. Situation (poultry) China Chinese authorities have announced a suspected outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza at a chicken farm in Tianjin. Spread to additional farms within several provinces has also been reported. Altogether, outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry are suspected or confirmed at 39 farms in 14 of the country’s provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. To date, no human cases have been reported in China. Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission: data on second sister in family cluster in Viet Nam WHO has today received the results from a study of virus isolated from a 23-year-old woman (see Updates 19 and 20) who is part of a family cluster in Viet Nam under investigation as the first possible instance of human-to-human transmission.

"(' 20 February 2004 Reports of infection in domestic cats (Thailand) WHO is aware of reports of H5N1 infection in a single household of domestic cats in Thailand. Investigations are under way and no firm conclusions can be made at present. However, concern is great and several specific questions are being raised about risks to humans in close contact with infected cats and the need for surveillance of disease in cat populations. H5N1 infection in two out of three dead domestic cats was announced today by the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences at Thailand’s Kasetsart University. The animals are part of a single household of 15 cats. Of these, 14 have died. Contact of one cat with dead chickens was observed by the owner. Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health is investigating the incident in cats and is monitoring the health of human contacts. FAO is also contributing expertise. While conclusions are premature pending the results of these investigations, confirmation of H5N1 infection in cats is not considered likely to enhance the present risks to human health. Nor is it considered likely to influence the future evolution of the outbreak in humans in any significant way. Several studies have shown that a small number of mammalian species, including pigs, seals, whales, mink, and ferrets, are susceptible to natural infection with influenza viruses that are purely avian in their genetic make-up. Of these species, only the pig has significance for human health. Pigs can be co- infected with both avian and human influenza viruses and can thus serve as the “mixing vessel” for the mingling of genetic material, possibly resulting in the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype. Most experts agree that pigs played a role in the emergence of pandemic viruses in 1957 and 1968. Up to now, domestic cats have not been considered susceptible to disease caused by natural infection with influenza viruses. Some older studies, from 1970, 1972, and 1981, reported experimental infection of domestic cats under laboratory conditions. Although infection occurred (virus was recovered from the respiratory tract), all of the cats remained healthy. None developed typical symptoms of influenza, including fever, nasal discharge, coughing or sneezing. These findings are important in that they strongly suggest that, should additional cats become infected with H5N1, they would not shed large quantities of the virus. In contrast, H5N1 virus replicates in the intestines as well as the respiratory tract of birds. In the present outbreak, very large quantities of virus are being excreted in the faeces of infected birds, resulting in widespread contamination of the environment. This wide presence of the H5N1 virus in the environment creates one of the most important risks for human exposure and subsequent infection. Should domestic cats prove to be easily infected with H5N1, which is considered unlikely, their infection is not expected to contribute in a significant way to the presence of H5N1 virus in the environment. Avian influenza viruses, including the specific strain implicated in the present outbreak, lack the receptors needed to infect mammals efficiently. However, the infection of humans observed in this and two previous H5N1 outbreaks demonstrates that transmission from birds to mammals can occur despite this lack of receptors. The very small number of human cases – despite abundant and widespread opportunities for exposure and subsequent infection – strongly suggests that transmission of H5N1 from birds to mammals, including cats as well as humans, is a rare event. The reported infection of domestic cats with H5N1 is an unusual event in what is an historically unprecedented situation. Results from the investigation undertaken by Thai authorities will shed critical light on this unusual event. Influenza viruses are highly unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted. Vigilance for suspected cases in various mammalian species is presently high and should be continued. Reporting by veterinarians of suspected or confirmed cases to national authorities, as happened in the present situation, is a key component of this continuing vigilance. WHO is collaborating closely with FAO and OIE as part of international efforts to understand the continuing evolution of the outbreaks in humans and animals, which are closely inter-related. Situation (human) in Thailand Since 23 January 2004, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has reported 9 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. Of these, seven have died. The situation is reviewed daily by a joint team of ministry officials and WHO staff. Preliminary epidemiological and clinical data on the first five cases were published last week by WHO. The subsequent four cases include two who have fully recovered (a 2-year old boy and a 27-year-old woman), a thirteen-year- old boy, and a four-year-old boy, who died on 3 February. All cases have been announced in previous updates. Thai authorities are currently investigating a further 147 reports of patients admitted to hospital with suspicious symptoms. Of these, 21 are being considered as suspect cases of H5N1 infection. All have a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Eight have died, 8 have fully recovered, and 5 remain hospitalized. The investigation of cases is following three lines: laboratory testing, epidemiological tracing of likely sources of infection, and examination of clinical features of disease. Final results of laboratory testing are pending for the additional 126 patients under investigation. The results of virus isolation studies are pending. These studies, which can take up to 14 days, are used to verify and supplement the initial PCR findings. Recent enhancement of laboratory facilities at Thailand’s National Institutes of Health, including the addition of equipment for reverse transcriptase PCR testing, has expedited the processing of clinical samples, thus reducing the time from notification to obtaining the initial laboratory diagnosis. In this group of 126 patients, 19 are still being investigated to obtain more details about either potential exposure to affected poultry or the clinical features of disease. The surveillance system in Thailand is on high alert. To date, 510 reports have been brought to the attention of health authorities. Of these, 354 have been excluded from consideration following thorough laboratory, epidemiological, and clinical investigation. The most recently announced confirmed case was a four-year-old boy from the northeastern province of Khon Kaen. His family raised chickens, and many died shortly before the onset of his symptoms. One of the most recently reported suspect cases is a two-year-old girl from a southern province. The family’s poultry died 7 days prior to the onset of her symptoms. The case is not yet laboratory confirmed. As H5N1 infection in poultry has not been reported in this province to date, the Ministry of Agriculture has been informed and is currently investigating animal illness in the area. To date, no evidence suggests that human-to-human transmission has occurred in Thailand. The number of reports brought to the attention of Thai authorities has declined and the numbers this week are low. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently responding to the detection, earlier this week, of the reappearance of infection in poultry in provinces where extensive culling was previously carried out. Rapid culling in the newly affected areas is now under way to prevent further spread, and thus reduce opportunities for the disease to become endemic. Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health, with the full support of WHO, is stressing the need for continued vigilance and intensive surveillance. Situation (poultry) in Japan Japanese authorities have confirmed that the country’s second outbreak of avian influenza, detected in Oita Prefecture, is caused by the H5N1 strain. Situation (poultry) in China As of today, Chinese authorities have reported 53 outbreaks in poultry in 16 provinces. Of these, 49 have been confirmed as caused by H5N1.

Several studies have shown that a small number of mammalian species, including pigs, seals, whales, mink, and ferrets, are susceptible to natural infection with influenza viruses that are purely avian in their genetic make-up. Of these species, only the pig has significance for human health. Pigs can be co- infected with both avian and human influenza viruses and can thus serve as the “mixing vessel” for the mingling of genetic material, possibly resulting in the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype. Most experts agree that pigs played a role in the emergence of pandemic viruses in 1957 and 1968. Up to now, domestic cats have not been considered susceptible to disease caused by natural infection with influenza viruses. Some older studies, from 1970, 1972, and 1981, reported experimental infection of domestic cats under laboratory conditions. Although infection occurred (virus was recovered from the respiratory tract), all of the cats remained healthy. None developed typical symptoms of influenza, including fever, nasal discharge, coughing or sneezing. These findings are important in that they strongly suggest that, should additional cats become infected with H5N1, they would not shed large quantities of the virus. In contrast, H5N1 virus replicates in the intestines as well as the respiratory tract of birds. In the present outbreak, very large quantities of virus are being excreted in the faeces of infected birds, resulting in widespread contamination of the environment. This wide presence of the H5N1 virus in the environment creates one of the most important risks for human exposure and subsequent infection. Should domestic cats prove to be easily infected with H5N1, which is considered unlikely, their infection is not expected to contribute in a significant way to the presence of H5N1 virus in the environment. Avian influenza viruses, including the specific strain implicated in the present outbreak, lack the receptors needed to infect mammals efficiently. However, the infection of humans observed in this and two previous H5N1 outbreaks demonstrates that transmission from birds to mammals can occur despite this lack of receptors. The very small number of human cases – despite abundant and widespread opportunities for exposure and subsequent infection – strongly suggests that transmission of H5N1 from birds to mammals, including cats as well as humans, is a rare event. The reported infection of domestic cats with H5N1 is an unusual event in what is an historically unprecedented situation. Results from the investigation undertaken by Thai authorities will shed critical light on this unusual event. Influenza viruses are highly unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted. Vigilance for suspected cases in various mammalian species is presently high and should be continued. Reporting by veterinarians of suspected or confirmed cases to national authorities, as happened in the present situation, is a key component of this continuing vigilance. WHO is collaborating closely with FAO and OIE as part of international efforts to understand the continuing evolution of the outbreaks in humans and animals, which are closely inter-related. Situation (human) in Thailand Since 23 January 2004, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has reported 9 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. Of these, seven have died. The situation is reviewed daily by a joint team of ministry officials and WHO staff. Preliminary epidemiological and clinical data on the first five cases were published last week by WHO. The subsequent four cases include two who have fully recovered (a 2-year old boy and a 27-year-old woman), a thirteen-year- old boy, and a four-year-old boy, who died on 3 February. All cases have been announced in previous updates. Thai authorities are currently investigating a further 147 reports of patients admitted to hospital with suspicious symptoms. Of these, 21 are being considered as suspect cases of H5N1 infection. All have a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Eight have died, 8 have fully recovered, and 5 remain hospitalized. The investigation of cases is following three lines: laboratory testing, epidemiological tracing of likely sources of infection, and examination of clinical features of disease. Final results of laboratory testing are pending for the additional 126 patients under investigation. The results of virus isolation studies are pending. These studies, which can take up to 14 days, are used to verify and supplement the initial PCR findings. Recent enhancement of laboratory facilities at Thailand’s National Institutes of Health, including the addition of equipment for reverse transcriptase PCR testing, has expedited the processing of clinical samples, thus reducing the time from notification to obtaining the initial laboratory diagnosis. In this group of 126 patients, 19 are still being investigated to obtain more details about either potential exposure to affected poultry or the clinical features of disease. The surveillance system in Thailand is on high alert. To date, 510 reports have been brought to the attention of health authorities. Of these, 354 have been excluded from consideration following thorough laboratory, epidemiological, and clinical investigation. The most recently announced confirmed case was a four-year-old boy from the northeastern province of Khon Kaen. His family raised chickens, and many died shortly before the onset of his symptoms. One of the most recently reported suspect cases is a two-year-old girl from a southern province. The family’s poultry died 7 days prior to the onset of her symptoms. The case is not yet laboratory confirmed. As H5N1 infection in poultry has not been reported in this province to date, the Ministry of Agriculture has been informed and is currently investigating animal illness in the area. To date, no evidence suggests that human-to-human transmission has occurred in Thailand. The number of reports brought to the attention of Thai authorities has declined and the numbers this week are low. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently responding to the detection, earlier this week, of the reappearance of infection in poultry in provinces where extensive culling was previously carried out. Rapid culling in the newly affected areas is now under way to prevent further spread, and thus reduce opportunities for the disease to become endemic. Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health, with the full support of WHO, is stressing the need for continued vigilance and intensive surveillance. Situation (poultry) in Japan Japanese authorities have confirmed that the country’s second outbreak of avian influenza, detected in Oita Prefecture, is caused by the H5N1 strain. Situation (poultry) in China As of today, Chinese authorities have reported 53 outbreaks in poultry in 16 provinces. Of these, 49 have been confirmed as caused by H5N1.

"(' 2 March 2004 During last week’s emergency meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, officials from FAO, OIE, and WHO drew attention to several unique features of the current outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia, in particular its geographical distribution, rate of spread and severity of which are unprecedented. Prospects for rapid control are inconsistent with worldwide experience, over more than four decades, with previous outbreaks, which have all been much smaller in scope and inherently less challenging. Even in countries with good surveillance, adequate resources, and geographically limited outbreaks, control has often taken up to two years. For these reasons and others, WHO has cautioned against assumptions that the outbreaks can be controlled in the immediate future. WHO has described the serious public health implications of these outbreaks in a previous update. Up to the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was considered a rare disease. Since 1959, only 21 Outbreakshad been reported worldwide. The majority occurred in Europe and the Americas. Of the total, only five resulted in significant spread to numerous farms, and only one was associated with spread to other countries. Since mid-December 2003, eight Asian countries have confirmed outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by the H5N1 strain. Most of these countries are experiencing outbreaks of this disease for the first time in their histories. In several, outbreaks have been detected in virtually every part of the country Over the past two months, more than 100 million birds have either died of the disease or been culled in Asia. This figure is greater than the total number of poultry affected, over years, in the world’s previous five largest outbreaks combined. Worldwide experience since 1959 supports official statements about the unprecedented nature of the present situation and the challenges for control. Unique features in the present situation include: \\- Concentration of poultry in backyard farms.In several countries experiencing outbreaks, up to 80% of poultry are produced on small farms and backyard holdings in rural areas, where poultry range freely. In China, 60% of the country’s esitmated 13.2 billion chickens are raised on small farms in close proximity to humans and domestic animals, including pigs. This situation makes implementation of strict control measures, essential to the control of previous outbreaks, extremely difficult. These control measures – including bird-proof, ecologically controlled housing, treatment of water supplies, disinfection of all incoming persons, equipment, and vehicles, prevention of contact with insects, rodents, and other mechanical vectors – cannot be applied on small rural farms and backyard holdings. – Economic significance of poultry production. Poultry production contributes greatly to the economies and food supplies of affected countries. The agricultural sector faces the challenge of minimizing losses to industry and subsistence farmers in ways that also reduce health risks for humans. Because many people in the region are so dependent on poultry, appropriate culling may be difficult to implement. – Lack of control experience. Since the disease is new to most countries in the region, very little experience exists at national and international levels to guide the best country-specific control measures. In some countries, announcements of successful culling in certain areas are being followed by subsequent eruptions of disease in the same areas, suggesting reintroduction of the virus, continuing presence in the environment, or inadequate verification of outbreak control. – Lack of resources. Several countries with very widespread outbreaks lack adequate infrastructure and resources, including resources to compensate farmers and thus encourage compliance with government recommendations. In some countries that have announced outbreaks, neither surveillance to detect the extent of spread nor culling of animals known to be infected is taking place. – The scale of international spread. With so many adjacent countries affected, a region-wide strategy will be needed to ensure that gains in one country are not compromised by inadequate control in another. These unique features will make rapid control and long-term prevention of recurrence extremely difficult to achieve. Culling remains the first line of action, as recommended by FAO, OIE, and WHO, for bringing the current outbreaks under control. Unlike other economically important domestic animals, poultry raising takes place in a very short production system. Provided sufficient resources are available to replace culled poultry stock, countries should not postpone aggressive culling because of fears of long-term consequences on poultry production. Wild birds can play a role in introducing a virus of low pathogenicity into domestic flocks where, if allowed to circulate for several months, it can mutate into a highly pathogenic form. No evidence to date indicates that wild birds are the source of the present outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. Wild birds should not be culled. Previous outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza worldwide Year Country/area Domestic birds affected Strain 1959 Scotland chicken H5N1 1963 England turkey H7N3 1966 Ontario (Canada) turkey H5N9 1976 Victoria (Australia) chicken H7N7 1979 Germany chicken H7N7 1979 England turkey H7N7 1983\x961985 Pennsylvania (USA)* chicken, turkey H5N2 1983 Ireland turkey H5N8 1985 Victoria (Australia) chicken H7N7 1991 England turkey H5N1 1992 Victoria (Australia) chicken H7N3 1994 Queensland (Australia) chicken H7N3 1994\x961995 Mexico* chicken H5N2 1994 Pakistan* chicken H7N3 1997 New South Wales (Australia) chicken H7N4 1997 Hong Kong (China)* chicken H5N1 1997 Italy chicken H5N2 1999\x962000 Italy* turkey H7N1 2002 Hong Kong (China) chicken H5N1 2002 Chile chicken H7N3 2003 Netherlands* chicken H7N7 *Outbreaks with significant spread to numerous farms, resulting in great economic losses. Most other outbreaks involved little or no spread from the initially infected farms. Observations from previous outbreaks (1959–2003) Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza can be extremely difficult to control, even under favourable conditions (concentration of infected birds in well-maintained commercial production facilities, limited geographical occurrence). – The 1983 Pennsylvania (USA) outbreak took two years to control. Some 17 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of US$62 million. Indirect costs have been estimated at more than US$250 million. – The 2003 outbreak in the Netherlands spread to Belgium and Germany. In the Netherlands, more than 30 million birds - a quarter of the country’s poultry stock – were destroyed. Some 2.7 million were destroyed in Belgium, and around 400,000 in Germany. In the Netherlands, 89 humans were infected, of whom one (a veterinarian) died. In that outbreak, measures needed to protect the health of poultry workers, farmers, and persons visiting farms included wearing of protective clothing, masks to cover the mouth and nose, eye protection, vaccination against normal seasonal human influenza, and administration of prophylactic antiviral drugs. Control is even more difficult in countries with dense poultry populations. – The Italian outbreak of 1999–2000 caused infection in 413 flocks, including 25 backyard flocks, and resulted in the destruction of around 14 million birds. Control was complicated by the occurrence of cases in areas with extremely dense poultry populations. Compensation to farmers amounted to US$63 million. Costs for the poultry and associated industry have been estimated at US$620 million. Four months after the last outbreak ended, the virus returned in a low-pathogenic form, rapidly causing a further 52 outbreaks. – Although the last outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Mexico occurred in 1995, the causative agent – the H5N2 strain – has never been entirely eliminated from the country, in its present low-pathogenicity form, despite years of intense efforts, including the administration of more than 2 billion doses of vaccines of varying efficacy. Similarly, the vaccination policy pursued in Pakistan does not appear to have resulted in eradication of the causative agent. Avoidance of contact between poultry and wild birds, especially ducks and other waterfowl, can help prevent the introduction of a low-pathogenicity virus into domestic flocks. Although no evidence to date has conclusively linked the current outbreaks with wild migratory birds in Asia: – Several of these outbreaks have been linked to contact between free-ranging flocks and wild birds, including the shared use of water sources. Faecal contamination of water supplies is considered a very efficient way for waterfowl to transmit the virus. Virus (low-pathogenicity) has been readily recovered from lakes and ponds where migratory birds congregate. – An especially risky practice is the raising of small numbers of domestic ducks on a pond in proximity to domestic chicken and turkey flocks. Domestic ducks attract wild ducks, and provide a significant link in the chain of transmission from wild birds to domestic flocks. Aggressive control measures, including culling of infected and exposed poultry, are recommended for avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7 even when the virus initially shows low pathogenicity. (H5 and H7 are the only subtypes implicated in outbreaks of highly pathogenic disease.) – Several of the largest outbreaks (Pennsylvania, Mexico, Italy) initially began with mild illness in poultry. When the virus was allowed to continue circulating in poultry, it eventually mutated (within 6 to 9 months) into a highly pathogenic form with a mortality ratio approaching 100%. Moreover, the initial presence of low-pathogenicity virus in these outbreaks complicated diagnosis of the highly pathogenic form. ',)",0

"("" 5 April 2004 The first human case of avian influenza A(H7) in British Columbia occurred in a person who was involved in culling of infected birds on 13-14 March. On 13 March, he may have been accidentally exposed in the eye. On 16 March, the individual reported conjunctivitis and nasal discharge. Treatment with oseltamavir, an antiviral drug active against influenza A viruses, began on 18 March. On 30 March, Health Canada concluded that this case was caused by avian influenza A(H7). Health Canada informed WHO of this case on 31 March. The patient's symptoms have fully resolved. On 2 April, WHO was informed by Health Canada of a second poultry worker in British Columbia identified with avian influenza A(H7). This worker developed conjunctivitis in March 25 after close contact with infected birds. He was treated with oseltamivir on 25 March and his symptoms resolved. Based on this epidemiological information provided by Health Canada, the World Health Organization today raised the global pandemic preparedness level from 0.1 to 0.2 for the Canadian outbreak. Global pandemic preparedness levels are dictated by the epidemiological situation for each local event. Level 0.2 means that more than one human case caused by a new subtype of influenza virus has been identified in the local event. In Asia, another avian influenza virus, A(H5N1), has been responsible for 34 reported human illnesses and 23 deaths. The existing global preparedness level of 0.2 for the avian influenza in Asia remains unchanged. Preparedness levels have been organized into a matrix established by WHO in 1999(WHO Influenza Pandemic Preparedness plan). When a preparedness level is raised to 0.2, affected countries are advised to step up their surveillance in persons exposed to affected poultry, to organize special investigations to better understand the new virus, to advise persons at risk to wear protected clothing, and to consider the use of antivirals and normal human influenza vaccine. WHO has been informed that Canada has taken all required actions in response to the current avian influenza A(H7) outbreak in British Columbia.

"(' 22 April 2004 The Chinese Ministry of Health has today informed WHO of one suspected case of SARS.

As her condition did not improve, she was transferred on 14 April to a second Beijing hospital, where she was placed in intensive care. Results of initial blood tests, received today, indicate a likely infection with the SARS coronavirus. However, further testing is needed before a diagnosis of SARS can be confirmed. Contact tracing has identified 171 contacts, who have been placed under observation. Of these, five have developed fever. If confirmed, this will be the first case of SARS since January this year, when authorities in Guangdong Province confirmed infection in a 35-year-old businessman and a 20-year-old waitress.

"(' 23 April 2004 The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported an additional three cases of SARS, including one death. This brings the current number of persons with a clinical illness compatible with SARS in China to four. Chinese authorities have reported a diagnosis of clinically confirmed SARS coronavirus infection in two of these persons. These are the 20-year-old nurse in Beijing, reported yesterday, who remains in intensive care, and a 26-year- old female laboratory researcher, from Anhui Province. During two weeks in March, the researcher worked at the Chinese National Institute of Virology in Beijing, which is part of China’s Center for Disease Control. This institute is known to be engaged in research involving the SARS coronavirus. She developed symptoms on 25 March and was attended, while in a Beijing hospital, by the nurse. Her mother also provided bedside care. The mother became ill in Anhui on 8 April and died on 19 April. Her clinical symptoms were compatible with SARS, and health authorities have retrospectively diagnosed her as a suspected SARS case. The fourth person is a 31-year-old male laboratory researcher who also worked at the Beijing virology institute. He developed symptoms on 17 April and was hospitalized in isolation on 22 April.

"(' 26 April 2004 At the request of the Chinese Ministry of Health, WHO is today sending the first members of an international team to help investigate the source of SARS cases recently reported in Beijing and the eastern province of Anhui. The team, which is expected to begin work on Wednesday, will include experts in epidemiology, virology, infection control, and laboratory biosafety. Results of investigations to date point to laboratory research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing as the likely source of the outbreak. The institute has been engaged in research with the SARS coronavirus, including the development of a vaccine. Two of the recently reported cases were conducting research at the laboratory: a 26-year-old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province, and a 31-year- old man. The dates of symptom onset in the two cases are widely separated (23 days), suggesting that more than one opportunity for exposure may have occurred in the laboratory from mid-March through early April. Authorities have closed the virology institute and placed its more than 200 employees under medical observation. Numerous environmental samples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources of contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO. Understanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in bringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to quickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid case detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in hospitals. WHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have already occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several different hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of adequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict procedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance twice by train within China while symptomatic. Chinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for SARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative teams to Anhui Province. Since 22 April, China has reported that eight persons have been clinically diagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS infection. Six of these are in Beijing and two, including the single fatality, are in Anhui Province. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under medical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui. The most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are four close contacts of a 20-year-old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The cases – all in Beijing – are currently under investigation. They include the nurse’s mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward with the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all four persons occurred between 16 and 19 April. The nurse’s mother is in serious condition following the development of pneumonia. The other three persons are in stable condition. In addition, health authorities have reported that two doctors who treated the postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have developed fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also developed fever. To date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked to chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an identified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community. According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS, classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires independent verification of results by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public health. ',)",8
"(' 28 April 2004 Chinese health authorities have today announced that an additional case of SARS is under investigation. This brings the total number of cases in China, reported since 22 April, to nine. Of these, one has died. The new case, in Beijing, is a 49-year-old female retired doctor. On 12 April, she was admitted to the same hospital ward where a 20-year-old nurse was being treated for pneumonia. The former doctor began developing SARS-like symptoms on 19 April and on 22 April was transferred to Ditan Hospital and placed in isolation. Her condition is listed as critical. The 20-year-old nurse, previously reported to WHO as a confirmed case, has been linked to an additional five cases. These include the one reported today and four reported on Sunday. To date, all cases have been linked to chains of transmission involving close contact with an identified case. The second confirmed case, who remains hospitalized in Anhui Province, is a 26-year-old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. She is thought to be the index case in the present outbreak. During the 2003 outbreak, the transmission of SARS was greatly amplified in hospital settings. As a risk reduction strategy in Beijing, all seven SARS cases are now being treated in Ditan Hospital. However, patients were treated or assessed in open wards at seven hospitals (five in Beijing and 2 in Anhui) before suspicions of SARS were raised and procedures of isolation and infection control were introduced. In addition, the two patients in Anhui travelled long distances within China by train. As these events created opportunities for multiple exposures, Chinese authorities have undertaken extensive tracing and follow-up of contacts. In Beijing, nearly 700 persons have been isolated or placed in quarantine. The maximum incubation period for SARS is generally accepted to be 10 days. Based on present knowledge about the disease, persons exposed to the virus are not infectious prior to the onset of symptoms. For these reasons, rapid detection and isolation of cases, and rapid tracing and follow-up of contacts have been successfully used to bring a SARS outbreak under control. Investigation of the outbreak Following a request by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the initial members of a WHO team are now in Beijing to assist in the investigation and control of the outbreaks there and in Anhui. Investigation of the source of infection will initially focus on biosafety procedures at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. Two of the nine cases reported by China, including the earliest case, were researchers at the institute, which has been conducting work using the live SARS coronavirus. Chinese authorities are providing WHO with detailed clinical and epidemiological information on all cases. This information is important in assessing the severity of illness caused by the virus and the extent of its transmission. Of the 8 patients currently hospitalized for treatment, the patient in Anhui Province continues to improve. In Beijing, two patients are in critical condition and the others remain under treatment for pneumonia. If the source of infection is determined to come from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing, this will be the first SARS outbreak caused by a laboratory-acquired virus, which could possibly cause different patterns of illness and transmission. Previous laboratory-associated cases – a single case each in Singapore in September 2003 and in Taiwan, China in December 2003 – did not result in any further transmission. Both cases fully recovered. In addition, four cases (3 confirmed and 1 probable) were reported in Guangdong Province in December 2003 and January 2004, presumably acquired from an environmental source. Unlike the present outbreak, these cases were associated with mild illness only and did not result in secondary transmission to others. ',)",9
"(' 29 April 2004 The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported diagnostic confirmation of SARS infection in two patients previously under investigation in Beijing. Confirmation is based on the results of laboratory tests, clinical symptoms, and a history of close contact with a known case. Both patients are relatives – the mother and an aunt – of a 20-year-old nurse who treated what is thought to be the index case in the outbreak. The nurse subsequently developed respiratory symptoms and was hospitalized on 7 April. She was visited the next day by family members, including the mother and aunt. The 44-year-old mother is now in critical condition. The 36-year-old aunt, who was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia earlier this week, remains in stable condition. Both patients are part of a third generation of cases that includes the nurse’s father and two other patients hospitalized on the same ward, including one patient who shared a room with the nurse. The number of SARS cases either clinically confirmed or under investigation remains nine: seven in Beijing and two (including the single fatality) in Anhui Province. In Beijing, all seven SARS cases are now being treated in isolation at Ditan Hospital. This is a risk reduction strategy aimed at preventing further spread through the hospital system. According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS, classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires independent verification of results by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public health. ',)",9
"(' 30 April 2004 Chinese authorities have today reported test results confirming that the 53-year-old woman who died in Anhui Province on 19 April was infected with the SARS coronavirus. The woman, a medical doctor, was the mother of a 26-year-old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. The student remains hospitalized in Anhui. Since the first case was reported on 22 April, Chinese authorities have confirmed a diagnosis of SARS in five persons (see summary below). Testing continues on another four patients who have SARS-like symptoms and a history of close contact with a known case. Since 22 April, the seven patients in Beijing are now being treated in isolation in a single facility, Ditan Hospital, as a risk reduction strategy. Investigation of the source of the outbreak is presently focused on lapses in biosafety procedures at the National Institute of Virology. The institute was closed on 23 April and its staff were placed in isolation. Summary of cases To date, there have been three generations resulting in nine cases. First generation. The first case is a 26-year-old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province. She worked at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing 7–22 March. Laboratories at the institute are known to be conducting studies using the live SARS coronavirus. Her symptoms developed on 25 March in Anhui. Following onset of symptoms, she travelled twice by train from Anhui to Beijing and back to Anhui. Her SARS infection has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. She is presently hospitalized in isolation in Anhui. A second case who may have acquired infection from a laboratory source is a 31-year-old male researcher at the same virology institute. His symptoms developed on 17 April. He is presently undergoing treatment in isolation at Beijing’s Ditan Hospital. To date, he has not been linked to any other cases. Second generation. The two cases in the second generation are both linked to close personal contact with the postgraduate student. These cases are her 53-year-old mother, whose infection with the SARS coronavirus was confirmed by Chinese authorities today. She is, to date, the only fatal case in the outbreak. The second case is a 20-year-old nurse in Beijing who treated the postgraduate student, from 29 March to 2 April, during her initial hospitalization in Beijing The nurse’s SARS infection has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. She is being treated in isolation at Beijing’s Ditan Hospital. Third generation. Five further cases have all been linked to close contact with the nurse. Three are relatives: her 45-year-old father, her 44-year-old mother, and a 36-year-old aunt. SARS infection in the mother and aunt has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. The fourth case linked to the nurse is a 49-year-old retired female doctor who was admitted to hospital because of another illness and shared a room with the nurse. The retired doctor’s 23-year-old daughter-in-law, who accompanied her at the time of hospital admission, is the fifth case. As both women did not develop SARS-like symptoms until a week following hospital admission, both are presumed to have acquired their infection from close contact with the nurse. All five patients are being treated in isolation at Ditan Hospital. ',)",9

"("" 8 July 2004 Avian influenza home page In the last two weeks, avian influenza appears to have re-emerged in poultry in several countries in Asia. These outbreaks could either be new outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus or a continuation of the outbreaks first reported earlier in the year. These events, in addition to two new research reports -- about the virus becoming increasingly pathogenic and becoming more widespread in birds in the region -- fuel the World Health Organization's concern about the threat the virus poses to human health. WHO has been concerned about this virus, influenza A(H5N1), because of its threat to humans both in farm settings in Asia and its greater, potentially global risk. Several countries in Asia have witnessed this virus crossing the species barrier, moving from infected chickens or ducks directly into humans in three documented outbreaks since 1997. These direct human infections have produced severe and sometimes fatal outcomes. Moreover, the virus has the potential to acquire the ability to spread easily from human to human, and thus, trigger a global influenza pandemic. Now, two research reports have added to our understanding of this virus. First, members of China's Ministry of Agriculture and colleagues reported in a paper published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the virus appears to be widespread in domestic ducks in southern China. Further, the scientists found that the virus is causing increasingly severe disease. However, these trials were done in mice and may not have a direct implication for humans. This week, the journal Nature published a report which indicates domestic and wild birds in the region may have contributed to the increasing spread of the virus and suggests that the virus is gaining a stronger foothold in the region. These observations suggest that control of the virus may be even more difficult than thought in the spring. Effective risk management tools exist to control outbreaks of influenza A(H5N1) when they are detected in poultry operations. China, for example, was quick to employ these tools last week when an outbreak was discovered in Anhui province. These risk management measures include the culling of infected and exposed birds, stringent biosecurity measures and vaccination. While this approach can still take months or even years to contain the virus completely, these methods have been effective in the past. However, tools to assess the risk to human health are less well developed. While recent reports indicate the virus has been present consistently in the environment for the last several years, it has still not acquired the ability to infect humans easily. Why? Is there something about this virus which resists this development? Given the recent reports, WHO urges and offers assistance that such risk assessment activities, including surveillance in animals and humans, and strain analysis, be undertaken as soon as possible. More knowledge of the virus could be acquired if WHO had full access to all virus isolates and clinical specimens from recent outbreaks. All H5N1 viruses are not the same, and how they differ could provide important insights. For example, the work reported in Nature suggests that the Indonesian avian influenza virus, while belonging to the genotype of viruses seen in Viet Nam and Thailand, is also distinct. What, if any, impact does this difference have? With this information, public health planners would know that they are confronting the same virus in all of the recent outbreaks in Asia. This is another set of the many questions that need to be answered imperatively. Pandemic preparedness activities started by WHO in the wake of the outbreaks reported earlier this year continue. Less than two weeks ago, WHO hosted a meeting in Kuala Lumpur with experts from 13 countries and areas of the Asia- Pacific region. Among other activities, the meeting participants were provided with a WHO preparedness self-assessment tool. WHO is collaborating with scientists and the pharmaceutical community on a global surveillance system to monitor changes in the virus's susceptibility to known antivirals. Finally, pandemic vaccine development continues. Two vaccine manufacturers, both based in the United States, have produced a supply of trial vaccine which will be tested for safety and efficacy in humans. In summary, recent developments suggest that: • the virus is more widespread than previously thought and found in wild birds, and therefore it may be more difficult to eliminate. • virus isolates and specimens from all recent outbreaks need to be shared with the WHO laboratory network to monitor the circulating viruses and to assess the adequacy of the current pandemic vaccine strain. • as control measures are strengthened, national governments are encouraged to provide human influenza vaccinations to culling workers. • all people, especially culling workers, exposed to infected birds need to be provided with antivirals. • human trials of experimental influenza pandemic vaccines should be accelerated. • while early identification of avian influenza cases in humans is difficult, stepped up surveillance for the early detection of the disease in humans is essential. The risk of emergence of a new human pandemic virus will remain as long as the avian influenza virus exists in the environment. WHO's concern and activities continue at a high level following recent reports. Because the H5N1 threat is unlikely to be resolved in the shortterm, WHO is working with other international agencies, including the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), to monitor events.

"("" 16 July 2004 WHO continues to be concerned by the simultaneous outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in several Asian countries. * Avian influenza - Current evaluation of risks to humans from H5N1 following recent reports While these outbreaks thus far remain restricted to poultry populations, they nevertheless increase the chances of virus transmission and human infection of the disease, as well as the possible emergence of a new influenza virus strain capable of sparking a global pandemic. In this context, WHO re-emphasizes the necessity of protecting individuals involved in the culling of H5N1-infected poultry. Workers who might be exposed to H5N1-infected poultry should have proper personal protective equipment (i.e. protective clothing, masks and goggles) since there is a high risk of exposure during the slaughtering process. In addition to the use of personal protective equipment, WHO is recommending: * To avoid the co-infection of avian and human influenza, which could allow for the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus, all persons involved in mass culling operations, transportation and burial/incineration of carcasses should be vaccinated with the current WHO-recommended influenza vaccine. * All persons exposed to infected poultry or to farms under suspicion should be under close monitoring by local health authorities. National authorities should also increase their surveillance of any reported clusters of influenza or influenza-like illness. * Antiviral treatment should be available on an on-going basis for treatment of a suspected human infection with a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus. If antivirals are available in sufficient quantities, prophylactic use should be considered. Please see the full list of WHO's interim recommendations for the protection of persons involved in the mass slaughter of animals potentially infected with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza viruses. WHO is also urging countries to work on standardized procedures for immediate sharing of all avian influenza virus strains responsible for outbreaks with WHO's international network of laboratories WHO is depending on the continued collaboration of the national health and agricultural services to establish routine procedures for immediate sharing of avian influenza virus samples. Without such virus samples, WHO will not be in a position to provide proper vaccine prototype strains and related guidance for vaccine producers. "",)",0
"("" 30 July 2004 After a period of quiescence in Southeast Asia, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (A/H5N1) are again being reported in chickens and ducks in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Thailand, outbreaks have been reported in 21 of 76 provinces; and in Viet Nam outbreaks were reported in the northern, central and southern parts of the country. These outbreaks, many without apparent epidemiological links to each other, suggest A/H5N1 is now widely prevalent and is very likely to have become endemic. The outbreaks in birds pose a significant threat to human health. As WHO has stated since the first A/H5N1 outbreaks were reported, this virus has the potential to ignite a global influenza pandemic in humans. In a number of these outbreaks since the beginning of 2004, the virus has jumped from infected chickens or ducks directly to humans. These direct human infections have produced severe and sometimes fatal outcomes. WHO's continuing concern is that this virus may reassort its genes with those from a human influenza virus, thereby acquiring the ability to move easily from human to human and thus triggering a pandemic. Recent media reports have occasionally suggested the presence of new human cases of A/H5N1. WHO has received no information substantiating these reports. At a meeting in Bangkok which ended today, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in association with the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and WHO, announced plans to launch a new regional veterinary influenza network. WHO welcomes this initiative as this network aims to strengthen surveillance in animals and should provide more rapid diagnosis of the disease. The FAO/OIE regional animal laboratory network will closely link with the WHO's global influenza programme to allow for more rapid sharing of virus samples. Faster and broader sharing of samples will enable WHO to monitor for changes in the virus which could diminish the effectiveness of the human vaccine currently under development. To date, such sample exchanges have been retarded in some affected countries. The risk of emergence of a new human pandemic virus will remain as long as the avian influenza virus exists in the environment. Without significant increase in control efforts at national and international levels, it may be years before the virus is eradicated. While these control efforts continue, WHO reemphasizes the need to monitor the health of people on these front lines. Thus, WHO-coordinated preparedness activities will continue and WHO encourages members states to start or continue with their own influenza pandemic preparedness plans. "",)",0
"(' 7 August 2004 Press release Geneva \\- Today marks the 42nd day since the last person identified as infected with Ebola haemorrhagic fever died on 26 June 2004 in Yambio Hospital, southern Sudan. As 42 days is twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola, and as no further cases have been identified, WHO declares today that the outbreak in southern Sudan is over. ""The rapid containment of this outbreak was a tremendous success for the health authorities, WHO, and the international community involved in the control operations,"" said Dr Abdullah Ahmed, head of WHO, southern Sudan, and coordinator of the response. As of today, the health authorities of Yambio County have reported a total of 17 cases, including seven deaths from Ebola. Ebola haemorrhagic fever is a febrile illness which causes death in 50-90% of all clinically ill cases. It is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or bodily fluids of infected persons. ""In Yambio, WHO and our partners were able to apply lessons learned during responses to the five Ebola outbreaks that have occurred since 2000,"" said Dr Pierre Formenty, who worked as part of WHO\'s response team. Ebola outbreaks have been detected more frequently in recent years, making local and international collaboration essential. During this outbreak, Ebola virus (sub-type Sudan) was confirmed by laboratory tests at the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. When the outbreak was first reported in late May, a response team including members from WHO southern Sudan Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN), and WHO headquarters was formed to work with local health authorities in creating a Crisis Committee to control the outbreak. The committee included UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières-France and other non- governmental organizations and churches working in public health. The international response to the outbreak also included partners from WHO\'s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) as well as experts from the CDC, the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training, Field Epidemiology Training Programme, Egypt and the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom. Intensive social mobilization for Ebola was essential to the outbreak\'s containment. Key messages about the disease and behaviour-specific precautionary advice were passed on to the people in and around Yambio by local community advocates. ""Once the people of Yambio were convinced of the very real risks Ebola posed and they understood what they could do to protect themselves and their families the outbreak response was greatly accelerated,"" said Ms Asiya Odugleh from the WHO Mediterranean Centre for Vulnerability Reduction, Tunis, who assisted the county social mobilization team. The control efforts included, for example, an isolation ward at Yambio Hospital with a low fence so that patients were effectively isolated, yet still able to see and talk to their family and friends over the fence at a safe distance. Such simple adaptations of disease control measures made it easier for families to accept the case management of patients in the isolation unit, while ensuring maximum protection for the medical team and patients. ""The lessons we learned in Yambio from this outbreak will strengthen our responses to future outbreaks,"" said Dr Hassan El Bushra from the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Cairo. The Yambio experience has proven the value of rapid outbreak detection, local response capacities, active community involvement, and the coordination of specialized international assistance to the outbreak\'s containment. ""WHO cannot predict where or when the next Ebola outbreak will happen,"" said Dr El Bushra, ""But we can continue laying the groundwork by building on what we have learned in Yambio."" ### Related story * * * ',)",17
"(' 10 August 2004 Between May 22 and July 30 2004, a total of 625 cases and 22 deaths from acute jaundice syndrome were reported from health clinics in the Greater Darfur region in Sudan. These cases were identified through the early warning alert and response system (EWAR) developed by WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other agencies. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was confirmed by ELISA in 23 samples tested at the NAMRU3 laboratory in Cairo, Egypt. Suspected hepatitis cases have been reported from East, North and West Darfur but the highest incidence to date has been recorded in Morni IDP camp, West Darfur. From a preliminary analysis of epidemiological data from the Morni IDP camp, a total of 149 cases and 8 deaths has been reported. 70% of the cases are female and the mean age is 24 years. Of the 8 deaths reported, 6 of them (75%) have occurred in pregnant women. HEV is a waterborne disease usually transmitted by faecally contaminated water that can provoke major outbreaks in settings with poor sanitation. Refugees and IDPs residing in overcrowded camps are at highest risk of disease. Case fatality rates can vary from 1 to 4%, but may be as high as 20% in pregnant women who are more susceptible to severe forms of the disease. This outbreak is a consequence of the inadequate and unsafe water supply and poor sanitary conditions the Darfur population has experienced during this crisis. Despite important efforts by international organizations, existing resources are insufficient to cover the basic needs of the IDPs. Without an immediate improvement in access to safe, clean water and better sanitation in these camps, the disease could spread rapidly and lead to increased mortality. UNICEF is working with the federal and state ministries of health and nongovernmental organizations to increase the quality and quantity of water supply. Measures to improve sanitation include health promotion activities, safe handling of food, safe disposal of excreta and distribution of soap, which is supported by the United Nations Logistics Centre. Additional field investigations are planned in order to focus current outbreak control measures, to better understand the epidemiology of HEV transmission in IDP and refugee camps and to elaborate specific recommendations for prevention and control of future HEV epidemics in such settings. ### For more information ',)",625

"(' 20 August 2004 A researcher from China’s Harbin Veterinary Research Institute has today presented initial evidence that pigs from farms in parts of China have been infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. The findings, set out in a table and without further supporting data, were presented today at an international symposium on SARS and avian influenza held in Beijing. WHO has requested confirmation and further details about this study. Pigs are known to be susceptible to infection with avian influenza viruses. However, natural infection of pigs with the H5N1 strain has not been previously reported. In order to assess the implications for human health, it is important to know whether the reported infections in pigs are rare events, possibly caused by contact between pigs and wild birds. Wild aquatic birds, which are the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses, can carry the H5N1 strain without developing symptoms, and are known to excrete large quantities of the virus in their faeces. A comparison of the H5N1 strain isolated in pigs with strains recently circulating in poultry populations in parts of Asia is needed to determine whether the virus is being passed directly from poultry to pigs. Evidence of direct transmission of H5N1 from poultry to large numbers of pigs would be of particular concern, as this would increase opportunities for a new influenza virus with pandemic potential to emerge. Pigs have been implicated in the emergence of new influenza viruses responsible for two of the previous century’s influenza pandemics. Pigs have receptors in their respiratory tract that make them susceptible to infection with human and avian influenza viruses. If a pig is simultaneously infected with both a human and an avian influenza virus, it can serve as a “mixing vessel”, facilitating the exchange of genetic material between the two viruses in a process known as “reassortment”. The resulting new virus, which will not be recognized by the human immune system, will have pandemic potential if it retains sufficient human genes to allow efficient human-to-human transmission, and if it causes severe disease in humans. Confirmation of H5N1 infection in pigs would add complexity to the epidemiology of this disease, but needs to be viewed in perspective. During the peak of the poultry outbreak of H5N1 in Viet Nam earlier this year, extensive testing of pigs on farms where poultry were heavily infected failed to find evidence of infection in pigs. In addition, Hong Kong authorities regularly perform random testing for the H5 avian influenza virus subtype in pigs imported from mainland China. No infection in pigs has been detected to date. WHO, in collaboration with FAO and OIE, will be assessing the implications of reported H5N1 infection in pigs as further details become available. ',)",0
"(' 25 August 2004 Considering the widespread nature of the current H5N1 outbreak in Asia and the capability of influenza viruses to jump the species barriers, it is inevitable that H5N1 virus will be detected in some pigs. Pigs can be infected with both avian and human influenza A viruses-for instance, human influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected in pigs in Asia, Europe and Africa. Some of these human and avian influenza viruses might become adapted to pigs and then begin circulating in pig populations. The co-circulation of avian, human, and pig viruses in pigs is of significant concern because of the potential for a genetic exchange, or ""reassortment,"" of material between these viruses. Such an occurrence has the potential to produce a new, pandemic influenza strain. Last week, a researcher at China\'s Harbin Veterinary Research Institute announced that pigs from farms in parts of China had been infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza (see previous report). China\'s Ministry of Agriculture has since confirmed the researcher\'s findings. What is unclear from the few studies which have been conducted is whether the H5N1 virus has already become established in pig populations in China. Because the findings remain preliminary and are not necessarily indicative for widespread infection among pigs, assessing the consequences of this information for public health is difficult. Providing a detailed risk assessment of the current situation requires an understanding of the main factors influencing the potential for the emergence of a pandemic influenza strain: the prevalence of H5N1 and human H3N2 virus in pigs in Asia, and the likelihood of a reassorted virus and its possible pathogenicity. The role of pigs in genetic reassortment is not fully understood. While there has been no known natural occurrence of reassortment of influenza viruses in pigs that resulted in a new pandemic strain, the probability of this occurrence is not negligible. The chances for genetic reassortment depend upon both the duration of H5N1 circulation in pigs as well as the simultaneous presence of human and pig influenza A viruses (such as H3N2 or H1N1). As long as human and avian influenza viruses are co-circulating - whether in humans or in pigs - the possibility of an exchange of genetic material-exists. To better understand the implications of the findings in China, WHO is encouraging that additional studies be conducted on H5N1 and other influenza A viruses in pigs in China, as well as in other countries which have experienced H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks. In addition, laboratory experiments would be required to shed some light on the probability for virus reassortment, the possible pathogenicity of a reassorted virus, and the chance that pigs will act as a pathway for the emergence of a potential pandemic strain. These results will help national and international public health authorities not only to assess the role pigs and humans play in the emergence of a new influenza pandemic virus from H5N1, but to structure the necessary public health interventions.

"(' 1 September 2004 Health authorities in France have notified WHO of a recent case of rabies in a dog with multiple opportunities to transmit the disease to humans and other animals. WHO is issuing this alert to assist French authorities in tracing persons and their animals known or thought to have been in contact with the infected dog during the period when virus transmission is possible. The dog, accompanied by her owner was present at several public gatherings during a time when numerous tourists were visiting this part of France. On 26 August 2004, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France has confirmed that the dog was rabid. The dog, a four-month-old female, was acquired near Agadir, Morocco, in early July 2004 and illegally imported into France on 11 July 2004. The dog, which was neither registered nor vaccinated against rabies, showed initial clinical signs of illness on 18 August and died on 21 August. The dog is described as of medium size, with medium-length hair of a brown- apricot colour, black muzzle, long tail, and drooping ears. Transmission of rabies from this animal to humans and other animals could have occurred at any time from 2 August to 21 August. Several opportunities for exposure occurred. The dog’s owner, a resident of Bordeaux in the Gironde region, frequently took the dog for walks throughout the city, but most often in the neighbourhoods of Pont de Pierre, Bastide, quai de Queyries, the botanical gardens, and near the lake of Bordeaux. The owner also travelled with the dog to other parts of southwestern France as follows: – on 2 August to Hostens (Gironde region) – on 5 August to the Mimos Festival in Périgueux (Dordogne region) – from 7 to 8 August to a street theatre festival in Miramont de Guyenne (Lot and Garonne region) – from 12 to 14 August to the Fest’Art music festival in Libourne (Gironde region). Throughout the period from 2 to 21 August, the infected dog had several contacts with persons and dogs and is known to have bitten some persons. Several of these people have been identified and treated against rabies. French authorities are now urgently seeking any additional persons and animals who may have been in contact with this dog during the infectious period. In particular, the authorities are seeking: – a French-North African couple with two children (a boy and girl around the age of five) who played with the dog one night (date not known) after 21:00 in Bordeaux on the quai rive gauche; – a young lady speaking French with a Spanish accent who was walking near the lake of Bordeaux with her young daughter and a small white West Highland terrier dog on 10 or 11 August; – a cyclist, around 40 years old, who was chased by the dog on the docks of Garonne in front of the restaurant l’Estacade; – a couple, around 50 years old, who played with the dog near Lac Bleu in Léognan (Gironde). Persons fitting this description are asked urgently to telephone this emergency number in Gironde: (+33) 5 56 90 60 00. Persons who believe their dog may have been in contact with the infected animal, involving licking, sniffing, playing, scratching, or bites, should contact a local veterinary service for an assessment of the risk. Rabies, a viral disease, is invariably fatal in infected humans and animals. Vaccine administered shortly after exposure and immunoglobulin when required can prevent development of the disease. Rabies can be transmitted throughout the period of infectivity via saliva, bites, scratches, or licking. ### For more information ',)",1

"(' 7 September 2004 WHO has received informal reports of a laboratory-confirmed fatal case of influenza A H5 infection in Viet Nam. The patient is thought to be a child who was hospitalized in Hanoi and who died over the weekend. Further details are awaited from official sources. Detection of an H5 subtype of influenza A in a human should always arouse a very high level of suspicion that the case was caused by the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, particularly in a country with ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype that has ever been shown to cause disease in humans. Since August, Viet Nam has detected four human cases of H5 infection. These cases have occurred amidst recurring H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in several Asian countries. Since January of this year, altogether 39 human cases have been reported from two countries, Viet Nam and Thailand. Of these cases, 28 have been fatal. ### For more information ### ',)",4
"(' 28 September 2004 Two new cases confirmed Since yesterday, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed two new cases of H5N1 avian influenza in humans. The cases are a 26-year-old woman, who died on 20 September, and her 32-year-old sister, who remains hospitalized in stable condition. These new cases bring the total in Thailand confirmed since early September to three. Altogether, Thailand has reported 15 cases, of which 10 were fatal, since the first human cases were detected in January of this year. Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission in a family cluster The most recent cases are part of a family cluster of four cases under investigation to determine whether human-to-human transmission may have occurred. Immediate investigation of any possible human-to-human transmission is always needed to determine whether transmission has been efficient and sustained. Such a situation would be cause for alarm, as it might signal the start of an influenza pandemic. Inefficient, limited human-to-human transmission may occur on rare occasions and is in line with what is known, from epidemiological and laboratory investigations, about the possible behaviour of the H5N1 virus. The initial case in the family cluster was an 11-year-old girl who died of pneumonia on 8 September. Thai authorities regard her as a probable case of H5N1; laboratory confirmation is not possible as no specimens from this patient are available for testing. The girl, who lived in the northern province of Kamphaeng Phet, resided with her 32-year-old aunt, whose infection has been confirmed. Both patients are known to have had contact with dead chickens. The girl’s 26-year-old mother, whose infection is also now confirmed, resided in the Bangkok area, but provided bedside care for her daughter while hospitalized, up to the time of the child’s death. The mother fell ill upon her return to Bangkok, where she died on 20 September. Thai officials have concluded that the mother could have acquired the infection either from some environmental source or while caring for her daughter, and that this represents a probable case of human-to-human transmission. The family cluster also includes the 6-year-old son of the aunt of the initial case. He was hospitalized but is recovering, and samples are being tested. Surveillance for additional cases, among health workers and in the wider community, has been greatly intensified in the province, and hospitals nationwide have been placed on heightened alert for further cases. While the investigation of this family cluster provides evidence that human- to-human transmission may have occurred, evidence to date indicates that transmission of the virus among humans has been limited to family members and that no wider transmission in the community has occurred. Continued vigilance is needed to determine whether the epidemiological situation in humans remains stable. Clinical samples taken from cases in the family cluster were immediately shared with a laboratory in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Virus isolated from these samples will undergo genetic and antigenic analysis to determine whether the virus has evolved and, more specifically, whether it has acquired genes that allow improved transmissibility among humans.

The level of pandemic risk depends on how widespread H5N1 is in domestic poultry, how often the virus is transmitted to humans, and the concurrent circulation of human influenza viruses. Areas with the highest prevalence of avian influenza were not directly affected by the tsunami, thus there is no inherent increased risk of the emergence of the pandemic strain due to the tsunami itself. However, any activity that spreads avian influenza increases the possibility of the emergence of a pandemic virus. The risk of importing avian influenza into areas affected by the tsunami can be minimized by controlling the movement of poultry from areas where outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred. It is also important to ensure that infected poultry are kept out of the food chain, including emergency food relief activities. ',)",31

The cases concern a 5-year-old boy from the central province of Quang Binh, a 17-year-old girl from the northern province of Nam Dinh, and a 40-year-old woman from the northern province of Quang Ninh. The 17-year-old girl has died. An earlier case has also been confirmed. These recently confirmed cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December to 28. WHO is aware of reports of suspected H5 avian influenza infection in five members of a family who are presently hospitalized in the northern port city of Haiphong. These cases, which include the parents and their three young daughters, are undergoing further investigation following initial tests indicating infection with the H5 subtype of avian influenza. Reports indicate outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in the vicinity. Field investigation of this family cluster is under way. The current outbreak of human cases in Viet Nam has included several clusters, mostly in family members, of cases closely related in time and place. Thorough investigation of all such clusters is essential to determine possible changes in the behaviour of the virus and thus support assessment of the risk of an influenza pandemic. There is currently no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person. Rapid sharing with WHO of viruses from recent clusters of cases has become increasingly important. Analysis can determine whether any significant changes in the virus have taken place and provide further support for risk assessment. Several media reports have recently covered rumours of a large outbreak of influenza-like illness in Quang Binh Province. The outbreak is presently under investigation by provincial and central health authorities. Samples have been taken for testing, and WHO is awaiting the results. The number of cases with influenza-like illness appears much smaller than initially reported by the media. Cambodia The Ministry of Health in Cambodia has today confirmed the country’s second human case of avian influenza. The 28-year-old man, from Kampot Province, developed symptoms on 17 March and was hospitalized in Phnom Penh on 21 March. He died on 22 March. The same day, laboratory tests by the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh confirmed that the man was infected with H5 avian influenza virus. The Cambodian government immediately launched an investigation to search for possible additional cases and identify possible sources of exposure to the virus. The investigation team, which is continuing its work in Kampot Province, includes Cambodian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agricultural officials joined by staff from the WHO country office and the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh. FAO is assisting the investigation of animal disease. Numerous deaths among chickens in the area have been reported and samples taken from sick chickens have tested positive for avian influenza. The results from the investigation indicate the deceased man had contact with sick poultry. An 18 year-old boy initially identified as an additional suspected case has tested negative for the avian influenza virus. Samples taken from twenty seven other people, including family contacts of the confirmed case and Phnom Penh medical staff involved in his care, have all tested negative for H5 avian influenza infection. Results from a further six people from Kampot Province have also tested negative for H5 influenza virus. Cambodia’s previous case, a 25-year-old woman who died in late January, was also from Kampot Province but lived in another district. The majority of poultry in Cambodia are raised in small backyard flocks in rural areas, making surveillance for outbreaks especially challenging. A campaign to educate rural populations about the dangers of contact with dead or diseased poultry is being undertaken by the government, with support from WHO. ',)",2

Uige remains the epicentre of the outbreak. While children under the age of 5 years initially accounted for around 75% of cases, recent cases are including an increasing number of adults. One person is currently under investigation for Marburg haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Assessment of the outbreak WHO is concerned about the further evolution of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola, and this concern is fully shared by the government. Following confirmation of Marburg virus as the causative agent, on 21 March, WHO sent its senior epidemiologists to Uige to assess the situation and organize an initial emergency response. That assessment prompted a rapid and massive augmentation of support in the form of international teams of specialized staff, presently in Uige and Luanda, and several shipments of supplies. Staff have been drawn from WHO and its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Equipment to strengthen local diagnostic and communication capacity is also now in place. This escalation of support is continuing, with the government making great efforts to facilitate the rapid influx of staff and supplies and set up the basic infrastructure for a sustained emergency response. WHO has acquired extensive experience in the successful control of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, a closely-related disease that is clinically almost identical. Based on this experience, WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be brought under control. At the same time, however, the implementation of effective control measures faces several significant challenges, some of which may be unique to this outbreak. Marburg haemorrhagic fever is an extremely rare disease that remains poorly understood. Information on the behaviour of Marburg virus once it enters a human population is sparse. As detailed in a fact sheet recently issued by WHO, the outbreak in Angola is one of only two large outbreaks of this disease that have occurred in indigenous African populations since the virus was first detected in 1967. The only other large outbreak, which began in late 1998 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was confined to two sparsely populated villages in an isolated corner of the country, caused sporadic cases with small chains of transmission over two years, and never reached the intensity of transmission seen in just the past few weeks in Angola. The outbreak in Angola is not only the largest on record, with the highest fatality, but is also the first to occur in an urban setting. Almost three decades of civil unrest have left Angola with a severely weakened health infrastructure, a hospital system in dire need of basic equipment and supplies, inadequate communication and transportation systems, and a population weakened by economic hardship. These weaknesses hamper containment efforts, which depend on active surveillance for cases, rapid detection and isolation in specially designated and equipped facilities, and rapid tracing of contacts. Based on experiences with Ebola, control measures can have an immediate impact by interrupting chains of transmission. The eventual success of such measures depends on their sustained application, supported by efficient surveillance, and requires very good communication and transportation systems. Such systems are not presently available in Angola and cannot be established quickly. As another consequence of the country’s recent history, hundreds of thousands of landmines are thought to remain in the country, making transportation by rail and road precarious and necessitating air transport of staff and equipment. Intensified surveillance in Uige over the past few days has determined that some patients are not being hospitalized and are dying within the community, creating an urgent need to organize services for the safe collection and burial of deceased persons. Cases in health care workers point to the need to greatly increase supplies of protective equipment for front-line workers, particularly in hard-hit Uige and densely populated Luanda. WHO has arranged three shipments of this equipment to date; more shipments are on their way. Personal protective equipment is also being supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Médecins sans Frontières, and UNICEF. Nonetheless, supplies still fall short of the need. The symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and its rapid fatality in the majority of cases, can cause great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety increases the risk that people in affected areas may flee to other areas, thus fanning wider spread. Moreover, control measures are socially disruptive and may further increase public unease. In Uige, there is some evidence of a reluctance to seek treatment or remain under care in hospitals. Efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the hospital system, restore public confidence, and thus improve compliance with control measures. Numerous alerts are now being received each day, and teams from the Ministry of Health and WHO are being rapidly deployed to conduct investigations. Outcomes are reported daily by radio, and information about the evolution of the outbreak is improving. The incubation period of this disease, which can be as short as 3 days, necessitates rapid and efficient contact tracing, and this has been made a priority. Good tracing and management of contacts helps to ensure that possible cases are isolated prior to the onset of symptoms, when the risk of transmission to others is highest. Other current priorities include the protection of front-line staff, strengthening of infection control in designated isolation wards, improved transportation of suspected cases to these wards, and public education to encourage protective behaviours and improve compliance with control measures. In addition to these fundamental tasks, a top priority at present is to prevent the virus from establishing a foothold in densely populated urban or peri-urban parts of the country. For example, Uige, which is presently the epicentre of the outbreak, has around 500,000 inhabitants, but Luanda, where some cases have been reported, has a population close to 3 million. Response capacity in Luanda is being strengthened by the Ministry of Health, and WHO is increasing the number of international staff there as a support. International collaboration Over the past two weeks, WHO has provided support to the Ministry of Health from Headquarters, the Regional Office for Africa, and Country Offices in Angola and in Mozambique.

"(' 7 April 2005 As of 6 April, 200 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 173 have died. Kuanza Sul has reported its first case, bringing the number of affected provinces to six, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country. International diagnostic and laboratory support For laboratory work, Marburg virus has been classified as an extremely hazardous pathogen and can be handled safely only in specialized high- containment laboratories. WHO has established an international network of expert laboratories for the diagnosis of Marburg and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Within this network, laboratories in Canada, Germany, South Africa, and the USA are providing diagnostic support for the Angolan outbreak. All have experience in working with Marburg virus. Scientists from these laboratories are sharing test results and information on laboratory techniques in a virtual network and during weekly teleconferences. To ensure accurate tracking of the outbreak, members of the network are also standardizing methods for sample collection, testing, and the interpretation of results. The various diagnostic tests for Marburg haemorrhagic fever require skilled technical interpretation, as findings can vary according to the phase of the patient’s illness, the way in which samples were taken, and the type of test used. In Angola, a portable field laboratory is now operating in Uige and a second one should be operational in Luanda shortly. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly. The laboratory network is providing backup support for situations in which exceptionally precise diagnostic results are important because of the implications for control measures. Such situations include the possible exportation of a case to another country, and a suspected case in a person who may have placed numerous other people at unusually high risk. Sophisticated laboratory studies of the virus may help shed some light on certain unusual features of the outbreak, including the high fatality rate and the overwhelming concentration of initial cases in children under the age of five years. In this regard, comparisons of the virus with strains from previous outbreaks may be instructive. A longer-term objective, whose achievement has long proved elusive, is to determine where Marburg virus hides in nature between outbreaks. Studies of viruses from Angola may offer some clues. Prior to the present outbreak, Angola was not considered to fall within the geographical “hot zone”, thought to be in central and eastern Africa, for outbreaks and sporadic cases of this rare disease. Laboratories in the Marburg virtual network include: * Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory,Winnipeg, Canada and field laboratory in Uige, Angola * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Special Pathogen Branch, Atlanta, USA and field laboratory in Luanda, Angola * Bernhard-Nocht-Institut für Tropenmedizin, Hamburg, Germany * Institut für Virologie, Marburg, Germany * National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory, Special Pathogens Unit, Sandringham, South Africa.

"(' 13 April 2005 As of 11 April, 231 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 210 have died. Uige Province, with 202 cases and 190 deaths, remains the most severely affected area. The present outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever is unprecedented in its size and urban nature, and its dimensions are still unfolding. Although surveillance to detect cases has improved, it remains patchy. In Uige, where daily mobile teams are active, surveillance continues to be largely concentrated on the investigation of deaths and collection of bodies. The security of teams remains a concern. More vehicles are needed and WHO is making the necessary arrangements on an urgent basis. To bring the outbreak under control, the detection and isolation of patients needs to be much earlier, but this will not happen until the public understands the disease and the high risks associated with treating patients in homes. Infection control needs to improve in heath care settings, and WHO is continuing to supply effective personal protective equipment, for both national and international staff, adapted to conditions in African countries. A welcome development is the decision by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to strengthen its presence in Uige. Volunteers from these societies are part of a group of workers mobilized to conduct a door-to-door public information and education campaign in collaboration with community and church leaders and traditional healers. Today, workers received specialized training from experts in social mobilization and medical anthropology drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. These workers have been rapidly deployed to deliver public talks at markets and schools. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has extensive experience in responding to emergencies in Africa and has been instrumental in bringing large outbreaks of Ebola under control. Because of this experience, workers from the Federation are usually viewed by communities as welcome help. WHO anticipates that this added and welcome support to response activities will help create greater acceptance of control measures and reduce high-risk behaviours. Advice for travellers All currently available data indicate that casual contact plays no role in the spread of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Transmission requires extremely close contact involving exposure to blood or other bodily fluids from a patient who will most likely be showing visible signs of illness. The disease can also be transmitted following exposure to items, including bedding and clothing, recently contaminated by a patient. In addition, transmission can occur in hospitals lacking adequate equipment and supplies for infection control and training in their proper use. The hospital system in Angola has suffered from almost three decades of civil unrest, and several cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have occurred in health care staff exposed during the treatment of patients in Uige. To date, WHO is not aware of any cases of Marburg that have occurred in foreign nationals other than those involved in the care of cases in Uige. WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel to any destination within Angola, but does advise some precautions. Travellers to Angola should be aware of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and of the need to avoid close contact with ill persons. Persons with existing medical conditions who might require hospitalization should consider deferring non-essential travel to Angola, particularly to Uige Province. Those travelling to Angola for the purpose of working in health care settings should be fully informed regarding the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, equipped with effective personal protective equipment, and trained in the procedures to prevent transmission in such settings. Travellers leaving Angola should be advised to seek medical attention should any illness with fever develop within 10 days of their departure. Information about recent travel to Angola should be included when symptoms are reported. Health care workers and health authorities in countries neighbouring Angola should be aware of the symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and maintain vigilance for cases. Countries having close ties with Angola, necessitating frequent travel there by their citizens, may want to consider the introduction of measures to increase vigilance for potential symptoms in persons returning from Angola. In some cases, the introduction of screening procedures to identify potentially infected persons may be considered. WHO recommends that travellers with a clear exposure history be treated as contacts and placed under surveillance for 21 days, during which time their temperature should be monitored daily. ',)",231

The isolation ward at the province’s large 400-bed hospital, which has been specially equipped and staffed for the care of Marburg patients, is empty, despite the fact that cases and deaths are known to be occurring in the community. It is apparent that, for the time being, the community does not accept the concept of isolation. Residents are unwilling to report suspected cases and allow these people to be managed under conditions that reduce the risk of further transmission. Measures such as patient isolation and infection control that reduce opportunities for further transmission are the principal tools for bringing the outbreak under control. Given the urgency of the situation, WHO may temporarily introduce, as an emergency measure, a harm reduction strategy aimed at making a dangerous situation somewhat better. Family members and other caregivers who refuse to allow patients to be cared for in the isolation facility are being informed of ways to protect themselves from infection and given appropriate supplies. WHO has placed urgent orders for disinfectants, which are currently in short supply in Angola. Today, international staff drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network began training sessions for staff at the provincial hospital in the use of equipment and supplies to reduce the risk of infection in the health care setting. This training, which has been very well received, will continue through Saturday. Fever-screening units are being established to ensure that all persons admitted to hospital are initially screened for symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever before being admitted to the general hospital wards. Apart from continuing security concerns, another pressing problem is poor access to remote communities in Uige Province and correspondingly poor surveillance for cases in these areas. With the assistance of a military helicopter, international staff have begun pre-positioning supplies and equipment needed for outbreak control in these areas so that a response can be launched immediately should cases begin to occur. In a tragic development, four Red Cross volunteers, freshly trained in social mobilization, were killed today by lightning while on their way to work. Support from Red Cross volunteers has been instrumental in controlling large outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. WHO recognizes the importance of this support and deeply regrets the death of these volunteers. ',)",235
"(' 15 April 2005 Data on cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola are being reclassified and no nation-wide data can be reported today. Detailed data are available for Uige, the most severely affected province, where surveillance has been steadily improving. As of 14 April, 224 cases have been reported. Of these cases, 207 were fatal. Most cases have occurred in Uige municipality, which has reported 175 cases and 163 deaths. Much smaller numbers of cases have been reported from a further 7 municipalities in this province. Improvement of public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control measures has become one of the most urgent priorities. Today, meetings were held in the WHO office in Uige with traditional community leaders, known as Sobas, for all of Uige municipality. The governor of the province and the director of its health services have released the Sobas from their present duties for seven days so that they can accompany mobile surveillance and medical teams as they search for cases and collect bodies. This decision is welcomed as an important step forward in achieving community acceptance of measures needed to bring the outbreak under control. WHO staff in Uige now plan to systematically extend the same procedures, using locally respected Sobas, to all other municipalities known to be affected by the disease. This plan is supported by the authorities. Training to protect staff at the provincial hospital from infection and reduce the risk of transmission is continuing. Today, training was provided for 82 nurses in high-risk departments, including the maternity ward and the laboratory. Heads of departments and doctors were trained yesterday. Training for health staff in private clinics and for health workers in the police force is planned for early next week. In response to an international appeal launched on 8 April, WHO has received pledges of funding, to support the outbreak response, from Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO).

In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 250 cases, of which 228 were fatal, were reported as of 20 April. A team of 28 Angolese health care professionals, assembled by the government, arrived today in Uige to provide further support to control activities. They have been assigned to work on infection control, surveillance for new cases, and the tracing and management of contacts, and are being trained and equipped for these tasks. The new staff will also join teams visiting communities within the affected municipalities in order to improve public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control measures. These teams are already supported by traditional community leaders, known as Sobas, and local volunteers. Public understanding of the disease and participation in the outbreak response remain the most important factors influencing successful control. Activities needed to prevent further transmission within the hospital setting are well under way. In addition, protective gloves, soap, and instructions about the importance of their use have been provided to traditional healers and midwives. Significant progress has been made in increasing the engagement of affected communities. Some cases and deaths have, however, continued to occur within the community. Efforts to rapidly isolate cases, shortly after symptom onset, and follow up contacts need to be further intensified. Teams investigating recent deaths within the community have determined that some families providing care in their homes are administering injections to patients. This practice carries a high risk and can perpetuate transmission within the community. Educational messages and materials communicating the associated dangers were developed today and will be added to the information already being provided to communities. ',)",266
"(' 22 April 2005 As of 20 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 266 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 244 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 253 cases, of which 233 have been fatal, were reported as of 21 April. Assessment of the outbreak The international response to the outbreak in Angola began one month ago, on 22 March. The features of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and the conditions in Angola, have been an extreme test of international capacity to hold emerging diseases at bay. The outbreak in Angola is the largest and deadliest on record for this rare disease, which is presently showing a case fatality rate higher than 90%. For comparison, outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever have shown mortality rates ranging, according to the virus strain involved, from 53% to 88%. The only other large outbreak of Marburg, in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 through 2000, had a case fatality of 83%. Two factors make the rapid detection of outbreaks of Marburg haemorrhagic fever difficult: the extreme rarity of this disease and its similarity to other diseases seen in countries where deaths from infectious diseases are common. Neither the source nor the date of the initial cases in Angola can be presently identified with any certainty. The number of cases began increasing in February and then, more dramatically, in March. On 21 March, Marburg virus was detected in patient samples sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (USA), and WHO assistance was requested by the Ministry of Health in Angola. The operational response began the following day. As known from extensive experience with outbreaks of other viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, outbreaks of Marburg can be brought to an end using classic public health interventions. In theory, the measures needed to end the Angolan outbreak are few in number and straightforward in nature. Rapid detection and isolation of patients, tracing and management of their close contacts, infection control in hospitals and protective clothing for staff work to interrupt chains of transmission and thus seal off opportunities for further spread. Such straightforward measures are complicated by the distinct features of this disease. The sudden onset, dramatic symptoms, and rapid deterioration of patients, and the absence of a vaccine and effective treatment, invariably incite great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety, in turn, can interfere with control operations, especially when communities begin hiding cases and bodies because of suspicions about the safety of hospitals. In the current outbreak, such suspicions are understandable. Very few patients with laboratory-confirmed Marburg haemorrhagic fever have survived; most hospitalized patients have died within a day or two following admission. For affected communities, staff from the mobile teams, fully suited in protective gear, are seen as taking away relatives and loved ones who may never again be seen alive. WHO staff in Uige have today reported further signs that community attitudes are improving, though hostility towards the mobile teams remains of concern in one area known to have recent cases and deaths. Efforts to sensitize affected communities are continuing, with local volunteers supported by Portuguese- speaking experts from Brazil and Mozambique. Conditions in Angola – a country weakened by almost three decades of civil unrest – have presented additional challenges. Supplies of water and electricity are intermittent, also in health care facilities. Weakened infrastructures, including those for communications and transportation, are another problem. Yesterday, the WHO office in Uige was informed of a death in another municipality, but was unable to collect the body for safe burial because of poor road conditions. Fortunately, spread of the disease beyond Uige Province, located in the interior of the country, has been limited. Of the 266 cases and 244 deaths, 197 cases and 183 deaths occurred in Uige municipality. Other municipalities in Uige Province account for an additional 56 cases and 50 deaths. WHO believes that the risk of international spread is low. No foreign nationals, with the exception of those involved in the direct care of patients, have been infected. There is no evidence that people can spread the virus before the onset of symptoms. Shortly after symptom onset, patients become rapidly and visibly very ill WHO is optimistic that the outbreak can be controlled if present activities continue with sufficient vigour. All the essential containment measures are being applied with extensive international support, including more than 60 international staff drawn from institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and the cooperation of national authorities and experts. Tools and methods developed during international responses to outbreaks of other diseases have all been brought to bear on the present outbreak, and the success of this collaborative effort has surpassed initial expectations. Needs, which have ranged from satellite telephones and hand-held radio sets to vehicles, protective equipment, disinfectants, and specialized staff, have been rapidly communicated and immediately met. WHO and its partners are nonetheless prepared and organized to continue the outbreak response for several additional months, if this is needed. An important present goal is to transfer skills and responsibilities for outbreak response to national staff, and training efforts are under way with this goal in mind. ',)",266
"(' 29 April 2005 As of 27 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 275 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 255 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 266 cases, of which 246 have been fatal, were reported as of 28 April. With all control measures – teams, equipment, and protocols – needed to contain the outbreak now in place, extreme care must be taken to guard against any practices that could again amplify transmission. At this point in the outbreak, an amplification event would be a setback capable of extending the presently intense containment efforts for several weeks. During past outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, such events have historically resulted in an additional two transmission cycles and a second wave of cases. Control operations in Uige have experienced some recent setbacks. On two occasions earlier this week, doctors at Uige’s large provincial hospital were directly exposed to blood from Marburg patients being treated on general wards, without adequate infection control. The doctors are under observation. These high-risk exposures should not have occurred. Such incidents indicate that infection control procedures at the hospital have been seriously compromised. They occurred despite a system put in place, and supported by equipment and training, to safely screen new admissions for exposure history and fever and ensure the separation of possible cases from patients on the general wards. In another recent incident, the body of a deceased patient was left, uncleaned and uncollected, on an open ward for more than eight hours, placing hospital staff and other patients at risk. In another incident, a severely ill baby admitted to the paediatric ward was placed in a cot, without disinfection, immediately after the body of another baby, who died from the disease, had been removed. In line with cultural practices, mothers are present on the paediatric ward and share the care of severely ill children, thus also sharing the exposure risk. Under such conditions, amplification of transmission is highly likely to occur. Had safety protocols, set in place by the international team, been followed, none of these incidents would have occurred. Closing of the hospital has been considered but is not a viable option. Such a step would deprive many patients of potentially life-saving care while re-directing others to private clinics, where conditions and practices are even more unsafe and even more likely to result in additional cases. Yesterday, the Minister of Health, accompanied by a vice-minister and the head of the WHO office in Angola, flew to Uige to investigate the situation, find solutions, and oversee their implementation. The officials have recognized that strong measures will be needed to ensure that patients admitted to the hospital for other conditions are not placed at risk of Marburg infection. The first steps to correct the situation were put in place today, and involve the collaboration of ministry officials, WHO, and Médecins Sans Frontières. WHO has decided to strengthen the presence in Uige of international staff specialized in infection control. WHO welcomes the direct intervention of ministry officials. This high-level support should help ensure that containment measures, previously set in place and of proven efficacy, are restored and fully adhered to. Investigation of several recent fatalities in Uige indicates a clear link between home-based treatments using unsafe syringes and spread of the virus. This problem is being addressed urgently. A massive door-to-door campaign, supported by banners and posters throughout Uige municipality, was launched yesterday to inform residents of the associated dangers and collect and safely destroy syringes. The campaign has continued today. ',)",275

"(' ## Situation assessment and implications for human health 18 August 2005 Beginning in late July 2005, official reports to the OIE from government authorities indicate that the H5N1 virus has expanded its geographical range. Both Russia and Kazakhstan reported outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in late July, and confirmed H5N1 as the causative agent in early August. Deaths in migratory birds, infected with the virus, have also been reported. Outbreaks in both countries have been attributed to contact between domestic birds and wild waterfowl via shared water sources. These are the first outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza recorded in the two countries. Both countries were previously considered free of the virus. Since the initial reports, the Russian H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which has remained confined to Siberia, has spread progressively westward to affect 6 administrative regions. In Kazakhstan, several villages bordering the initial outbreak site in Siberia are now known to have experienced disease in poultry. To date, outbreaks in the two countries have involved some large farms as well as small backyard flocks, with close to 120,000 birds dead or destroyed in Russia and more than 9,000 affected in Kazakhstan. In early August, Mongolia issued an emergency report following the death of 89 migratory birds at two lakes in the northern part of the country. Avian influenza virus type A has been identified as the cause, but the virus strain has not yet been determined. Samples have been shared with WHO reference laboratories and are currently being investigated. Also in early August, an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry was detected in Tibet, China. In all of these recent outbreaks, authorities have announced control measures in line with FAO and OIE recommendations for highly pathogenic avian influenza. To date, no human cases have been detected, vigilance is high, and rumours are being investigated by local authorities. The outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan provide evidence that H5N1 viruses have spread beyond their initial focus in south-east Asian countries, where outbreaks are now known to have begun in mid-2003. Despite aggressive control efforts, FAO has warned that the H5N1 virus continues to be detected in many parts of Viet Nam and Indonesia and in some parts of Cambodia, China, Thailand, and possibly also Laos. The south-east Asian outbreaks, which have resulted in the death or destruction of more than 150 million birds, have had severe consequences for agriculture and most especially for the many rural farmers who depend on small backyard flocks for income and food. Human cases, most of which have been linked to direct contact with diseased or dead poultry in rural areas, have been confirmed in four countries: Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Only a few instances of limited human-to-human transmission have been recorded. Poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea were successfully controlled. WHO fully agrees with FAO and OIE that control of avian influenza infection in wild bird populations is not feasible and should not be attempted. Wild waterfowl have been known for some time to be the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. Migratory birds can carry these viruses, in their low pathogenic form, over long distances, but do not usually develop signs of illness and only rarely die of the disease. The instances in which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in migratory birds are likewise rare, and the role of these birds in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza remains poorly understood. Very large die-offs of migratory birds from avian influenza, such as the one detected at the end of April at Qinghai Lake in central China, in which more than 6,000 birds died, are considered unusual. Research published in July indicates that H5N1 viruses in that outbreak are similar to viruses that have been circulating in south-east Asia for the last two years. Analyses of viruses from the Russian outbreak, recently published on the OIE website, show apparent similarity to viruses isolated from migratory birds during the Qinghai Lake outbreak. Specimens from the Mongolian outbreak in migratory birds should also prove useful in shedding light on these recent developments. Monitoring the spread and evolution of avian H5N1 viruses in birds and rapidly comparing these results with previously characterized H5N1 viruses is an essential activity for assessing the risk of pandemic influenza. Implications for human health The poultry outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan are caused by a virus that has repeatedly demonstrated its ability, in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, in Hong Kong in 2003, and in south-east Asia since early 2004, to cross the species barrier to infect humans, causing severe disease with high fatality. A similar risk of human cases exists in areas newly affected with H5N1 disease in poultry. Experience in south-east Asia indicates that human cases of infection are rare, and that the virus does not transmit easily from poultry to humans. To date, the majority of human cases have occurred in rural areas. Most, but not all, human cases have been linked to direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry, notably during slaughtering, defeathering, and food preparation. No cases have been confirmed in poultry workers or cullers. No cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs. Factors relating to poultry densities and farming systems seen in different countries may also influence the risk that human cases will occur. During a 2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the H7N7 strain, in the Netherlands, more than 80 cases of conjunctivitis were detected in poultry workers, cullers, and their close contacts, and one veterinarian died. That event, which was contained following the destruction of around 30 million poultry, underscores the need for newly affected countries to follow FAO/OIE/WHO recommended precautions when undertaking control measures in affected farms. Pandemic risk assessment The possible spread of H5N1 avian influenza to poultry in additional countries cannot be ruled out. WHO recommends heightened surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and die-offs in migratory birds, and rapid introduction of containment measures, as recommended by FAO and OIE. Heightened vigilance for cases of respiratory disease in persons with a history of exposure to infected poultry is also recommended in countries with known poultry outbreaks. The provision of clinical specimens and viruses, from humans and animals, to WHO and OIE/FAO reference laboratories allows studies that contribute to the assessment of pandemic risk and helps ensure that work towards vaccine development stays on course. The expanding geographical presence of the virus is of concern as it creates further opportunities for human exposure. Each additional human case increases opportunities for the virus to improve its transmissibility, through either adaptive mutation or reassortment. The emergence of an H5N1 strain that is readily transmitted among humans would mark the start of a pandemic. ',)",0

The south-east Asian outbreaks, which have resulted in the death or destruction of more than 150 million birds, have had severe consequences for agriculture and most especially for the many rural farmers who depend on small backyard flocks for income and food. Human cases, most of which have been linked to direct contact with diseased or dead poultry in rural areas, have been confirmed in four countries: Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Only a few instances of limited human-to-human transmission have been recorded. Poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea were successfully controlled. WHO fully agrees with FAO and OIE that control of avian influenza infection in wild bird populations is not feasible and should not be attempted. Wild waterfowl have been known for some time to be the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. Migratory birds can carry these viruses, in their low pathogenic form, over long distances, but do not usually develop signs of illness and only rarely die of the disease. The instances in which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in migratory birds are likewise rare, and the role of these birds in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza remains poorly understood. Very large die-offs of migratory birds from avian influenza, such as the one detected at the end of April at Qinghai Lake in central China, in which more than 6,000 birds died, are considered unusual. Research published in July indicates that H5N1 viruses in that outbreak are similar to viruses that have been circulating in south-east Asia for the last two years. Analyses of viruses from the Russian outbreak, recently published on the OIE website, show apparent similarity to viruses isolated from migratory birds during the Qinghai Lake outbreak. Specimens from the Mongolian outbreak in migratory birds should also prove useful in shedding light on these recent developments. Monitoring the spread and evolution of avian H5N1 viruses in birds and rapidly comparing these results with previously characterized H5N1 viruses is an essential activity for assessing the risk of pandemic influenza. Implications for human health The poultry outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan are caused by a virus that has repeatedly demonstrated its ability, in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, in Hong Kong in 2003, and in south-east Asia since early 2004, to cross the species barrier to infect humans, causing severe disease with high fatality. A similar risk of human cases exists in areas newly affected with H5N1 disease in poultry. Experience in south-east Asia indicates that human cases of infection are rare, and that the virus does not transmit easily from poultry to humans. To date, the majority of human cases have occurred in rural areas. Most, but not all, human cases have been linked to direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry, notably during slaughtering, defeathering, and food preparation. No cases have been confirmed in poultry workers or cullers. No cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs. Factors relating to poultry densities and farming systems seen in different countries may also influence the risk that human cases will occur. During a 2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the H7N7 strain, in the Netherlands, more than 80 cases of conjunctivitis were detected in poultry workers, cullers, and their close contacts, and one veterinarian died. That event, which was contained following the destruction of around 30 million poultry, underscores the need for newly affected countries to follow FAO/OIE/WHO recommended precautions when undertaking control measures in affected farms. Pandemic risk assessment The possible spread of H5N1 avian influenza to poultry in additional countries cannot be ruled out. WHO recommends heightened surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and die-offs in migratory birds, and rapid introduction of containment measures, as recommended by FAO and OIE. Heightened vigilance for cases of respiratory disease in persons with a history of exposure to infected poultry is also recommended in countries with known poultry outbreaks. The provision of clinical specimens and viruses, from humans and animals, to WHO and OIE/FAO reference laboratories allows studies that contribute to the assessment of pandemic risk and helps ensure that work towards vaccine development stays on course. The expanding geographical presence of the virus is of concern as it creates further opportunities for human exposure. Each additional human case increases opportunities for the virus to improve its transmissibility, through either adaptive mutation or reassortment. The emergence of an H5N1 strain that is readily transmitted among humans would mark the start of a pandemic. ',)",0
"(' ## Situation assessment and implications for human health 18 August 2005 Beginning in late July 2005, official reports to the OIE from government authorities indicate that the H5N1 virus has expanded its geographical range. Both Russia and Kazakhstan reported outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in late July, and confirmed H5N1 as the causative agent in early August. Deaths in migratory birds, infected with the virus, have also been reported. Outbreaks in both countries have been attributed to contact between domestic birds and wild waterfowl via shared water sources. These are the first outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza recorded in the two countries. Both countries were previously considered free of the virus. Since the initial reports, the Russian H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which has remained confined to Siberia, has spread progressively westward to affect 6 administrative regions. In Kazakhstan, several villages bordering the initial outbreak site in Siberia are now known to have experienced disease in poultry. To date, outbreaks in the two countries have involved some large farms as well as small backyard flocks, with close to 120,000 birds dead or destroyed in Russia and more than 9,000 affected in Kazakhstan. In early August, Mongolia issued an emergency report following the death of 89 migratory birds at two lakes in the northern part of the country. Avian influenza virus type A has been identified as the cause, but the virus strain has not yet been determined. Samples have been shared with WHO reference laboratories and are currently being investigated. Also in early August, an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry was detected in Tibet, China. In all of these recent outbreaks, authorities have announced control measures in line with FAO and OIE recommendations for highly pathogenic avian influenza. To date, no human cases have been detected, vigilance is high, and rumours are being investigated by local authorities. The outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan provide evidence that H5N1 viruses have spread beyond their initial focus in south-east Asian countries, where outbreaks are now known to have begun in mid-2003. Despite aggressive control efforts, FAO has warned that the H5N1 virus continues to be detected in many parts of Viet Nam and Indonesia and in some parts of Cambodia, China, Thailand, and possibly also Laos.

The case occurred in a 37-year-old woman who resided in Jakarta. She developed symptoms on 31 August, was hospitalized on 6 September, and died on 10 September. The positive test results were received from a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong. The government has launched investigations, assisted by WHO, aimed at identifying the source of the woman’s infection and tracing her close contacts, including family members, neighbours, and hospital staff engaged in her treatment. The woman lived in an area with multiple opportunities for exposure to chickens and ducks. No recent poultry deaths have been reported in the area. Poultry samples have been taken by agriculture authorities as part of the ongoing investigation. This is the country’s second laboratory-confirmed case. In July 2005, a cluster of 3 deaths in one family was investigated. H5N1 infection was confirmed in the 38-year-old father but laboratory test results for his two daughters did not meet criteria for acute H5N1 infections. WHO reports only laboratory-confirmed cases. Investigation of the July family cluster was unable to determine the source of exposure. Testing and monitoring of more than 300 close contacts failed to detect any further cases. ',)",4

"(' 13 October 2005 Tests conducted by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have today confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in samples taken from domestic birds in Turkey.

Further testing is under way to determine the strain and whether the virus is highly pathogenic. Authorities in the two countries have undertaken control measures as recommended by OIE and FAO.

Viruses from both outbreaks have been sent for further analysis to the Central Veterinary Laboratory Agency-Weybridge (UK), which is an OIE/FAO reference laboratory. Viruses are also being sent to WHO reference laboratories for comparison with human H5N1 isolates from Asia. Public health implications The spread of H5N1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. However, all evidence to date indicates that the H5N1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans. WHO advises countries experiencing outbreaks in poultry to follow certain precautions, particularly during culling operations, and to monitor persons with a possible exposure history for fever or respiratory symptoms. The early symptoms of H5N1 infection mimic those of many other common respiratory illnesses, meaning that false alarms are likely. The WHO level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another. WHO continues to recommend that travellers to areas experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms. Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings from infected birds. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead migratory birds or wild birds showing signs of disease. Direct contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their droppings, is considered the main route of human infection. Exposure risk is considered highest during slaughter, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for cooking. There is no evidence that properly cooked poultry or poultry products can be a source of infection. Countries located along migratory routes need to be vigilant for signs of disease in wild and domestic birds.

"(' 7 November 2005 Today, the Angolan Ministry of Health has declared the Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak over. The largest and deadliest outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever on record* In mid-March the Angola Ministry of Health (MOH) along with WHO actively investigated reports of 63 deaths (mostly children and three health care workers) among patients at the Uige Provincial Hospital, Angola. On 21 March, Marburg haemorrhagic fever was identified as the cause of the outbreak by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Following the laboratory confirmation, the MOH asked WHO to mobilize technical assistance and financial aid to help control the outbreak. The international response to the outbreak in Angola began on 22 March. The team from WHO, included experts from the Inter-country programme for southern Africa, the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and from Headquarters, and partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). (see below the list of partners and organizations who worked with the Ministry of Health to control the outbreak). In addition Médecins sans Frontières (Belgium, France, Holland and Spain) assisted with infection control and established isolation facilities in Uige, Luanda, Songo and Negage hospitals. The Angolan Government, WHO and other partners, established a surveillance system for identification of suspected cases and follow up of their contacts. Mobile teams were sent to the field to investigate rumours, obtain clinical specimens for laboratory tests, hospitalize suspected patients and monitor their contacts. A portable field laboratory established by the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory began operating in Uige on 4 April and a second laboratory operated by the US CDC in Luanda became operational on 10 April. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly. The disease spread particularly among people exposed to the Marburg virus during home care or at funerals, via contact with body fluids of those who died from the disease. The dangerous use of home-based injections was also identified as a major cause of the outbreak\'s spread. Early in the outbreak there was considerable confusion among the local population due to mistrust of the health-care system. Most preferred home- based care given by their traditional healers or family members. Intensive social mobilization campaigns were implemented successfully in the whole province to restore confidence and trust. A key element of the strategy was to include in the team traditional healers, pastors, teachers and community workers and to use a wide variety of communication formats. Guidance from two medical anthropologists, from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, who joined the outbreak control team was also critical for the community compliance with outbreak control measures.

The case is a 31-year-old female farmer from the north-eastern province of Liaoning. She developed symptoms on 30 October and subsequently underwent extensive hospital care for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. She recovered and was discharged from hospital on 29 November. Initial tests on this case produced negative results for infection with the H5 virus subtype. Diagnostic confirmation was made following antibody testing using a microneutralization test. Using this test, a positive diagnosis is made when antibody levels in a blood sample taken late in illness are at least four times higher than those found in a sample taken early in illness. Diagnostic confirmation using antibody tests, though reliable, is thus slower than that achieved using direct tests for virus RNA. Beginning in late October, Chinese authorities have reported several outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in Liaoning Province. Investigation of this case has linked the woman’s infection to direct exposure to diseased poultry. Agricultural authorities have detected the H5N1 virus in samples taken from poultry in the province. As a precaution, local authorities placed contacts of the woman under medical observation pending definitive laboratory results. No signs of influenza-like illness were detected, and all contacts have now been released from observation. This is China’s fifth laboratory-confirmed case. Of these cases, two were fatal.

The team has met with officials in the country’s ministries of health and agriculture and is now assessing the situation in hospitals, laboratories, and animals. A list of immediate needs for support has been established. Government officials have expressed a need for emergency supplies and equipment, including antiviral drugs, and these have already begun to arrive in the country. A 24-hour emergency operations centre has been set up in the WHO regional office in Cairo to facilitate coordination and provide back-up support.

Ways to strengthen local testing capacity are being explored together with ways to expedite the shipment of samples to WHO reference laboratories. The team has noted a need to upgrade biosafety standards in local and national laboratories. Intensive culling of poultry is under way in the area; improved diagnostic capacity for poultry is needed to focus these efforts better. Training to enhance the diagnostic capacity of veterinary laboratories and improve surveillance has already begun. Requests for essential supplies, including diagnostic reagents, are being met. The area has around 1.3 million poultry mainly raised by individual households, who depend on these animals for income and food. Discussions are under way to develop a compensation scheme that could lessen the hardship on these families. The team found a good system in place for detecting and managing possible human cases, collecting specimens, and tracing and monitoring contacts. Some improvements in isolation wards are planned. Intensive training courses are being organized for hospital staff to ensure that proper measures for personal protection and infection control are in place. Two patients hospitalized for observation have been discharged, though their condition continues to be monitored by local health teams.

Estimations from a mathematical model indicate that 110 000 people may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 in La Réunion, including 22 000 persons during the week 6 to 12 February. During the first week of February, other countries in the south west Indian Ocean have reported cases: Mauritius (206 cases) and the Seychelles (1 255 cases). Because of the extensive outbreaks in the region, WHO is planning to send a team from the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and headquarters to assess the control measures under way. These include anti-vectoral activities; an extensive public health education campaign using mass media to sensitize the population about protective measures; and reinforcement of epidemiological surveillance and vectoral surveillance. The team will discuss a sub-regional strategy for surveillance and control of chikungunya and other arboviruses with national authorities. They will visit La Réunion, Madagascar, Mauritius and coordinate with the AFRO vector control mission to the Seychelles. Chikungunya, a viral disease, is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, typically Aedes aegypti, although there may be other competent mosquito vectors. The name, chickungunya, comes from the Swahili for stooped walk, reflecting the physique of a person suffering from the disease. The disease has been described in Africa, South-East Asia, southern India and Pakistan. It occurs principally during the rainy season. Chikungunya is rarely fatal. Symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito. A high fever and headache occur, with significant pains in the joints (ankles, wrists) and can persist for several weeks. The main preventive measure is to stop the proliferation of mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds. #### For more information ',)",1722
"(' 22 February 2006 The outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry, confirmed at a commercial farm in Kaduna State on 8 February, has now spread to commercial farms in several other contiguous states. No human cases have been detected to date. Nigerian officials have confirmed outbreaks at commercial farms in the states of Kano, Plateau, Katsina, and Bauchi, and in the Abuja area. Outbreaks have also been detected at more farms in Kaduna. Outbreaks in additional states are currently under investigation. To date, four patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of exposure to diseased poultry have been investigated for possible infection. This number includes a woman who died of an acute respiratory illness on 16 February. The three remaining patients are all in good condition. Arrangements are being made to send samples from all four patients for testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. The initial outbreak in Kaduna state is now known to have begun on 10 January, raising the possibility that earlier human exposures and cases may have occurred in that area and elsewhere. At hospitals in Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina near affected farms, staff from the WHO-led teams have now examined hundreds of patient records, searching for possible cases that may have occurred earlier. No such cases have been identified to date. The scale of the outbreak in birds is not yet fully understood. Most investigations have followed poultry deaths on large commercial farms, where outbreaks are highly visible. Little is known about the presence of the virus in small backyard flocks, where the greatest risk of human exposures and infections resides. Nigeria has an estimated poultry population of around 140 million birds, largely concentrated in the south-western part of the country. As is the case in several affected parts of South-east Asia, around 60% of Nigeria’s poultry production takes place in small backyard flocks. Large-scale commercial farming of poultry occurs mainly in the northern states, where outbreaks have been confirmed. Rapid spread of the virus within Nigeria has raised concern over possible spread to neighbouring countries. Borders are porous and restrictions on the movement of people and poultry are difficult to enforce. WHO staff at offices in these countries are monitoring the situation closely in collaboration with government officials. Rumours of possible human cases in neighbouring countries are also being closely monitored. ',)",4

"(' 28 February 2006 Authorities in Germany have today announced detection of H5N1 avian influenza in a domestic cat. The cat was found dead over the weekend on the northern island of Ruegen. Since mid-February, more than 100 wild birds have died on the island, and tests have confirmed H5N1 infection in several. There is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. To date, no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat. No outbreaks in domestic cats have been reported. Unlike the case in domestic and wild birds, there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus. All available evidence indicates that cat infections occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in domestic or wild birds. Experimental studies, published in September 2004, demonstrated that the H5N1 virus can infect domestic cats, and that cats can transmit the virus to other cats. In these experiments, the cats developed disease following direct inoculation of virus isolated from a fatal human case, and following the feeding of infected raw chicken. The current H5N1 panzootic in birds, which began in mid-2003 in parts of South-East Asia, has been accompanied by a few anecdotal reports of H5N1 infection in domestic cats. In all such reports, eating raw infected poultry was considered the most likely source of infection for the cats. Several published studies have demonstrated H5N1 infection in large cats kept in captivity. In December 2003, two tigers and two leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, died unexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identified H5N1 in tissue samples. In February 2004, the virus was detected in a clouded leopard that died at a zoo near Bangkok. A white tiger died from infection with the virus at the same zoo in March 2004. In October 2004, captive tigers fed on fresh chicken carcasses began dying in large numbers at a zoo in Thailand. Altogether 147 tigers out of 441 died of infection or were euthanized. Subsequent investigation determined that at least some tiger-to-tiger transmission of the virus occurred. ',)",0

"(' 9 March 2006 Officials in Germany have today confirmed H5N1 infection in a second mammalian species, the stone marten. This finding marks the first documented infection of this species with an avian influenza virus. Previously, H5N1 infection was confirmed in Germany in three domestic cats. The marten was found alive, but showing signs of severe illness, on the Baltic island of Ruegen on 2 March. The animal was euthanized. Tests conducted at Germany’s Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut for Animal Health confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The ill animal was found in the same heavily affected area of the island, near Schaprode, as three dead domestic cats. Tests conducted at the Friedrich- Loeffler-Institut subsequently confirmed that all three cats were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The stone marten is a predatory nocturnal mammal with feeding habits similar to those of domestic cats. As with the cats found on Ruegen island, the marten is presumed to have acquired its infection after feeding on an infected bird. Since 16 February, German authorities have confirmed H5N1 infection in 125 wild swans, ducks, geese, and birds of prey on Ruegen Island, pointing to considerable opportunities for exposures to occur in small mammals that feed on birds. As is the case with humans, infections in animal species other than birds are rare events. To date, only domestic poultry are known to have played a role in the transmission cycle of the virus from animals to humans. In July 2005, tests on three rare Owston’s palm civets that died in captivity in Viet Nam detected H5N1 infection, marking the first known infection in this mammalian species. Large cats, including tigers and leopards, kept in capacity and fed on infected poultry carcasses, have also been infected and developed severe disease. Ferrets are another mammalian species known to be susceptible to infection. Further investigation is needed to determine whether evidence of H5N1 infection in new mammalian species has any significance for the risk of human infection or the potential of this virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.

"(' 10 March 2006 Since the beginning of March, the Ministry of Health in Azerbaijian has been investigating a cluster of 10 persons placed under observation for possible infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. All of these persons are from the Daikyand settlement in Salyan Rayon in the eastern part of the country. The Salyan Rayon is located near wetlands frequented by migratory birds. Recent deaths of poultry have been reported in the Daikyand settlement, but the cause of these deaths has not yet been determined. The investigation was launched when two young women, who were neighbours, died within a week of each other. The first patient, a 17-year-old girl, died on 23 February. She was reported to have suffered for more than a year from respiratory symptoms associated with a neoplastic condition. Her death is now thought to have been caused by this pre-existing disease. As a precaution, samples have been taken and will be sent for H5N1 testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. The second death occurred on 3 March in a 20-year-old woman who died following rapidly progressive acute pneumonia, which is a characteristic feature in many cases of H5N1 infection. Immediately following the second death, the Ministry of Health initiated daily house-to-house investigations, conducted by four teams of hospital staff, looking for persons in the settlement having respiratory symptoms or fever. As a result, an additional 8 persons were hospitalized for observation. Of these, six showed only mild symptoms. They have fully recovered and have now been discharged from hospital. Of the remaining two patients, one, a 17-year-old girl, died on 8 March. A 16-year-old boy remains hospitalized in isolation. His condition is critical. The response of the Ministry of Health has been prompt and efficient, but hampered by the lack of some essential equipment and supplies and inadequate diagnostic capacity. Prior to the event, staff from the Ministry of Health had visited offices of sanitary hygiene and epidemiology in each rayon within the country, creating a high level of awareness of the disease and a correspondingly high level of alert for possible cases of unusual respiratory disease. The house-to-house surveillance for cases is continuing. A WHO team is presently in Azerbaijan to assess needs and provide technical support to health officials. The team will be augmented on Monday with additional expertise and supplies, including laboratory equipment and diagnostic reagents. Samples have been collected by local officials and shipment to the WHO-affiliated laboratory is expected to take place early next week. Supplies of the antiviral drug oseltamivir are available in Azerbaijan, but the quantity is limited. To date, all patients under investigation have received treatment with this drug. Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was initially confirmed in Azerbaijan on 9 February in wild birds found in the coastal area near the capital city of Baku. On 24 February, the country announced detection of infection in poultry at farms in Khyzy (in the north-eastern part of the country) and Bilasuvar (near Salyan). Some 300,000 birds were culled as a result. ',)",10

Estimations from a mathematical model evaluate that 204 000 people may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 on La Réunion, including 13 000 persons during the week 27 February - 5 March 2006. Between 1 January 2006 - 5 March 2006, 25 patients with clinical symptoms consistent with dengue fever were laboratory confirmed. Five were isolated cases and 20 were suspected cases of co-infection chikungunya-dengue. Since the beginning of January 2006, other countries in the south west Indian Ocean have reported chikungunya cases: Mayotte (9 January - 10 March, 2833 suspected cases), Mauritius (1 January - 5 March c. 6000 suspected cases including 1200 confirmed cases), and the Seychelles (1 January - 26 February, 8818 suspected cases). Several European countries have reported imported cases in people returning from these islands: France (160 imported cases), Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland. A mixed outbreak of chikungunya, with sporadic cases of dengue has been reported in Andhra Pradesh state, India. Between 1 December 2005 - 17 February 2006, 5671 cases of fever with arthralgia were reported. High density of Aedes aegypti was observed in the area. From 1-15 March, over 2000 cases of chikungunya have been reported from Malegaon town in Nasik district, Maharashtra state, India. In Orissa state, India, 4904 cases of fever associated with myalgia and headache have been reported between 27 February - 5 March 2006. These signs are consistent with an arbovirus outbreak. Results of a biological investigation are awaited. Dengue in Madagascar and Maldives Madagascar has reported a dengue outbreak in the port city of Toamasina. The outbreak started mid-January 2006. Sporadic cases of chikungunya have been reported since mid-February. Maldives has experienced an outbreak of dengue since January 2006, with 602 suspected cases until 5 March 2006 (including 64 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever and 9 cases of dengue shock syndrome). Chikungunya and dengue viruses are transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. On La Réunion, Mauritius, the Seychelles and the east coast of Madagascar, Aedes aegypti is absent or scarce in the vicinity of houses. In contrast, Ae. albopictus is abundant and may be the only important vector of these viruses on the islands. In the Maldives Ae. aegypti is the presumed vector. Both species bite mainly during the daytime, particularly in the early hours after dawn and for 2-3 hours before darkness. Aedes albopictus is more active outdoors whereas Ae. aegypti typically feeds and rests more indoors. Mosquito control is the main outbreak control activity. Close to habitation, these two mosquito species multiply in collections of stagnant water, mostly in artificial containers. To control the mosquitoes, their breeding sites must be removed, destroyed, protected, frequently emptied and cleaned, or treated with insecticides. During epidemics, insecticides are also often applied as space sprays to kill the adult mosquitoes. Such measures require the mobilization of affected communities to carry out critical, well-identified healthy behaviours. The Communications for Behavioural Impact (COMBI) approach is a powerful strategy to support this mobilization process both in individuals and communities. Control measures A WHO team from the Regional Office for Africa and from headquarters was deployed to the south west Indian Ocean in February-March 2006 to assess the control measures under way in the islands and to discuss a sub-regional coordinated strategy for surveillance and control of arboviruses in the area with national authorities. (see previous report). Additional expertise in the COMBI approach has been sent to Madagascar and Mauritius for follow-up. Similarly, Maldives has received support for their social mobilization activities on dengue vector control. In India, a multidisciplinary national team was deployed from 13 -17 February 2006 to assist local health authorities in improving public health measures including strengthening of arbovirus surveillance, clinical management of cases, vector control and social mobilization. Although transmission of chikungunya and dengue is continuing in the affected areas, WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from these areas.

"(' 31 May 2006 Situation update Indonesian health authorities and WHO have further strengthened their response to the family cluster of cases in Kubu Simbelang village, Karo District, North Sumatra. As of today, 54 surviving family members and other close contacts of cases have been identified and placed under voluntary home quarantine. All of these people, with the exception of pregnant women and infants, are receiving the antiviral drug, oseltamivir, for prophylactic purposes. Public health teams visit these people daily, checking for symptoms. In addition, active house-to-house surveillance for influenza-like illness is being conducted throughout the village, which has around 400 households. A command post for fever surveillance has been functioning in the village since last week. As of today, no new cases suggestive of H5N1 infection have been detected since 22 May. This finding is important as it indicates that the virus has not spread beyond the members of this single extended family. No hospital staff involved in the care of patients, in some instances without adequate personal protective equipment, have developed the disease. The last person in the cluster, who developed symptoms on 15 May and died on 22 May, refused hospitalization. He moved between two villages while ill, accompanied by his wife. The wife is under surveillance and has not developed symptoms. Despite multiple opportunities for the virus to spread to other family members, health care workers or into the general community, it has not, on present evidence, done so. Current level of pandemic alert Based on an assessment of present evidence, WHO has concluded that the current level of pandemic alert is appropriate and does not need to change. The level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3. This phase pertains to a situation in which occasional human infections with a novel influenza virus are occurring, but there is no evidence that the virus is spreading in an efficient and sustained manner from one person to another. WHO has recommended continued close monitoring of the situation in Kubu Simbelang for the two weeks following 22 May, the date when the last known case in the cluster died. As a precautionary measure, Indonesian authorities have decided to extend this recommended period to three weeks. Preliminary results of the investigation This information differs in some details from information released in previous updates, but is derived from extensive investigations by senior national and international epidemiologists, from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have developed a clearer picture of the situation. The cluster involves an initial case and seven subsequent laboratory-confirmed cases. All cases are members of an extended family: sisters and brothers and their children. Family members resided in four households. Three households were next-door neighbours in the village of Kubu Simbelang, Karo District, North Sumatra. The fourth household was located about 10 kilometres away in the nearby village of Kabanjahe. The initial case in the cluster was a 37-year-old woman who sold fruits and chillies at a market in the village of Tigapanah. Her stand was located about 15 metres away from a stand where live chickens were sold. The investigation uncovered no reports of poultry die-offs in the market. However, the woman kept a small number of backyard chickens, allowed into the house at night. Three of her chickens reportedly died before she became ill. She is also known to have used chicken faeces from these household chickens as fertilizer in her garden. A parallel agricultural investigation has not, to date, detected H5N1 virus in PCR tests of approximately 80 samples from poultry, other livestock and domestic pets, and chicken fertilizer taken from the vicinity. The initial case developed symptoms on 24 April, was hospitalized on 2 May, and died on 4 May. No samples were collected for testing prior to her burial, but she is considered part of the cluster as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection. The initial case had one sister and three brothers. The sister and two of the brothers subsequently developed infection. The remaining cases occurred among children in these families. The confirmed cases include five males and two females with an average age of 19 years (range from 1 to 32 years). Six out of the seven confirmed cases developed symptoms between 3 May and 5 May. These cases include two sons of the initial case, her brother from Kabanjahe, her sister, the sister’s baby, and the son of a second brother living in an adjacent house. This second brother, the last case in the cluster, developed symptoms on 15 May. Six out of the seven cases were fatal. Exposures On the night of 29 April, nine family members spent the night in a small room with the initial case at a time when she was severely ill, prostrate, and coughing heavily. These family members included the initial case and her three sons; the brother from Kabanjahe village, his wife, and their two children; the 21-year-old daughter of another brother (who did not become infected); and another young male visitor. Following this event, three family members – the woman’s two sons and the visiting brother from Kabanjahe – developed symptoms from 5 to 6 days later. The woman’s sister, who lived in an adjacent house, developed symptoms at the same time, as did her 18-month-old daughter. Prior to symptom onset, this sister, accompanied by her daughter, provided close personal care of the initial case. The last case in the cluster provided close care for his son throughout his hospital stay, from 9–13 May. The son was a frequent visitor in the home of the initial case and was present there on 29 April. ',)",8

"(' 7 June 2006 Thirty-four suspect cases with sudden paralysis are under investigation, mostly in the Windhoek area of Namibia, of which three have been confirmed as wild poliovirus. What is thought to be the first case is a 39-year old man with onset of paralysis on 8 May, later confirmed as infected with wild poliovirus type-1. The majority of suspect cases are over 20 years old; seven of the individuals have died. National health authorities are planning a response to an outbreak of wild poliovirus in Namibia, polio-free since 1996. An investigation of the outbreak – which unusually appears to be affecting mostly adults – is currently under way. Genetic sequencing confirms that the virus is consistent with an importation from Angola, of Indian origin. Angola, polio-free since 2001, was re-infected last year by a virus from India. The Government is planning an immunization response consisting of three National Immunization Days (NIDs), using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1). The first NID could be conducted as early as 21 June, and will aim to reach the entire population of the country (two million), rather than the usual under-five year population. The age of any further cases will dictate the target age groups for the two subsequent NIDs. An international team is in the country to assist the national authorities. Namibia began routine immunization for polio in 1990. While the cause of the largely adult outbreak is yet to be determined, it is likely that those who fell ill did not receive immunization as children. Routine immunization coverage within Namibia today varies by region from 60% to 80%. #### For more information ',)",34

Epidemiological curves are still rising in the provinces from which the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases have originated, Kirkuk (2309) and Sulaymaniah (870). An increasing number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea has also been reported in Diala, a province neighbouring Baghdad. Although V. cholerae has not yet been laboratory confirmed, the clinical symptoms indicate the presence of cholera. The numbers of cases are remaining stable in Basra, Baghdad, Dahuk, Mosul and Tikrit. However, a case has now been confirmed in Wasit, a province that has previously been unaffected by the outbreak. The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. However, the overall quality of water and sanitation is very poor, a factor known to greatly facilitate cholera contamination. WHO is in the process of procuring 5,000,000 water-treatment tablets and two international WHO epidemiologists are being deployed to support the Ministry of Health in Iraq. WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera. However, neighbouring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security. Use of the current internationally available prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated with its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the high occurrence of severe adverse reactions. ### For more information ',)",>30000
"(' 3 October 2007 The Ministry of Health has confirmed that, as of 2 October 2007, a total of 25 out of 76 suspected cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever from the province of Kasai Occidental have now tested positive for the disease. A further 187 contacts are currently under medical observation and will remain so until each has reached the end of their respective potential incubation periods without developing any symptoms of the disease. Although there is now strong clinical and epidemiological evidence to suggest that the outbreak is slowing, identifying and isolating all suspect cases is still a priority for the response teams to ensure that the chains of transmission are broken. This includes following up any contacts over the incubation period in order to isolate them immediately if they become ill. Two consecutive incubation periods must elapse, a total of 42 days following the identification and isolation of the last confirmed case, before the outbreak is considered controlled. The international response team, with the participation of members of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, is continuing to work with the Ministry of Health in all areas of disease control including community health education, social mobilization, contact tracing, clinical management, infection control in health facilities and rapid on-site laboratory diagnosis.

"(' 7 November 2007 Human cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) continue to increase, with 228 cases and 84 deaths reported as of 7 November. Fifteen localities in White Nile, Sinnar, and Gazeera states are affected. More than 25 human samples have proved positive for Rift Valley fever by PCR or ELISA testing. Laboratory results from three cases in Khartoum state have been found negative for RVF. Results of tests on animal samples remain unavailable. The appearance of RVF disease in humans is typically preceded by infection in animals. The RVF virus circulates between ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) via mosquitoes. During an outbreak, the most significant risk factor for human infection is close contact with infected domestic animals, particularly with their body fluids either directly or via aerosols. However, at times of high vector densities the relative importance of mosquito-to-human transmission may increase. With no specific treatment and no effective human vaccine, intensive social mobilization to raise awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection and the protective measures individuals can take to prevent exposure, is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths. During RVF outbreaks, intensive public health messages for risk reduction should focus on: * reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission as a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn and care taken when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals. * reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue. In the epizootic regions, all animal products (blood, meat and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating. * the importance of personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, by wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species. WHO continues to work closely with the Sudan Ministry of Health, as well as other UN and international bodies to support an effective control program for protecting human populations. ### For more information ',)",228

It is anticipated that following this declaration, a well-integrated control program for limiting the disease in both human and animal populations will now be implemented. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has deployed a senior animal health expert to the country to assist veterinary services with prevention and control measures in animals. The Ministry of Health and WHO Country Office have presented a plan for the prevention and control of the disease in humans to international donors in Khartoum. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office and WHO headquarters are supporting the national response, mobilizing epidemiologists and working with partners to enhance national laboratory capacity for RVF.

It is anticipated that additional unreported cases may be occurring within communities among patients preferring to remain at home or to receive treatment from traditional healers. The clinical symptoms of the disease are extreme drowsiness, waking only to painful stimuli. Patients recover slowly, over a number of days, but remain ataxic with many unable to walk unaided. The symptoms are most extreme in children. The neurological indication is of a cerebellar abnormality with no sign of peripheral neuropathy. Reflexes are normal. The case presentation suggests a toxicological cause, however, the etiological agent has not yet been identified. Samples taken from patients have been tested for 300 organic solvents and a general drug screen covering 800 compounds has also been carried out. These tests have so far proved negative. Tests for cadmium, lead, mercury and manganese have shown levels within the normal range.

In addition 15 cases including 3 deaths were reported in Khartoum State, but they were most likely infected in the other affected areas. Gazeera State continues to report the most human cases, and now accounts for 271 cases and 100 deaths. In RVF outbreaks, the vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes. Humans may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk or meat of infected animals. Key public health measures include social mobilization, to help people who come into contact with cattle, sheep and other animals, to adopt safe handling and slaughtering practices; epidemiological measures such as active case finding; supportive clinical measures; vector control to stop the spread of disease, primarily between animals but also from animals to humans; and laboratory diagnosis capacity. The national response to the outbreak is being managed by an inter-ministerial Task Force, with the participation, inter alia, of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries. This Task Force is responsible for managing integrated action to control the spread of the disease and to decrease the impact on human and animal health. In support of the Task Force, State and Federal Ministers of Health met on 20 November to discuss the response activities and called for systematic measures to control the spread of disease in animal populations, including controls on animal movement.

The overall case fatality rate has decreased from 11% during March 10-31 to 0.2% during April 17-29. The number of hospitalised cases has gradually increased since the end of March with a sharp increase in the number of cases since April 19. Public health experts predict that the number of cases will continue to increase and will peak around June-July. Retrospective case investigation has revealed that sporadic cases had occurred since the beginning of March. Cases have been reported from all over Fuyang city. Testing for a variety of respiratory diseases of the initial cases did not reveal any conclusive results. Subsequently, additional testing and several expert consultations were conducted at the national level. On April 23, EV-71 was confirmed. Health authorities informed WHO and Hong Kong SAR Department of Health and the Province of Taiwan's Department of Health immediately on these results. Chinese health authorities have put in place targeted prevention and control measures in Fuyang city and Anhui Province, including enhanced surveillance, training of health care workers at all levels in treatment, prevention and control, strengthening of environmental health management, and the supervision and monitoring of drinking water quality. A public awareness campaign is ongoing, stressing the need for good personal hygiene, mostly by hand washing. Non-polio enteroviruses are common and distributed worldwide. Although infection often has no symptoms and goes unnoticed, these viruses are also associated with occasional outbreaks in which a larger-than-usual number of patients develop clinical disease, sometimes with fatal consequences. No specific anti-viral therapy is available and treatment focuses on prevention of complications. As there is no vaccine for this virus, control measures during outbreaks are focused on classical hygiene measures including frequent hand-washing and disinfection of soiled clothing and surfaces. In certain situations, it may be advisable to close child-care facilities and schools to reduce the intensity of transmission. It is not necessary to restrict travel or trade. Currently many countries in the Western Pacific region have implemented heightened surveillance for hand, foot and mouth disease and for severe complications in children. ### For more information "",)",1884

In addition, an epidemiologist and three data managers from the WHO Inter-country Support Team in Harare are assisting the WHO Country Office in data monitoring, analysis and mapping. Communities are being encouraged to protect themselves against cholera by adhering to proper food safety practices as well as to good personal hygiene. Early rehydration at home by using oral rehydration salts is paramount to diminishing mortality. Mass chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security. Once an outbreak has started, WHO does not recommend the use of the current internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine. This is due to its 2-dose regimen, the time required to reach protective efficacy and the high cost and heavy logistics associated with its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the occurrence of severe adverse events. In controlling the spread of cholera, WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. However, neighbouring countries are encouraged to strengthen their active surveillance and preparedness systems. ',)",11735

In fact, the epidemiological week ending 20 December saw over 5 000 new cases - an increase in the number of weekly cases relative to previous weeks - and an increase in deaths outside treatment/health centres. The overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has risen to 5.7% - far above the 1% which is normal in large outbreaks - and in some rural areas it has reached as high as 50%. Mortality outside of healthcare facilities remains very high. This is a clear indication that better case management and access to healthcare is needed - in particular an increased use of oral rehydration therapy with Oral Rehydration Salts in communities very early after onset of the disease. The outbreak has taken on a subregional dimension with cases being reported from neighboring countries.

"("" 24 April 2009 - The United States Government has reported seven confirmed human cases of Swine Influenza A/H1N1 in the USA (five in California and two in Texas) and nine suspect cases. All seven confirmed cases had mild Influenza-Like Illness (ILI), with only one requiring brief hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. The Government of Mexico has reported three separate events. In the Federal District of Mexico, surveillance began picking up cases of ILI starting 18 March. The number of cases has risen steadily through April and as of 23 April there are now more than 854 cases of pneumonia from the capital. Of those, 59 have died. In San Luis Potosi, in central Mexico, 24 cases of ILI, with three deaths, have been reported. And from Mexicali, near the border with the United States, four cases of ILI, with no deaths, have been reported. Of the Mexican cases, 18 have been laboratory confirmed in Canada as Swine Influenza A/H1N1, while 12 of those are genetically identical to the Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses from California. The majority of these cases have occurred in otherwise healthy young adults. Influenza normally affects the very young and the very old, but these age groups have not been heavily affected in Mexico. Because there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus, and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks, plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected, these events are of high concern. The Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses characterized in this outbreak have not been previously detected in pigs or humans. The viruses so far characterized have been sensitive to oseltamivir, but resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine. The World Health Organization has been in constant contact with the health authorities in the United States, Mexico and Canada in order to better understand the risk which these ILI events pose. WHO (and PAHO) is sending missions of experts to Mexico to work with health authorities there. It is helping its Member States to increase field epidemiology activities, laboratory diagnosis and clinical management. Moreover, WHO's partners in the Global Alert and Response Network have been alerted and are ready to assist as requested by the Member States.

WPV3 from northern Nigeria has this year spread internationally to Niger. Since February 2009, there has also been an increasing number of polio cases due to a type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) in northern Nigeria (103 cases to date in 2009 compared to 31 cases for the same period in 2008). Both serotypes are at continued, and in the case of the cVDPV2 increasing, risk of international spread. While the number of cVDPV2 cases is lower than WPV3 cases, circulation of this serotype is of particular international concern as the last case of polio due to a circulating wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) was in 1999. In response to these risks, Nigeria has conducted nationwide polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with monovalent OPV type 3 (mOPV3) in late January 2009 and with trivalent OPV from 30 May to 2 June. Additional SIAs are planned for later in the year, including an SIA with trivalent OPV for August. To minimize the risk and consequences of international spread of these polioviruses, countries across west and central Africa, particularly those bordering the affected states of northern Nigeria, should enhance surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), identify subnational population immunity gaps, and strengthen routine immunization with trivalent OPV.

"("" On 28 October 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine informed WHO, through its Country Office in Ukraine, about an unusually high level of activity of acute respiratory illness in the western part of the country, associated with an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities. On 30 October 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine announced the confirmation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection by RT-PCR in eleven out of 30 samples obtained from patients presenting with acute respiratory illness in two of the most affected regions. Tests were performed in two laboratories in Kyiv, including the National Influenza Centre. Confirmatory tests will be performed at one of the WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza. The situation is quickly changing with increasingly high levels of acute respiratory illness (ARI)/Influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity being observed in Ternopil, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernivtsi regions. The higher levels of transmission in these regions corresponds to an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities associated with severe manifestations of acute respiratory illness. As of 30 October 2009, over 2,300 individuals have been admitted to hospital, including over 1,100 children. One hundred and thirty one (131) cases have required intensive care, including 32 children. As of 31 October 2009, a total of 38 fatalities associated with severe manifestations of ARI have been registered. Preliminary epidemiological data analysis indicates that severe cases and deaths primarily occur among previously healthy young adults aged 20 – 50 years. Fatal and severe cases are reported to have sought medical attention 5 to 7 days after onset of symptoms. International experience of the (H1N1) 2009 pandemic to date, especially from the Southern Hemisphere, has shown that poor clinical outcomes are associated with delays in seeking health care and limited access to supportive care. In addition, this virus has also shown its ability to cause rapidly progressive overwhelming lung disease which is very difficult to treat. Public health measures recommended by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine across the entire country include: social distancing (school closures and cancellation of mass gatherings); enhancement of surveillance activities; increased respiratory hygiene; and continuation of the vaccination campaign against seasonal influenza targeting at risk groups. The Government of the Ukraine has activated coordination mechanisms to respond to the rapidly evolving situation, including the harmonization of response plans across all administrative levels. In response to the request from the Minister of Health of Ukraine, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of experts to assist national authorities in mitigating the impact of the pandemic. The team comprises of the following expertise: health emergencies coordination, case management, epidemiology, laboratory diagnostics, logistics, and media/risk communications. As per WHO's communication in May 2009, there is no rationale for travel restrictions because such measures will not prevent the spread of the disease. Travellers can protect themselves and others by following simple recommendations aimed at preventing the spread of infection such as attention to respiratory hygiene. Individuals who are ill should delay travel plans and returning travellers who fall ill should seek appropriate medical care. These recommendations are prudent measures which can limit the spread of many communicable diseases and not only the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. "",)",2300
"(' 3 November 2009 - According to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the country has now recorded more than 250 000 cases of influenza-like illness, with 235 patients requiring intensive care. As of 2 November, 70 deaths from acute respiratory illness have been reported. Regions in western Ukraine continue to show the highest rates of acute respiratory illness/influenza-like illness. The level of activity in the Kyiv area is also increasing rapidly. Laboratory testing in Ukraine has confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in samples taken from patients in two of the most affected regions. As the pandemic virus has rapidly become the dominant influenza strain worldwide, it can be assumed that most cases of influenza in Ukraine are caused by the H1N1 virus. As elsewhere, WHO strongly recommends early treatment with the antiviral drugs, oseltamivir or zanamivir, for patients who meet treatment criteria, even in the absence of a positive laboratory test confirming H1N1 infection. At the request of the government, a multi-disciplinary team of nine experts has been deployed by WHO and arrived in Kyiv yesterday evening. Discussions with the Minister of Health were held this morning to brief the team. Team members will now begin field investigations to characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of the outbreak. Work will initially begin in Lviv region, where reported numbers of cases showing severe manifestations of acute respiratory illness have been especially high. Two virologists on the team have started working at the National Influenza Centre and the laboratories of the Central Sanitary and Epidemiological Station in Kyiv to provide diagnostic support. Samples sent by the Ministry of Health were received today by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Mill Hill in London, UK. The laboratory will conduct confirmatory tests and further characterize the virus. Many questions remain to be answered. The outbreak in Ukraine may be indicative of how the virus can behave in the northern hemisphere during the winter season, particularly in health care settings typically found in Eastern Europe. Given the potential significance of this outbreak as an early warning signal, WHO commends the government of Ukraine for its transparent reporting and open sharing of samples. WHO continues to recommend no closing of borders and no restrictions on international travel, including to Ukraine. Experience shows that such measures will not stop further spread of the virus.

"("" 23 July 2010 - The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan has since 1 January 2010 reported 430 cases of polio following the importation of a wild poliovirus type 1 into the country. Nineteen of the cases were fatal. Seven virologically related cases have been detected in the Russian Federation, the only other country in the WHO European Region to confirm cases. The poliovirus causing the outbreak originated in northern India. This is the first outbreak of polio since the Region was certified polio-free in 2002. In response to the outbreak, four rounds of national immunization days (NIDs) with oral polio vaccine have been held in Tajikistan. Coverage was reported to be high and confirmed by independent monitors. The most recent round was conducted on 15–19 June (except in Dushanbe and six surrounding regions, where it started on 13 June). Preliminary data report nationwide coverage of 99.3%. Coverage higher than 97% is reported from all regions and in the groups aged 0–6 and 7–15 years. The most recent polio case had onset on 12 June, and the number of new cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) – of which polio can be one of the causes – being detected and reported to WHO has dropped sharply. However, there is not sufficient virological testing data from the recent AFP cases to revise WHO's assessment of the risk for further international spread, which remains 'high'. A joint national/international surveillance review is under way, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, to further inform the current risk assessment and guide additional surveillance and immunization activities. The need for additional rounds of mass oral polio vaccine (OPV) immunization will be based on an ongoing evaluation of epidemiological and laboratory data. International travellers to and from polio affected areas should continue to be adequately immunized against polio as recommended in Chapter 6 of International Travel and Health guidance. The European Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication met in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 28–29 June 2010. Addressing the meeting, Ms Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, noted that the outbreak in Tajikistan threatens both the polio-free status of the Region and the eradication of polio globally. The Commission recognized that the European Region has reached a critical juncture and its polio-free status is in jeopardy. The gravity of the situation requires that all Member States reinforce their polio surveillance so that any spread will be detected rapidly and effective control measures instituted at the earliest possible moment. Neighbouring countries are responding to the outbreak by heightening surveillance while reviewing immunization status of children and conducting necessary supplementary immunization activities. Uzbekistan has held three national rounds of supplementary immunization with efforts to synchronize these rounds with Tajikistan in May and June.

Seasonal factors, such as the rainy season with flooding, as well as poor hygiene conditions and population movements in the area contribute to this unusually high incidence of cholera. Nevertheless this area known to be endemic for cholera is regularly affected by small outbreaks. WHO, with international and national health partners, is providing technical support to the ministries of health at the country and sub-regional levels. WHO is working to strengthen surveillance activities. Supplies for case management and chlorination of water have also been dispatched to some of the affected areas. The Ministries of Health of the four affected countries are planning to organize a cross border meeting in Abuja in order to reinforce the surveillance and revise the preparedness and response plans to cholera epidemics in the localities around Lake Chad. ### Breakdown by country: ##### Cameroon: 7 869 cases including 515 deaths (case fatality rate -CFR 6.5%) have been reported in 6 regions (Centre, Extreme Nord, Littoral, Nord, Ouest, Sud Ouest) between 6 May and 3 October. The majority of cases (97%) are reported from the Extreme Nord region. Preventive and control measures are ongoing. A Cholera Command and Control Centre has been set up in Maroua in the Extreme Nord region by the Ministry of Health with the support from WHO as health cluster lead and in close collaboration with other health and water and sanitation partners.

"(' 25 October 2010 - As of 15 October, the IHR National Focal Point, Ministry of Health (MoH), Pakistan, has notified WHO of 26 cases, including 3 deaths, of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). In addition, over 1500 laboratory- confirmed cases of dengue fever including 15 deaths have also been reported from Pakistan so far. Both CCHF and dengue fever are endemic in Pakistan with seasonal rise in cases. However, recently, the transmission of both CCHF and dengue fever has intensified in the country with increased incidence and geographic expansion. The recent Pakistan floods may have contributed to this upsurge as a result of changes in risk factors for these diseases. ##### Operational response The MoH has scaled up response activities to prevent and mitigate CCHF and dengue fever, including awareness-raising campaigns on exposure risks and preventive measures for the general public, strengthening clinical and case management of patients with haemorrhagic fevers, stockpiling appropriate drugs and personal protective equipment, and implementing targeted vector control activities. Upon request from the MoH in Pakistan, WHO is mobilizing experts in the clinical management of severe dengue fever and in infection control in health care settings through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). WHO is also assisting the country with resource mobilization, strengthening disease surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, and training of health care providers. ### FOR MORE INFORMATION ',)",26
"("" 28 October 2010 - As of 27 October, the Ministry of Health in Haiti (MSPP) reported 4 722 cholera cases including 303 deaths. The departments reporting confirmed cases are Artibonte (76.5%), Central (22.9%), Nord-Est, and Nord. Priorities of the Government of Haiti's National Response Strategy to the Cholera Epidemic are to protect families at the community level, to strengthen primary health care centers already operating across the nation, and to establish a network of Cholera Treatment Centers and designated hospitals for treatment of severe cases. The strains of Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa isolated in Haiti and tested by the National Public Health Laboratory (LNSP) and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed resistance to the following antibiotics: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, furazolidone, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin. The strains are sensitive to tetracycline, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. Full genetic sequencing of the strains is ongoing. #### PAHO/WHO Response Relief efforts continue as the government, MINUSTAH (The UN Stabilization Force in Haiti), UN agencies and NGOs continue to provide assistance in a growing number of locations. PAHO coordinates these efforts with other UN agencies, and with health officials in WHO Member States from the Region and beyond. PAHO continues to mobilize international experts in the areas of epidemiology, risk communication, case management, laboratory, water and sanitation, logistics, and LSS/SUMA (humanitarian supply management system) to Haiti and also to the Dominican Republic. Additional medical supplies including 50, 000 intravenous fluids (Ringer’s Lactate), and 10 diarrhoeal disease treatment kits sufficient to treat 400-500 severe cholera cases have been purchased with funding from the international corporation, expected to arrive shortly in Haiti. PAHO and US CDC experts are working together on improved surveillance and reporting of cases, analysis of water samples from rivers and other water sources, and monitoring of antibiotic resistance. To support the Haitian Ministry of Health's planning efforts and the contingency planning for the Dominican Republic, PAHO is working with the US CDC to develop modelling scenarios to project the dynamics and likely spread of the outbreak . However, even with the best modelling efforts, it will not be possible to accurately predict the course of the epidemic. WHO does not recommend any restrictions in travel and trade between countries or between different regions of a country experiencing cholera outbreaks. Travellers do not require proof of cholera vaccination, nor is there a need to screen travelers by means of rectal swabbing or faecal analysis. There is no need to establish quarantine measures at the border, a measure that diverts resources and may hamper cooperation between institutions and countries. ### FOR MORE INFORMATION "",)",4722
"("" 4 November 2010 - An acute outbreak of poliomyelitis is occurring in the Republic of Congo, with 120 cases of acute flaccid paralysis and 58 deaths. Half the cases have been reported in the past ten days, with the first case occurring in early October. Two cases have been confirmed to have been caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and laboratory testing continues. Most cases are in young adults: among those cases for which age data is available (43) at this time, 33 are between the ages of 15-25 years. Only one is under five years old, three are between 7 and 13 and five are between 26 and 58. The outbreak is due to imported poliovirus. Congo had recorded its last case of indigenous polio in 2000. Investigations are ongoing to determine definitively the origins of the virus. Nearly all cases have been reported from the port city of Pointe Noire, with cases also reported from Dolisie (2), Kayes, Bouenza, Brazzaville, and Mvouiti (one each). The Government of Congo has alerted the public to the outbreak and launched an emergency response plan, with support from key partners, including WHO, UNICEF and the US CDC. At least three nationwide vaccination campaigns are expected, using monovalent oral polio vaccine and targeting the entire population. The number, geographic extent and target age groups of further campaigns will be determined by the Government based on the evolving epidemiology. It is anticipated that a multi-country campaign will be required to cover bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported every day. It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of Africa strengthen AFP surveillance, in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also strengthen population immunity levels to minimise the consequences of any virus introduction. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International Travel and Health, guidance travellers to and from Angola and DR Congo should be fully protected by vaccination. Given the recent progress achieved in Nigeria (98% reduction in cases this year compared to the same period in 2009), very high priority is being given to rapidly controlling persistent transmission such as in Angola and stopping new outbreaks such as Congo. #### For more information "",)",120
"(' 9 November 2010 - 184 cases of acute flaccid paralysis and 85 deaths have been reported from the site of the acute poliomyelitis outbreak centred in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo. Four cases have been confirmed to have been caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and laboratory testing continues. The majority of the reported cases and deaths have occurred in the population aged over 15 years. Genetic sequencing has determined that the cases are caused by a poliovirus most closely related to that circulating in neighbouring Angola. Congo had recorded its last case of indigenous polio in 2000. Nearly all cases have been reported from the port city of Pointe Noire, with cases also reported from Niari (5), Bouenza (2), Brazzaville (1), and Kouilou (2). The Government of Congo has alerted the public to the outbreak and launched an emergency response plan, with support from key partners, including WHO, UNICEF and the US CDC. The first vaccination response, using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1), will start on Friday, 12 November, to cover the whole population of Porte Noire and Kouilou, in conjunction with the neighbouring province of Cabinda in Angola. The rest of Congo will be vaccinated starting 18 November using mOPV1. Two additional nationwide rounds are planned. The number, geographic extent and target age groups of further campaigns will be determined by the Government based on the evolving epidemiology. The multi- country campaign may be further expanded to cover additional bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported. Countries across central Africa should strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also address any gaps in polio immunization coverage to minimise the consequences of a poliovirus introduction. As per the recommendations in the WHO publication International Travel and Health, travellers to and from all countries where polio is circulating, including the Republic of Congo and Angola, should be fully protected by vaccination. Given the recent progress towards polio eradication in Nigeria (98% reduction in cases in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009), rapidly stopping the persistent poliovirus transmission in central Africa (i.e. Angola, DR Congo) and stopping new polio outbreaks such as in Congo, are top international disease control priorities. #### For more information ',)",184
"("" 13 November 2010 - The risk of further international spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in Central Asia and the North Caucasus Federal Region in Russia continues to be high. In Central Asia, genetic sequencing of the poliovirus isolated from a child paralyzed in Kazakhstan on 12 August 2010 has confirmed ongoing circulation of the virus which caused the Tajikistan outbreak and subsequently spread to the Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and possibly Uzbekistan. In the Russian Federation, the detection of an additional case of polio with onset on 25 September in the Republic of Dagestan confirms ongoing poliovirus transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region. In Tajikistan, the epicenter of the Central Asian outbreak (458 WPV1 cases, at 3 November), no new polio cases have been reported since 4 July 2010 following five mass immunization campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), with a sixth and final round planned for 8-12 November. In Turkmenistan (three WPV1 cases), no new cases have been reported since 28 June 2010, and four mass OPV immunization campaigns have been completed. In Kazakhstan, the seven-year-old boy from Saryagach in the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast (SKO) who was paralyzed on 12 August 2010, represents the only case in the country; a second large- scale OPV mop-up round is being conducted in the first week of November. The Russian Federation's 14th case, the child paralyzed on 25 September, brings the total number of cases in the North Caucasus Federal Region to six, three each from Dagestan and Chechnya. Genetic sequencing of this virus is consistent with ongoing transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region since the detection of the index cases on 15 July 2010 in Dagestan and 4 August 2010 in Chechnya following two separate importations from Tajikistan. The other eight cases in Russia represent sporadic importations associated with individual cases, the last of which occurred on 2 July 2010; none of these cases has been associated with ongoing circulation following local catch-up immunization activities with OPV. In response to the continued transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region, the Russian Federation initiated a 1st round of mass OPV immunization in the area on 1 November, with a 2nd round planned for late November; both rounds will target all children aged six months to 15 years. Although Uzbekistan has not confirmed a polio case during the current outbreak in Central Asia, it is not possible to rule out ongoing, undetected transmission in the country because stool samples from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases are not currently being tested in a WHO-accredited laboratory; the bordering areas of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan have all reported cases; and, at least one Uzbek national became paralyzed shortly after arrival in Russia which, given the incubation period for paralytic poliomyelitis, suggests infection may have occurred prior to leaving Uzbekistan. Recognizing the risk of a poliovirus importation and outbreak, Uzbekistan has conducted 4 nationwide OPV campaigns, the last one from 25-31 October. Countries at risk of poliovirus importation from Central Asia or the North Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation should continue to strengthen surveillance for AFP cases, ensure processing of all specimens at a WHO-accredited poliovirus laboratory, maintain high routine immunization coverage against polio, and conduct supplementary OPV immunization activities as needed to close gaps in population immunity. As per recommendations in the WHO's International Travel and Health guidelines, travelers to and from polio-affected countries should be fully protected by vaccination. Travelers who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to a polio-infected area should have a complete course of polio vaccination. Travelers from polio- affected areas should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure.

Travelers who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to a polio-infected area should have a complete course of polio vaccination. Travelers from polio- affected areas should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure.

"("" 13 November 2010 - The risk of further international spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in Central Asia and the North Caucasus Federal Region in Russia continues to be high. In Central Asia, genetic sequencing of the poliovirus isolated from a child paralyzed in Kazakhstan on 12 August 2010 has confirmed ongoing circulation of the virus which caused the Tajikistan outbreak and subsequently spread to the Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and possibly Uzbekistan. In the Russian Federation, the detection of an additional case of polio with onset on 25 September in the Republic of Dagestan confirms ongoing poliovirus transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region. In Tajikistan, the epicenter of the Central Asian outbreak (458 WPV1 cases, at 3 November), no new polio cases have been reported since 4 July 2010 following five mass immunization campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), with a sixth and final round planned for 8-12 November. In Turkmenistan (three WPV1 cases), no new cases have been reported since 28 June 2010, and four mass OPV immunization campaigns have been completed. In Kazakhstan, the seven-year-old boy from Saryagach in the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast (SKO) who was paralyzed on 12 August 2010, represents the only case in the country; a second large- scale OPV mop-up round is being conducted in the first week of November. The Russian Federation's 14th case, the child paralyzed on 25 September, brings the total number of cases in the North Caucasus Federal Region to six, three each from Dagestan and Chechnya. Genetic sequencing of this virus is consistent with ongoing transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region since the detection of the index cases on 15 July 2010 in Dagestan and 4 August 2010 in Chechnya following two separate importations from Tajikistan. The other eight cases in Russia represent sporadic importations associated with individual cases, the last of which occurred on 2 July 2010; none of these cases has been associated with ongoing circulation following local catch-up immunization activities with OPV. In response to the continued transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region, the Russian Federation initiated a 1st round of mass OPV immunization in the area on 1 November, with a 2nd round planned for late November; both rounds will target all children aged six months to 15 years. Although Uzbekistan has not confirmed a polio case during the current outbreak in Central Asia, it is not possible to rule out ongoing, undetected transmission in the country because stool samples from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases are not currently being tested in a WHO-accredited laboratory; the bordering areas of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan have all reported cases; and, at least one Uzbek national became paralyzed shortly after arrival in Russia which, given the incubation period for paralytic poliomyelitis, suggests infection may have occurred prior to leaving Uzbekistan. Recognizing the risk of a poliovirus importation and outbreak, Uzbekistan has conducted 4 nationwide OPV campaigns, the last one from 25-31 October. Countries at risk of poliovirus importation from Central Asia or the North Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation should continue to strengthen surveillance for AFP cases, ensure processing of all specimens at a WHO-accredited poliovirus laboratory, maintain high routine immunization coverage against polio, and conduct supplementary OPV immunization activities as needed to close gaps in population immunity.

"(' 17 November 2010 - On 16 November, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) reported that as of 14 November, 17 418 cumulative number of hospitalized admissions and 1 065 deaths were reported from seven Departments in the country. The departments reporting cases include Artibonite, Centre, Nord, Nord-Ouest, Nord Est, Ouest, and Sud. In metropolitan Port-au-Prince, communes reporting increases in cases include Carrefour, Cite Soleil, Delmas, Kenscoff, Petion Ville, and Tabarre. The rise in the number of cases in Cite Soleil is particularly concerning, due to its crowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and lack of access to potable water. On 16 November, Dominican Republic registered its first case of cholera in a 32-year-old male returning from Haiti. #### PAHO/WHO Response The Government of Haiti has established an emergency response centre at the National Palace to better coordinate a national response to the cholera outbreak. The centre is represented by key ministries, including Communications, Health, and Finance, Haiti’s water and sanitation authority DINEPA (Direction Nationale d\'Eau Potable et Assainissement), and representatives of UN agencies and bilateral organizations. The goal is to streamline activities and information for a multi-sectoral response. PAHO/WHO and health partners , including GOARN (Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) continue to support the Haitian MSPP, in the establishment of cholera treatment centres (CTC), cholera treatment units at hospital level (CTU) to triage and transfer severe patients to CTC, and strengthening of primary health care units to provide oral rehydration to less severe cases. Trainings are being provided to hospital staff and health workers on clinical management, management of dead bodies and public awareness and social mobilization activities. Supplies distributed to health facilities and health partners include medical supplies for responding to the outbreak, diarrhoea treatment kits, water purification tablets, bags of ringer\'s lactate, oral rehydration salt, intravenous fluids, catheters, granulated chlorine and water-sanitation logistic kits which include buckets, aspersion pumps, gloves and other supplies. PAHO/WHO is also working with the Dominican Republic\'s Ministry of Health in preparing for cholera response. A team of experts in case management, epidemiology, laboratory/microbiology and risk communications are working with national counterparts in a number of areas, including revising and updating standard operating procedures for surveillance, case investigation, detection, diagnosis and treatment; on risk communications; on enhancing the country\'s capacity to ensure access to safe drinking water and proper waste disposal. #### Recommendation WHO does not recommend restrictions to international travel or trade due to the cholera outbreak in Haiti.

"(' 24 November 2010 -- As of 20 November 2010, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) reported 60 240 cumulative cholera cases including 1 415 deaths at the national level. The case fatality rate in hospitals at the national level is 2.3%, with 67% of the deaths occurring at health services level and 33% at community level. In Port-au-prince and metropolitan area (Carrefour, Cite Soleil, Delmas, Kenscoff, Petion Ville, Tabarre and Croix des Bouquets), 5 778 cases, including 95 deaths have been reported. On 19 November, the Ministry of Health of the Dominican Republic reported two cases tested positive for cholera. One person is hospitalized and the other is receiving treatment at his residence in the province of Santo Domingo. WHO/PAHO and partners, including the GOARN (Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) continue to support the Haitian MSPP in the response to the outbreak. Civil unrest since 15 November has slowed down several activities, including delivery of supplies for prevention and treatment of patients, particularly in the Northern city of Cap Haitian. Trainings on cholera treatment and initiatives to chlorinate water for 300 000 people had to be postponed. The National Cholera Response Plan identifies the need to urgently scale-up Oral Rehydration Centres at the community level to provide services to non- life threatening cases and serve as a contact point for referring non severe patients to Cholera Treatment Units (CTUs) and severe patients to Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs). The plan states the essential need to scale-up CTUs, which are attached to or near existing health centres, to provide essential treatment and triage patients with severe symptoms to CTCs. Nationwide, CTCs with a total capacity of 2 830 beds have been established in Haiti. #### Recommendation WHO does not recommend restrictions to international travel or trade due to the cholera outbreak in Haiti.

"(' 27 May 2011 - An outbreak of severe illness is causing concern in Germany, where 3 women have died and 276 cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) have been reported since the second week of May. HUS, which can lead to kidney failure, is a complication of an infection by particular Escherichia coli bacteria. While most E.coli bacteria are harmless, a group called enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) can produce toxins, known as Shiga toxins or verotoxins, which damage blood cells and the kidneys. EHEC bacteria that produce these toxins are known as Shigatoxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or verocytotoxin-producing E.coli (VTEC), respectively. Many people have been hospitalized, several requiring intensive care, and new cases continue to be identified, the latest having an onset of 25 May. Some other countries have reported cases, notably Sweden, which has reported ten HUS cases, with two in intensive care. All the people affected recently visited Germany, mostly northern Germany. The outbreak is unusual in that it has developed very rapidly, and an unusually high number of cases affect adults (86% are in people aged 18 years or older), particularly women (67%), instead of the normal high-risk groups, which are young children and the elderly. Nevertheless, cases have also been reported in school-aged children. The unusual E. coli serogroup O104 is suspected of being the pathogen likely to be associated with this outbreak. The epidemiological investigation into the source of the outbreak is under way. Although the source has not yet been determined, cucumbers are under suspicion, and the Robert Koch Institute in Germany is advising people, as a precautionary measure, to avoid eating tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuces, in addition to taking the usual hygiene measures in handling fruit and vegetables. Germany notified WHO of the outbreak, under the International Health Regulations (IHR), as a potential public health event of international concern, and WHO is sharing information with health authorities in other countries. WHO has also offered technical assistance and stands ready to facilitate collaboration between laboratories to assist countries without the capacity to detect the unusual E. coli serogroup O104. WHO will maintain close contact with the relevant authorities. EHEC can cause bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain. People who develop these symptoms who are in or have recently visited Germany, particularly northern Germany, should seek medical advice urgently. The complication of HUS can cause acute kidney failure and can develop after the diarrhoea has resolved. Treatment with anti-diarrhoeal products or antibiotics is not usually recommended, as these may worsen the situation. Regular hand washing, particularly before food preparation or consumption and after toilet contact, is highly recommended, particularly for people who care for small children or are immunocompromised, as the bacterium can be passed from person to person, as well as through food, water and direct contact with animals. WHO does not recommend any restrictions in travel to or trade with Germany. ### Useful information Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a life-threatening disease characterized by acute renal failure (uraemia), haemolytic anaemia, and a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). It predominantly but not exclusively affects children. It results from EHEC infection, and it is estimated that up to 10% of EHEC- affected patients may develop HUS, with a mortality rate ranging up to 5%. Overall, HUS is the most common cause of acute renal failure in young children. It can cause neurological complications (such as seizure, stroke and coma) in 25% of HUS patients and chronic renal sequelae, usually mild, in around 50% of survivors. Shigatoxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a severe strain of E. coli bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of animals, mainly ruminants. EHEC produces toxins, known as verotoxins or Shiga- like toxins because of their similarity to the toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae. They can cause severe foodborne disease. STEC is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products and raw milk, contaminated water, direct contact with animals or contact with infected people. It is destroyed by thorough cooking of foods until all parts reach a temperature of 70 °C or higher. Symptoms of disease include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea, which may be bloody. Fever and vomiting may also occur. Most patients recover within 10 days, although in a few cases (particularly in young children and the elderly), the infection may lead to a life-threatening disease, such as HUS. Preventive measures for STEC infections are similar to those recommended for other foodborne diseases, including basic good food hygiene practice, as described in the WHO Five keys to safer food. #### For more information ',)",276

"("" 7 July 2011 - Pakistan has reported wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) isolated from a 16-month old child with onset of paralysis on 9 June 2011, from a conflict-affected, inaccessible area of Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). This is the only case of WPV3 detected in Asia in 2011. WPV3 transmission in Asia is on the verge of elimination, with the last case occurring more than six months ago, on 18 November 2010 (also from Khyber Agency, FATA). Confirmation of continuation of WPV3 transmission in tribal areas of Pakistan has significant implications for the global effort to eradicate WPV3, particularly as Asia is on the verge of eliminating circulation of this strain. The detection of WPV3 in Pakistan represents the risk that it may spread from this transmission focus to other WPV3-free areas of Asia and beyond. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at historically low levels in 2011, with other circulation of this strain restricted to parts of west Africa (17 cases in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali and Niger), Nigeria (five cases) and Chad (three cases). The risk of onward spread of WPV3 is deemed as high by the World Health Organization (WHO), particularly given large-scale population movements within Pakistan, between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and expected large-scale population movements associated with Umrah and the upcoming Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) in the coming few months. In 2011, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Pakistan have been inadequate in quality in key high-risk areas and a significant proportion of children remained inaccessible in conflict affected tribal areas. In FATA, particularly in Khyber agency, nearly 50% of children have been regularly missed during SIAs for the last two years. In addition to challenges relating to reaching children in insecure areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA, significant operational challenges continue to mar the quality of SIAs in accessible areas of Khyber and in other key transmission areas of the country, notably in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. In addition to confirmation of the only WPV3 case in Asia in 2011, Pakistan is affected by country-wide geographical transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), with 57 confirmed WPV1 cases in 2011 (as at 5 July 2011), compared with 14 WPV1 cases for the same period in 2010. To urgently address the situation, the Government of Pakistan has this year launched a National Polio Emergency Action Plan, under the auspices of His Excellency the President. However, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), set up at the request of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2010 to independently monitor progress towards a polio-free world, in April 2011 expressed alarm that the Plan is taking too long to implement, a conclusion echoed by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of the Eastern Mediterranean in June 2011. To rapidly build up immunity to both wild poliovirus strains, a Short Interval Additional Dose Strategy (SIAD) SIA with bivalent OPV is being conducted in Khyber Agency , the first passage on 4 July and the second on 12 July. It is expected that, as during the most recent SIAs in mid-June, 45% (89,449) of target children in Khyber Agency (80% in Bara Tehsil, i.e. approximately 73,000) will remain inaccessible during the SIADs. National Immunization Days (NIDs) will be conducted in the country on 18-20 July, using bivalent OPV (containing type 1 & 3 serotypes). However, key to success will be to overcome remaining operational challenges in fully-accessible areas and to implement special outreach strategies with full community participation to increase access to populations in security-compromised areas. To minimise the risk of WPV3 re-infecting Afghanistan, Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) - including in border areas with Pakistan - will be conducted in the country on 10-12 July, also using bivalent OPV. It is important that countries across Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response should importation occur. Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against all strains of polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Pakistan should be fully protected by vaccination. Travellers to Pakistan who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to Pakistan should complete a full course of vaccination. Travellers from Pakistan should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving Pakistan, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure. Some polio-free countries may also require travellers from Pakistan to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa. With Hajj and Umrah season already started, and Umrah expected to increase during Ramadan (in August) and Hajj in early November, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has vaccination requirements for travellers (all ages) for Umrah and Hajj. These requirements are in line with recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, with the addition that travellers of all ages from polio endemic countries are required to show proof of vaccination with OPV six weeks before travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and will receive a further dose of OPV upon their arrival. #### For more information "",)",1
"(' 22 July 2011 - Cholera outbreaks are being reported along the Congo River, affecting the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Congo. In DRC, the outbreak was reported in March 2011 and has intensified in the last 3 to 4 weeks, affecting four provinces (Bandundu, Equateur, Kinshasa and P Orientale). As of 20 July 2011, a total of 3 896 cases, including 265 deaths have been reported, with an overall case fatality of 7%. In the Republic of Congo, between 14 June and 20 July 2011, a total of 181 suspected cases including 6 deaths have been reported from four provinces (Brazzaville, Cuvette, Likouala and Plateaux) with a case fatality of 3%. Four cases from Brazzaville and Likouala have been laboratory confirmed with cholera. There is high risk of the epidemic further spreading along the Congo River. The outbreak has been reported to have spread to new locations, particularly in Kinshasa, where there are large population groups with inadequate safe water. In response to the outbreaks, the governments of DRC and the Republic of Congo, international organizations and non-government organizations have intensified surveillance, case management and health promotion activities in the affected areas, in addition to setting up cholera treatment centres at selected sites. In DRC, WHO is conducting a rapid risk assessment to identify urgent needs for the coming weeks.

"("" 20 September 2011 - Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) genetically linked to virus currently circulating in Pakistan has been isolated in China. Pakistan is affected by nationwide transmission of WPV1, and is the location of the only wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) case in Asia in 2011 (a strain on the verge of elimination on the continent). As at 13 September 2011, Pakistan had reported 84 cases, compared to 48 cases for the same period in 2010. In 2011, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Pakistan have been inadequate in quality in key high-risk areas. In security-compromised parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and in particular in Khyber agency, upwards of 200,000 children have been regularly missed during SIAs conducted during the last two years. In addition to challenges relating to reaching children in insecure areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA, significant operational challenges continue to mar the quality of SIAs in accessible areas of Khyber and in other key transmission areas of the country, notably in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. At the same time, undetected circulation cannot be ruled out due to persistent subnational surveillance gaps. Given these factors, the widespread transmission of WPV1, documented spread internationally, and the detection of the only WPV3 in Asia in 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) rates as 'high' the risk of further international spread of WPV from Pakistan, particularly given the expected large-scale population movements associated with Umrah and the upcoming Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) in the coming months. To urgently address the widespread transmission of wild poliovirus affecting the country, the Government of Pakistan has this year launched a National Polio Emergency Action Plan, under the auspices His Excellency the President. However, the impact of the Plan is not yet being seen at the critical programme implementation level. To rapidly build up population immunity levels to both serotypes, staggered subnational immunization days are planned for 19-21 September, to be closely followed by further activities in high-risk union councils in 54 districts of the country. However, key to success will be to overcome remaining operational challenges in fully-accessible areas and implemented special outreach strategies with full community participation to increase access to populations in security-compromised areas. To achieve this, full and consistent engagement and accountability at provincial, district and union-council level is urgently needed. It is important that countries across Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response should importation occur.

"(' 7 OCTOBER 2011 - In 2011 several large measles outbreaks have been reported from Member States in the European and African regions, with several reported outbreaks in the Americas linked to Europe or Africa. Europe: As of 20 September 2011, 40 of 53 Member States in the WHO European Region have reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases for the period January – July 2011 to the WHO European Regional Office through routine surveillance and outbreak reports. The highest number of cases was reported from France with 14 025 cases for the first six months of the year. In addition, eleven of all cases in the Region were lethal (6 in France and one in each of Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The predominant genotype currently circulating in the European Region is D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The most recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September, with 12 cases. Member States have responded to the outbreak by modifying the vaccination schedule, like France, or by offering vaccination free of charge or in schools, to increase accessibility to and availability of vaccines. Africa: The Regional Office reports that as of September 2011 large measles outbreaks are being reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with over 103 000 cases, Nigeria, with 17 428 cases, and Zambia, with 5 397 cases, and Ethiopia, with 2 902 cases. Even though deaths are not routinely reported to the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reports over 1100 measles-associated deaths in the country during 2011. Americas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the region in 2002. In 2011 the Region has received reports of several outbreaks linked to importation of measles virus from other regions. The largest, in Quebec, Canada, involves 742 reported cases, 89 requiring hospitalization, but no measles-associated deaths. Other outbreaks have been reported from the United States (213 cases), Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Columbia (7 cases), Mexico (3 cases), and Chile (6 cases). Most of these outbreaks are linked to importations from Europe, except for outbreaks in the United States and Chile linked to cases from Malaysia and the outbreak in Ecuador, linked to Kenya. Measles is a highly infectious disease that causes complications and deaths, even in previously-healthy individuals, but is fully preventable by vaccination. Countries need to ensure that they reach 95% coverage with two doses of measles vaccine across all age groups up to 15 years of age. Otherwise the country will experience measles outbreaks with large numbers of cases, associated hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in countries with high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles exportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region of the Americas or certain African countries. These exportations can lead to large outbreaks and associated deaths. These outbreaks should remind travellers that they should ensure that they have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine before their trip. ',)",103000

This final review added an additional two cases between April to 5 July 2012, making the total number of children affected to be 59. Of these, 52 have died. The age of the cases range from three months to 11 years old, with the majority being under three years old. The overall male: female ratio is 1.3:1. Laboratory samples were not available for the majority of the cases as they died before appropriate samples could be taken. Based on the latest laboratory results, a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The EV-71 virus has been known to generally cause severe complications amongst some patients. Additionally, a number of other pathogens, including dengue and streptococcus suis were identified in some of the samples. The samples were found to be negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses, SARS and Nipah. Further investigations into matching the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological information are ongoing, and are likely to be concluded in a few days. WHO and partners, which include lnstitut Pasteur du Cambodge and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are assisting the Ministry of Health with this event. The Government is also reinforcing awareness of good hygiene practices to the public, which includes frequent washing of hands. #### Some facts on hand foot and mouth disease: Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been associated with serious complications in certain groups, and may cause deaths. HFMD mainly occurs amongst children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or two days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms, or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease. HFMD virus is contagious and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the first week of the illness but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease. Presently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD. Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms. Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids. ',)",59
"(' 13 July 2012 - The investigation into the illnesses and deaths in Cambodia, which mainly affected very young children, concluded that a severe form of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) was the cause in the majority of cases reported to the Ministry of Health. Samples from a total of 31 patients were obtained and tested for a number of pathogens by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. Most of these samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71) which causes HFMD. A small proportion of samples also tested positive for other pathogens including Haemophilus Influenzae type B and Streptococcus suis. It was not possible to test all the patients as some of them died before appropriate samples could be taken. The investigation included: * a thorough review of the hospital records of the patients from Kantha Bhopa hospital as well as from other hospitals; * laboratory tests; * active follow-up with the affected families by the local Rapid Response Teams (RRT); and * evaluation of the data from the national surveillance system. A total of 78 cases were identified. These included the initial 62 cases reported by Kantha Bopha hospital, and cases reported from other hospitals. Of these, the investigation focused on 61 cases that fitted a specific criteria (the case definition), and of which 54 had died. The investigation revealed that most of the cases were under 3 years of age, from 14 different provinces, with some suffering from chronic conditions. A significant number of cases had been treated with steroids at some point during their illness. Steroid use has been shown to worsen the condition of patients with EV-71. The Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, which included Institut Pasteur du Cambodge and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conducted the investigation following reports from Kantha Bopha Children’s hospital of unusual numbers of illness and deaths among children hospitalised since April 2012. In response to this event, health centers have been instructed by the Ministry of Health to report all patients with HFMD. In addition, the Ministry of Health, assisted by WHO, has begun enhanced surveillance for neuro-respiratory syndrome, a key syndrome observed among patients with severe HFMD caused by EV-71. It is expected that the enhanced surveillance will identify occasional new cases of the severe form of the disease in the coming months. In addition, the Ministry of Health is developing guidelines and training courses for staff to manage patients with mild and severe forms of HFMD. A campaign to raise awareness on the prevention, identification and care of children with HFMD is underway. ',)",78

"(' 3 September 2012 - There have been no new confirmed cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever reported in Kibaale district, Uganda, since 3 August 2012, indicating that the outbreak is coming to an end. A total of 24 probable and confirmed cases including 17 deaths have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak. Of these, 11 cases were laboratory confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe. The last confirmed case was discharged on 24 August 2012 following recovery. All contacts of probable and confirmed cases have been followed up daily and have completed the recommended 21 days of monitoring for any possible signs or symptoms of Ebola. The partners who are involved in the response to the Ebola outbreak are transferring capacity to national and district authorities to sustain the essential functions, including enhanced surveillance and response, psychosocial support and infection prevention and control in health care facilities. The Ebola isolation facilities in Kibaale District Hospital and at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala remain on stand-by for receiving any suspected cases. The ecological studies team in Kibaale district has collected samples from bats, primates and livestock to study the possible natural history of Ebola virus and putative initial human infection from wildlife. ### Neighbouring countries At the time of this update, an Ebola outbreak is on-going in the Province Orientale of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These two Ebola outbreaks are not epidemiologically linked and have been caused by two different Ebola subtypes; (Uganda: Ebola subtype Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo Ebola subtype Bundibugyo). With respect to this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions are applied to Uganda. ### General information on Ebola subtypes: There are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location they have been first detected in Ebola outbreaks. Three subtypes of the five have been associated with large Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in Africa: Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan and Ebola- Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25-90% of all cases. The Ebola Reston species, found in the Philippines, can infect humans, but no illness or death in humans has been reported to date. ',)",24
"(' 4 September 2012 - As of 31 August 2012, the National Park Service Office of Public Health (NPS) has reported six cases of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) among visitors to Yosemite National Park in California, United States of America. Two of the six cases died. Investigations carried out by the NPS revealed that the six cases contracted the disease in June and July of this year. Five of these six cases stayed in the same “Signature Tent Cabins” in the Curry Village area of the park. NPS is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health to detect additional cases and to heighten public health awareness of Hantavirus and HPS, in order to rapidly identify potential new cases and provide treatment early. HPS is a rare but serious disease and is caused by a virus that individuals get through contact with the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. The deer mouse is the primary host of the virus. The disease begins with fever, chills, muscle aches, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, but can progress rapidly to life-threatening illness. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms can appear as early as one week and as late as six weeks following exposure. Person-to-person transmission of Hantavirus has not been reported in the United States of America. There is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for Hantavirus infection. Early recognition and treatment of infected individuals can reduce disease progression. The park authorities are undertaking all measures including intensified building inspections, cleanings throughout the park, monitoring of the rodents population, as well as distribution of Hantavirus information to every visitor and throughout the park. The “Signature Tent Cabins” are now closed. Travellers are advised to avoid exposure to rodents and their excreta. Adventure travellers, backpackers, campers and travellers with occupational exposure to rodents in countries or areas at risk for Hantaviruses should take precautions to exclude rodents from tents or other accommodation and to protect all food from contamination by rodents. An extensive national and international outreach effort is underway by Yosemite National Park and the park concessioner to contact visitors who stayed in the ""Signature Tent Cabins"" at Yosemite\'s Curry Village since mid- June. The NPS is asking individuals who stayed in ""Signature Series Cabins"" (which are numbered in the 900s) between 10 June 2012 and 24 August 2012 to seek immediate medical attention if they exhibit any symptoms of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). A non-emergency phone line has been set up by NPS for questions and concerns related to Hantavirus in Yosemite +1 209 372-0822.

As of 5 September 2012, a total of 16 360 cases including 255 deaths with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.6% have been reported from 12 out of 13 districts. The western area of the country where the capital city of Freetown is located, reported more than 60% of all new cases. The President of Sierra Leone has declared the cholera epidemic a ""humanitarian crisis"". A high level Presidential Cholera Task Force was established to oversee coordination, mobilization of resources and guide the response. A multi-sectoral approach to the response has been adopted involving the MOHS and other line ministries such as Finance, Information and Communication, and local governments together with partners and stakeholders. With support from national and international partners and donors, including UNICEF, Oxfam, British Red Cross, Save the Children, Care, Concern MSF, DFID, OCHA, IRC, and WHO, the MOHS is scaling up the response particularly in the areas of coordination of the overall response, surveillance and case management. A Cholera Control and Command Center (C4) has been established at the WHO Country Office in Freetown to strengthen coordination, and support the MOHS and other health providers to implement activities related to the Cholera Preparedness and Response Operation Plan (CPROP), in order to bring the epidemic under control as soon as possible. The C4 will also provide information to guide the decision-making of the national task force. Emphasis is being placed on early detection of cases and timely provision of treatment at the district levels in order to reduce deaths. Cholera cases are managed in cholera treatment units (CTUs) and where there are no established CTUs, emphasis is placed on designating specific areas within the health facilities for isolation purposes. WHO through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has provided experienced case management and laboratory experts from the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) to build capacity among health-care workers and laboratory technicians in case management and laboratory diagnosis. Laboratories at the national level are being supplied with appropriate materials and reagents to collect, transport and analyze laboratory specimens. Laboratory confirmation is important, particularly in new areas experiencing the cholera outbreak. There are ongoing community interventions on cholera prevention and control activities. More than 200 traditional healers have been oriented on cholera. Community meetings are organized in Freetown to raise awareness of the importance of avoiding drinking water from unprotected water sources. Text messages are also being used to channel information to the public by telephone companies. UNICEF and other partners are supporting water, sanitation and hygiene activities.

"(' 25 September 2012 - As of 25 September 2012, no additional cases of acute respiratory syndrome with renal failure due to infection with a novel coronavirus have been reported to WHO. WHO is continuing investigations into two recently confirmed infections identified as a novel coronavirus. Today WHO issued an interim case definition to help countries strengthen health protection measures against the new virus. The case definition, based on the cases so far, includes criteria for identifying a ‘patient under investigation’, a ‘probable case’ and a ‘confirmed case’. These criteria are based on clinical, epidemiological and laboratory indicators. Following the confirmation of the novel coronavirus, WHO - under the International Health Regulations - immediately alerted all its Member States about the virus and has been leading the coordination and providing guidance to health authorities and technical health agencies. WHO is also identifying a network of laboratories that can provide expertise on coronaviruses for countries. On 22 September 2012, the United Kingdom (UK) informed WHO of a case of acute respiratory syndrome with travel history to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The case is a previously healthy, 49 year-old male Qatari national that presented with symptoms on 3 September 2012 with travel history to Saudi Arabia several days prior to onset of illness. On 7 September he was admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha, Qatar. On 11 September, he was transferred to the UK by air ambulance from Qatar. The Health Protection Agency of the UK (HPA) conducted laboratory testing and subsequently confirmed the presence of the novel coronavirus. The HPA compared information from the clinical sample collected from the 49 year-old Qatari national with that of a virus sequenced previously by the Erasmus University Medical Centre, Netherlands. This latter isolate was obtained from lung tissue of a fatal case earlier this year in a 60 year-old Saudi national. This comparison indicated 99.5% identity, with one nucleotide mismatch over the regions compared.* Though it is a very different virus to SARS, given the severity of the two confirmed cases so far, WHO is engaged in further characterizing the novel coronavirus. As such, international efforts are being stepped up across all WHO six regions to ensure an appropriate and effective response with a WHO specialist team in daily contact with more than a dozen international and regional technical partners. In addition WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia, as in previous years, to support the country’s health measures for all visitors participating in the Haji pilgrimage to Mecca next month. * * * * Please note the change as an earlier version stated that sequencing of the virus isolate from the 49 year old had been compared by HPA.

The cases all presented with fever, cough and other ILI symptoms. Four of the cases died, with 1 case, the 8 month old male, recovering after only experiencing mild ILI. Laboratory samples were tested by the National Institute of Public Health's laboratory and by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. Preliminary evidence does not support human-to-human transmission and four of the cases are known to have had close contact with sick/dead poultry. The Ministry of Health's Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have gone to the hospitals and the field to identify the patients’ close contacts, any epidemiological linkage among the five cases and initiate preventive treatment as required. In addition, public health education campaigns are being conducted in the villages to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The teams are checking records for evidence of increased ILI activity in the local health centres or any increase in number of SARI cases from the affected areas. Results from testing of those who have ILI symptoms among close contacts for A/H5N1 influenza to date were negative. There is enhanced surveillance for ILI and SARI in local health centre and hospital for a further two weeks. Health education messages have been distributed to the community. The World Health Organization is actively assisting the Ministry of Health in their investigations. "",)",5

"(' 3 June 2013 - In Israel, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was isolated from sewage samples collected on 9 April 2013 in Rahat, southern Israel. The virus has been detected in sewage only; no case of paralytic polio has been reported. Genetic sequencing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine its origin. Preliminary analyses indicate the strain is not related to the virus currently affecting the Horn of Africa. The virus isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance in Israel that involves regular testing of sewage water. Israel has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1988. In the past, wild poliovirus has been detected in environmental samples collected in this region between 1991 and 2002 without occurrence of cases of paralytic polio in the area. Following detection of the wild poliovirus, health authorities in Israel are conducting a full epidemiological and public health investigation, actively searching for potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un- immunized persons. Routine immunization levels are estimated at 94 percent. Outcomes of the investigation will determine the need for any additional catch-up immunization activities, as necessary. Similar activities are being implemented by health authorities in Gaza and the West Bank. Specimens collected through environmental surveillance since 2002 in both Gaza and the West Bank have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV. Given that there are high levels of population immunity levels in the area, and the investigations and response being implemented, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus strain from Israel as low to moderate. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 percent. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Three countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of WPV: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Additionally, in 2013, the Horn of Africa is affected by an outbreak of WPV, with six cases confirmed in Kenya and Somalia. ',)",0
"(' 15 July 2013 - Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been isolated in 30 sewage samples from 10 sampling sites in Israel. The samples were collected from 3 February 2013 to 30 June 2013. Most positive WPV1 samples were detected from southern Israel. All viruses have been detected in sewage only; no cases of paralytic polio have been reported. Detection of viruses across the country indicates increased geographic extent of circulation for a prolonged period of time. WHO assesses the risk of further international spread of WPV from Israel as moderate to high. Health authorities in Israel are continuing to conduct a full epidemiological and public health investigation to actively search for potential cases of paralytic polio and any un-immunized persons. Routine immunization coverage is estimated at 94 percent or above over last eight years. The frequency of environmental surveillance sampling has been increased. Environmental surveillance is frequently used by countries around the world, including in Israel, to support the detection of diseases of public health importance. Similar activities are being implemented by health authorities in Gaza and West Bank and no WPV has been detected to date from these areas. The Government of Israel is planning supplementary immunization activities (SIA) with oral polio vaccine (OPV). The objectives of the SIAs with OPV are to boost mucosal immunity levels to rapidly interrupt virus circulation. These SIAs follow efforts initiated beginning of June 2013 to catch-up with any un or under immunized children using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

"(' 15 August 2013 - The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from Israel to remain moderate to high.

Initially restricted to southern Israel, WPV1 has now also been detected in the central district as well. WPV1 has also been isolated in stool samples from 27 healthy children (all under the age of nine years) and one adult, who had been fully immunized for their age as part of ongoing stool sample survey activities. No case of paralytic polio has been reported. In addition to routine acute flaccid paralysis, public health authorities have expanded the surveillance to all age groups and have increased enterovirus surveillance and are screening aseptic meningitis cases for polio. A supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) started in parts of southern Israel during the week of 5 August 2013, and a nationwide campaign is planned for 18 August 2013 for children up to the age of nine years. The objective of these SIAs with OPV is to boost mucosal immunity levels in cohorts of children naïve to OPV to rapidly interrupt virus circulation. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 percent. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from poliovirus-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: * strengthen surveillance and situation analysis; * reinforce case management and treatment; and * conduct risk communication with the public and release information; ### Sporadic human cases The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links'). While the recent report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas, especially given expected increases in the trade and transport of poultry associated with the Lunar New Year. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among human. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. ### WHO advice WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

"(' 17 March 2014 - In Cameroon, three additional wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported with onset of paralysis on 6, 25, and 31 January 2014 from three new regions (North West, Adamaoua, and Centre) confirming continued WPV transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of four cases in October 2013. In total, seven WPV1 cases have now been reported from West, North West, Centre and Adamaoua Regions, with onset of paralysis ranging from 1 October 2013 to 31 January 2014. Genetic sequencing of WPV1 isolates suggests prolonged undetected circulation of poliovirus. Due to continued poliovirus circulation in Cameroon, gaps in surveillance, and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic, WHO is elevating the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high. Following confirmation of the outbreak in October 2013, Cameroon conducted three nationwide immunization campaigns with a fourth nationwide activity starting on 9 March 2014. Even though independent monitoring suggests some improvements, serious gaps in quality remain (both in implementation and monitoring) which must be urgently addressed. Quality varies greatly by region. The main reason for non-vaccination of children is that houses had not been visited (43% of non-vaccinated children). Analysis of overall population immunity (non-polio acute flaccid paralysis data 6-59 months) suggests upwards of 40% of children remain under-immunized (with 30% having received zero doses of oral polio vaccine – OPV). The continuation and expanding spread of transmission indicates serious gaps in quality of outbreak response. The confirmation of new cases has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity in April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

"(' ## Ongoing transmission in the Syrian Arab Republic with international spread 21 March 2014 - Polio outbreak response in the Middle East is continuing to urgently stop an outbreak affecting the region. As of 20 March 2014, in the Syrian Arab Republic a total of 37 WPV1 cases have been reported: 25 cases by the Syrian Arab Republic Ministry of Health, and 12 cases from contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour) not yet reflected in official figures. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 17 December 2013, from Edleb. Further evidence of regional spread was confirmed this week by notification of a WPV1 case from Iraq, the first polio case in the country since 2000. The case, a six-month old boy from Baghdad who had not been immunized, developed paralysis on 10 February 2014. Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is most closely related to virus detected in the Syrian Arab Republic. WPV1 was also isolated from the child’s three-year old sister, who did not develop symptoms. Prospects for rapidly controlling this event are positive, as Iraq has been part of a regional Middle East emergency outbreak response since confirmation of polio in the Syrian Arab Republic was received in October 2013. In response, all countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, in a joint resolution, declared polio eradication to be an emergency, calling for support in negotiating and establishing access to those children who are currently unreached with polio vaccination. In Iraq, since October, two nationwide immunization campaigns and three subnational campaigns have been conducted, achieving overall high quality. Approximately 95% of children were reported to have been reached during each campaign, though coverage has varied by area. WHO and UNICEF estimates from 2012 put routine immunization levels in Iraq at 70%. Routine immunization levels in Baghdad are estimated to be 81%. As part of outbreak response, efforts have been ongoing to strengthen subnational surveillance sensitivity to ascertain the full extent of transmission, particularly in the Syrian Arab Republic. Subnational surveillance gaps persist, particularly in areas of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Lattakia, Quneitra and Al Raqa. Surveillance quality has improved in other governorates of north-eastern Syrian Arab Republic, including in Deir Al Zour. Phase 1 of the planned regional outbreak response is now being completed. Since October 2013, 24 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been conducted across the region to reach more than 22 million children with multiple doses, in: * Egypt (2 nationwide SIAs; 1 subnational SIA); * Iraq (2 nationwide SIAs; 3 subnational SIAs); * Jordan (3 nationwide SIAs); * Lebanon (3 nationwide SIAs); * Syria (5 nationwide SIAs); * Turkey (3 subnational SIAs); and * West Bank and Gaza Strip (2 SIAs). Phase 2 is being launched on 1 April 2014, with nationwide campaigns in: Egypt (1-3 April); Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq (both on 6-10 April) and Lebanon (April), to be followed by further campaigns across the region in May. In Israel, WPV1-positive samples continue to be detected through environmental surveillance. In total, 186 positive samples have been collected since 3 February 2013, the most recent of which on 16 February 2014. In West Bank and Gaza Strip 3 WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance, the most recent of which was detected in January 2014. No cases of polio paralysis have been detected in Israel, West Bank or Gaza Strip; WPV1 has been isolated from sewage samples only. A surveillance alert remains in place for the region, calling on countries to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended SIAs with OPV.

"(' 27 March 2014 - The Ministry of Health of Guinea has today reported 4 laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the capital, Conakry. In addition, a fifth suspected case died without laboratory confirmation. Intensive case investigations are underway to identify the source and route of these patients’ infection, record their travel histories before arrival in Conakry and determine their period of infectivity for the purposes of contact tracing. Rapid Response Teams are carrying out these investigations and sensitizing health care workers and the affected communities about EHF to reduce the risk of further transmission. The total number of suspected and confirmed cases in the on-going EHF outbreak in Guinea has increased to 103, including 66 deaths. Today 15 new suspected cases were reported in Guinea (8 in Guekedou and 2 in Macenta, in addition to the 5 cases in Conakry). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 64%. All age groups have been affected but most of the cases are adults aged 15-59 years. Four health care workers are among the deaths attributed to the Ebola outbreak. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths are preliminary and subject to change due to enhanced surveillance activities and laboratory testing of cases. Since the beginning of the outbreak, most of the cases have been reported in three districts in south east Guinea (Guekedou, Macenta, and Kissidougou districts). Contact tracing and follow up continues in these areas. To date, 15 cases have tested positive by PCR testing for the ebolavirus, confirmed by collaborating laboratories including the Institut Pasteur Lyon, France, Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar, Senegal and Bernhard-Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine Hamburg, Germany.

"(' 30 March 2014 - The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Liberia has provided updated details on the suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia. As of 29 March, seven clinical samples, all from adult patients from Foya district, Lofa County, have been tested by PCR using Ebola Zaire virus primers by the mobile laboratory of the Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar in Conakry. Two of those samples have tested positive for the ebolavirus. There have been 2 deaths among the suspected cases; a 35 year-old woman who died on 21 March tested positive for ebolavirus while a male patient who died on 27 March tested negative. Foya remains the only district in Liberia that has reported confirmed or suspected cases of EHF. As of 26 March, Liberia had 27 contacts under medical follow-up. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the MoH of Liberia is communicating regularly with WHO and neighbouring countries to help coordinate and harmonise surveillance, prevention and control activities. Response activities within health care facilities include strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) at the Foya Hospital, the provision of additional personal preventive equipment (PPE) and medical supplies to support case isolation and clinical management and training for health care workers in IPC. Health-care workers are receiving training on EHF; 50 clinicians from 5 hospitals in Montserrado County received training on 27 March. PPE and medical supplies have also been sent to Bong and Nimba Counties which border Guinea. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data. Liberia has established a high level National Task Force to lead the response. Response partners include WHO, the International Red Cross (IRC), Samaritan’s Purse (SP) Liberia, Pentecostal Mission Unlimited (PMU)-Liberia, CHF-WASH Liberia, PLAN-Liberia, UNFPA and UNICEF. The IRC is supporting awareness campaigns among health-care workers in a number of districts in Lofa County, and is working with PMU-Liberia and SP Liberia to provide PPE to 41 health facilities including 37 clinics, 3 health centres and the Curran Lutheran Hospital. Samaritan’s Purse is also providing logistics for the movement of response personnel medical supplies and fuel. CHF-WASH Liberia, PLAN-Liberia, UNFPA and UNICEF are supporting the MoH in social mobilisation activities to raise community awareness about EHF and promote risk reduction measures. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ',)",7

Therefore, this report provides an update on Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. As at 31 March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 122 clinically compatible cases of EVD, of which 24 are laboratory confirmed by PCR, and 98 are probable (78) or suspected (22) cases. This total number includes 80 deaths, of which 13 (16%) have been laboratory confirmed for EVD and the remaining 67 are considered as probable cases of EVD. These figures correspond to 19 new clinical cases and 14 new deaths since the 28 March. As of 30 March, 20 patients remain in isolation. Eleven health-care workers are among the probable and suspected cases. Cases have been reported from Conakry (11), Guekedou (77), Macenta (23), Kissidougou (8), and 3 from Dabola and Djingaraye combined. Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 400 contacts under medical follow-up at present. Further strengthening of infection prevention and control in health-care facilities is a priority intervention. In addition, efforts are continuing to raise awareness in the community about the importance of personal protective measures to prevent ebolavirus transmission including hand washing, caring for the sick safely in the community, the use of personal protective equipment when handling potentially contaminated blood and body fluids and during environmental cleaning and disinfection, and safe burials. The Ministry of Health of Liberia has reported 8 clinically compatible cases of EVD, including 2 laboratory-confirmed cases, from 14 to 30 March. The 2 confirmed cases were reported from Lofa County. Two patients died; one of the deceased patients has been laboratory confirmed and the other death was in a probable case. Contact tracing is underway. Response activities in Liberia include a press conference by the Ministries of Health & Social Welfare and Ministry of Information, distribution of EVD prevention and control guidelines to health-care workers, training staff on case detection, contact tracing and follow up, clinical case management, infection prevention and control, specimen collection, handling and transportation and the safe handling of deceased patients. Staff from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and WHO have travelled to Lofa County to provide technical support and coordinate control efforts. Clinical specimens from suspected cases are being sent to the laboratory in Conakry, Guinea, for testing. Intensive community awareness raising campaigns are also underway through the mass media, via social mobilization activities and interpersonal communications, and involvement of telephone service providers in sending text messages. The Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone is maintaining a high level of vigilance following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. To date, active surveillance activities have identified no new suspected cases and all contacts of the deceased have remained well. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since most human infections result from direct contact with the body fluids or secretions of infected patients, particularly in hospitals (nosocomial transmission) and as a result of unsafe procedures, use of contaminated medical devices (including needles and syringes) and unprotected exposure to contaminated body fluids. Travellers should avoid all contact with infected patients. Those who are providing medical care or are involved in the evaluation of an outbreak should wear protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection and practice proper infection prevention and control and measures. Anyone who has stayed in the areas where EVD cases have been recently reported should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness. Clinicians managing returning travellers from visiting these areas with compatible symptoms are advised to take into consideration the possibility of EVD. Malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers are differential diagnosis to consider in these patients.

The total number includes 86 deaths (CFR 60%). New cases have been reported from Conakry, Guekedou and Macenta; 23 patients are currently in isolation units. The date of onset of the most recent laboratory confirmed case is 3 April. The current number of clinical and confirmed cases and deaths by place of report is Conakry (18 cases, including 5 deaths), Guekedou (85 cases/59 deaths), Macenta (27 cases/14 deaths), Kissidougou (9 cases/5 deaths), and Dabola and Djingaraye combined (4 cases/3 deaths). Sixteen of the 18 clinical cases in Conakry have been laboratory confirmed for EVD. There has been no increase in the number of affected health-care workers (HCW) from the 14 reported previously, including 8 deaths; 11 of the affected HCWs are laboratory confirmed cases. Sixteen of the 86 deaths overall are laboratory confirmed, 65 are classified as probable cases and 5 as suspected cases. Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 623 contacts requiring medical follow-up; this includes 74 new contacts identified on 3 April while 49 have been released from observation as they have remained well after the maximum incubation period for EVD of 21 days following the last exposure to a case. Laboratory support for the investigation is being provided by Institut Pasteur Dakar, Senegal, and the mobile laboratory in Guekedou. Reference laboratory functions have been provided by Institut Pasteur Lyon, France, the Bernhard- Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine Hamburg, Germany, and the Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI) laboratory in Lyon, France. WHO, in collaboration with technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has deployed field laboratory support, and experts in anthropology, epidemiology, logistics, clinical case management and infection prevention and control and outbreak coordination to support the response in Guinea. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported 18 suspected and 2 confirmed cases of EBV, including 7 deaths, since 24 March (CFR 31%); 7 patients are currently in an isolation unit while 2 suspected cases have been discharged. Four new clinically compatible cases were reported on 4 April. One of the suspected cases is in a health care-worker. Both of the laboratory confirmed cases, sisters from Lofa County, have died. The suspected cases include a hunter treated at a hospital in Tapita, Nimba County, who died shortly after presenting to the health facility and a 3 year- old boy with a clinically compatible illness who had travelled from Guinea. The deceased hunter gave no history of contact with known cases in Liberia or Guinea and his exposure is being investigated to exclude transmission from an animal source (bush meat). The laboratory results for both of these suspected cases are pending. The MOHSW has placed 46 contacts under medical observation, including those of the second confirmed case who travelled from Foyah, Lofa Country, to Monrovia, Montserrado Country, and then to Firestone in Margibi County. A total of 21 clinical samples have been sent to Conakry, Guinea, for laboratory testing. Counties of concern for EVD in Liberia include Lofa, Bong, Nimba, Margibi and Montserrado. In response, Liberia has been scaling up activities to prevent the further spread of EVD. The National Task Force is conducting daily coordination meetings with response partners. WHO continues to provide technical expertise to the MOHSW, including public communications, providing a high level briefing on EVD prevention and control to the joint session of both houses of parliament and mobilising experts in epidemiology and infection prevention and control. The WHO Country Office in Liberia is working closely with the MOHSW to carry out needs assessments in areas such as procurement and the supply chain for critical materials and equipment need in the response to the outbreak. WHO is also working with the health information systems team at the MOHSW to further develop templates for case-based data collection and to track technical assistance. Additional deployments of regional experts, and partners in GOARN, are planned to support coordination activities, infection prevention and control, risk communications and social mobilisation. At the request of the MOHSW and WHO, the Metabiota Laboratory in Kenema, Sierra Leone, will install Real-Time Zaire ebolavirus-specific PCR, a pan-filo PCR, Lassa virus PCR, yellow fever and Marburg virus PCRs among other assays. This technology is being transferred from its laboratory in Kenema, Sierra Leone. Metabiota will also provide training to laboratory staff in Liberia. Medical supplies and equipment have been provided by WHO, UNHCR, MSF, Save the Children and other partners, including personal protective equipment for health care facilities. Seven isolation units have been established in 5 counties. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is conducting training for health- care workers in the affected counties on case management, including on setting up isolation facilities. An additional 60 HCWs have been trained in Margibi County. Community education and social mobilisation activities have been strongly supported by the media and telecommunications sectors in Liberia. Local government officials, community and religious leaders and traditional healers have been approached to support the MOHSW in prevention and control activities; however, additional resources are needed to expand surveillance and health promotion and social mobilisation activities to schools, religious gatherings, market places and work places. Plans are also underway to mobilise the public through house-to-house visits. The Ministry of Health of Mali has notified WHO of 4 patients suspected to have a viral haemorrhagic fever who presented for health care in Sibiribougou, Koulikoro Region of Mali. Two of the suspected cases had travelled from Guinea. The patients were placed in isolation pending epidemiological investigations and laboratory testing. Contact tracing is underway. Clinical samples have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, for testing. Epidemiological surveillance is being enhanced on the ground and Rapid Response Teams are being mobilised to identify and treat suspected cases should others present. An isolation unit has been prepared in Bamako and units are also being installed in other locations. Information hotlines are being made available to the public. There has been no change in the situation in Sierra Leone following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. The office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is coordinating all operations involving suspected cases of Ebola as well as the follow-up investigations. Enhanced surveillance and public education activities are continuing. Senior officials from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) have visited border crossings between Sierra Leone and Guinea to sensitise border authorities about current prevention and response plans and public health medical officers are visiting border communities to support social mobilisation activities. Metabiota Laboratory in Kenema working under the MOHS and with the WHO Country Office in Sierra Leone, has established a full suite of ebolavirus-specific assays and differential diagnostics for other important viral haemorrhagic fevers that are locally endemic. The full range of assays is described in the section of this report for Metabiota activities in Liberia. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to daily changes due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and ongoing laboratory investigations.

Response partners supporting the MOH include WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MSF, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the NIH and the UN Children's Rights and Emergency Relief Organization (UNICEF). ### Liberia As of 16 April the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a cumulative total of 27 clinical cases of EVD, including 13 deaths attributed to EVD. One new suspected case reported yesterday from Nimba County has been laboratory confirmed as a case of Lassa fever. Two patients remain hospitalised and 33 contacts remain under medical observation. The MOHSW commissioned a new ebolavirus laboratory on 16 April in collaboration with Metabiota. The MOHSW, in collaboration with WHO and the GOARN team in Liberia, has conducted visits to the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia and the Redemption Hospital, New Kru Town in Montserrado County, and conducted the first training in case management, triage and infection prevention and control. ### Sierra Leone On 15 April, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) provided a consolidated report of surveillance activities conducted in that country from 19 March onwards. A total of 12 suspected cases have been identified during that period. Two previously reported suspected EVD deaths occurred in individuals from one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone for burial. All of the 15 case contacts have completed 21 days of medical follow-up and have remained well. The Metabiota laboratory team working at the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Fever Isolation Unit have received and tested clinical samples from 11 of the suspected cases using 2 different real-time PCR protocols for Ebola Zaire, other viral haemorrhagic fevers and important locally endemic pathogens. All of the samples have tested negative for ebolavirus and the other pathogens included in the test panel. Follow up on rumours of EVD cases and active case finding is ongoing in Sierra Leone. Metabiota in collaboration with the MOHS have conducted training of trainers for 75 clinicians and nurses from the main referral government, private and mission hospitals in the 13 districts on EVD preparedness and response at the Kenema Lassa Fever unit. Multimedia community sensitisation activities are also continuing. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Mali or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. "",)",0

Twenty-one (21) patients were in isolation in Conakry (12), Guekedou (8) and Macenta (1), while 16 patients who recovered from their illness were discharged from hospital. Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. A total of 217 contacts are currently under medical observation and 92 have completed their 21 days of follow-up. The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries. ### Liberia From 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 21 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has reported a total of 34 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, 2 probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April and the date of admission of the last confirmed case was 10 April. The confirmed and probable cases were reported from Lofa and Margibi Counties, while suspected cases have been reported from Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado and Nimba Counties as a result of enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities. The number of confirmed cases in HCWs has been adjusted down from 3 cases to two as data are reviewed against case definitions and laboratory results. The total number of deaths has also been revised from 13 to 11 as one of the deaths has been counted in the EVD statistics for Guinea and one death occurred in a discarded case. As laboratory tests have been conducted on 32 clinical samples overall only 6 of which have tested positive for ebolavirus to date, it is anticipated that most of the suspected cases currently reported by Liberia will be reclassified as discarded and removed from the case count in the future. Following data review, the number of contacts now stands at 162 in total; Foya district, Lofa County, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia accounts for 72% (116) of the total contacts followed by Margibi County (17%, 28 contacts).

"("" 24 April 2014 - On 12 March 2014, 2 events of yellow fever were reported in the North and in the South of DRC. Six laboratory-confirmed cases with yellow fever virus infection were reported. Of these, 3 were from Bondo health zone1, Orientale Province, 2 from Buta health zone, Orientale Province and 1 from Kikondja health zone, Katanga Province. In total 139 suspected, probable and confirmed cases, including 6 deaths were reported. In Bondo district, the index case was a 40 year-old man who became ill with fever and jaundice on 10 December 2013. His yellow fever vaccination status is not known. Laboratory confirmation was conducted by the Institute National of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa, which showed IgM positive by ELISA test. Reconfirmation of the laboratory test was conducted by the regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal with a more specific test for yellow fever (plaque reduction neutralization test or PRNT), with exclusion of other arbovirus. The second case was reported in the same health zone on 30 January 2014 and laboratory-confirmation was conducted on 11 March 2014. The patient’s vaccination status for yellow fever is not known. Preliminary outbreak investigations revealed that in Bondo and the health district of Buta, at least 116 suspected cases were reported. In Kikondja district, the index case was a 19 year-old woman reported by the Health Center of Ntwadi on 17 February 2014. The case was laboratory-confirmed by INRB and IP Dakar. Following identification of the index case, an outbreak investigation was conducted in 3 villages, Katongue, Kimbuvu and Lukila, where 23 suspected cases were identified. International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG2), approved the provision of 559 876 doses of yellow fever vaccine and operational costs for a reactive mass vaccination campaign. A reactive mass vaccination campaign is being planned for 1 May 2014. The campaign will be headed by the Ministry of Health, DRC, with support from the GAVI Alliance, Médecin sans frontières (MSF) and other partners. WHO is closely supporting the management of the outbreak in monitoring, preventive and control activities in the field, and in resource mobilization. * * * 1 Health zone in DRC is District in others countries. 2 The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund.

Thirteen (13) patients are in isolation in Conakry (6 patients, 5 confirmed), Guekedou (7 patients, all confirmed). Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. Overall, the epidemiological situation in Guinea has improved significantly over the last few weeks. The date of onset of the last reported case from Macenta was 24 days ago and a similar time has elapsed for Dabola (25 days), Kissigougou (26) and Djingaraye (31 days). Two incubation periods (42 days) without cases is the standard for declaring an EVD outbreak over in a particular location. The focus of response activities at present includes clinical case management and ongoing training in hospital-based infection prevention and control (IPC). A documentary will be made on the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) isolation facility in Guekedou. WHO, in collaboration with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), has mobilized a new medical team comprising of IPC and intensive care physicians in support of the clinicians at the Donka Hospital in Conakry. The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, has arrived in Guinea to further strengthen diagnostic capacity for EVD by retesting patients who were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative by ebolavirus serology. The cross-border meeting on EVD response between the governments of Guinea and Liberia was successfully hosted by the Guinean government, attended by 25 participants from delegations from both countries. The overall objective of the meeting was to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and the follow up of contacts along the borders of the two countries in order to stop transmission of EVD. Key actions for implementation include: development of an action plan on the cross-border response to EVD; strengthening coordination of cross-border activities with engagement of local authorities; sharing information on the cross-border movement of suspected cases of EVD; reinforcing community awareness of EVD and ways to reduce personal and community risk of disease; and reinforcing active surveillance and contact tracing along the border as needed. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries. ### Liberia From 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 24 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a total of 35 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, 2 probable cases and 27 suspected cases.

"(' 1 May 2014 - On 26 April 2014, the Ministry of Health of Egypt reported the first laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the country. The patient is a 27 year-old man who has been living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the past 4 years. The patient had contact with a previously laboratory- confirmed case (his uncle) who died on 19 April, and another laboratory- confirmed case (neighbour of his uncle) who is still under treatment in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The patient became ill on 22 April, returned to Egypt on 25 April and was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on 26 April. The patient is currently in a stable condition. WHO has mobilized a team to support Saudi Arabia to review the current situation, identify information gaps to better understand the public health risk associated with the current upsurge in cases, particularly in health-care settings, and to determine the type of further investigations to be conducted, in order to understand the transmission chain and health care associated transmission. Saudi Arabia has provided information on 138 cases identified between 11 to 26 April 2014 in the country, including preliminary details of cases and deaths associated with the outbreak in Jeddah. WHO will update the global total of laboratory-confirmed cases of infections with MERS-CoV, including deaths, based on official information provided by Saudi Arabia as quickly as possible. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health- care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract. Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented. People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. ',)",1
"(' ### Guinea As of 18:00 on 1 May 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 226 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 149 deaths. Of 210 patients tested for ebolavirus infection, 127 cases have been laboratory confirmed by PCR, including 81 deaths. In addition, 44 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 55 cases (34 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-five (25) health-care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (11 confirmed). Seven (7) patients are in isolation facilities in Guinea; Conakry (4 patients, 2 confirmed) and Guekedou (3 patients, all confirmed). The geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (53 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (140/99), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (72/49); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed cases is 30 April in Conakry and Guekedou. Contact tracing activities continue in Conakry and Guekedou. Experts in epidemiology and social mobilization will be deployed to strengthen contact tracing teams in Guekedou. All the contacts from the other 4 outbreak locations have completed their 21-day medical surveillance period and have been discharged from follow up. The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR-negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries. ### Liberia The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has completed the process of revising clinical cases of EVD based on their final laboratory results. All cases which tested PCR positive or ebolavirus IgM positive have been reclassified as “confirmed acute” cases. PCR negative but ebolavirus IgG positive cases are considered “confirmed convalescent” cases. Following the reclassification of suspected cases, as of 2 May the total number of clinical EVD cases reported in Liberia is 13 (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 5 suspected cases), including 11 deaths. There were 2 confirmed cases in HCWs, both of whom died. There have been no new clinical cases in Liberia since 6 April. The above criteria will be used to classify future cases of EVD in Liberia, should they occur. In addition, in the situation where neither PCR nor serological testing is carried out and/or the results of repeated testing remain equivocal, future clinical cases and deaths will classified as either probable or suspected based on the presence of a clinically compatible illness and evidence of epidemiological linkage to known confirmed case(s). WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event. ',)",226

Introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases. ### Liberia and Sierra Leone There have been no new alerts in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia is preparing to host a cross-border meeting with Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone and surveillance activities have been enhanced in districts bordering Guinea. ### WHO response WHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities. As of 14 May, 118 experts have been deployed to assist in the response. This includes 56 experts deployed through the global WHO surge mechanism, 35 international experts from among partner institutions of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), 10 externally recruited consultants, and 17 WHO staff who were locally repurposed. To date, 90 experts have been deployed to Guinea, 22 to Liberia, two to Sierra Leone, and four to the WHO Regional Office for Africa. An additional, 7 deployments are planned in the disciplines of medical anthropology, clinical case management, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory services, logistics, and risk and media communications.

"(' ### Guinea Cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to occur in Guinea. As of May 23, 2014, 8 new cases and 3 new deaths were reported from one newly affected district, Telimele (3 cases and 0 deaths) and two existing affected areas, Gueckedou (2 cases and 0 deaths) and Macenta (3 cases and 3 deaths). Since the beginning of the outbreak, the cumulative total number of clinical cases of EVD is 258, including 174 deaths. The classification of these cases and deaths is as follows: confirmed (146 cases and 95 deaths); probable (67 cases and 57 deaths) and suspected (67 cases and 57 deaths). The geographical distribution of the clinical cases of EVD is as follows: Conakry (50 cases, including 25 deaths), Gueckedou (170/121), Macenta (22/17), Kissidougou (8/6), Dabola (4/4), Djinguiraye (1/1) and Telimele (3/0). The number of patients currently hospitalized is 9 (6 in Gueckedou and 3 in Telimele); that of contacts being actively followed-up is 153 (132 in Gueckedou and 41 in Telimele). The number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities. ### Liberia and Sierra Leone In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the situation continues to be stable with no new cases being reported. Social mobilization and surveillance activities are on- going. ### WHO response In response to the new cluster of cases and deaths in Guinea, WHO has redeployed experts to the affected areas to support the EVD investigation; active case search and contact follow-up; establishment of isolation facilities in Telimele; case management and infection prevention and control. A team of social mobilization experts trained by WHO has also been redeployed to support public health awareness with an emphasis on approaches to addressing community resistance from some villages.

Community health workers are being trained to do the follow up and contact listing is continuing in Kenema, Kailahun, Kambia, and Port Loko. ### Liberia Between 16 and 19 June 2014, a total of 7 new cases and 1 new death were reported from Lofa (5 cases and 0 deaths) and Montserrado (2 cases and 1 death). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Liberia to 41 (24 confirmed, 9 probable, and 8 suspected) and 25 deaths. The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Lofa, 28 cases and 14 deaths; Montserrado, 9 cases and 9 deaths; Margibi, 2 cases and 2 deaths; and Nimba, 2 cases and 0 deaths. Eight (8) patients are currently in the EVD Treatment Centres in Lofa. The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 108 and are distributed as follows: Lofa, 95 and Montserrado, 13. So far, 41.5% (108 completed the follow-up period out of a 260 contacts registered since the beginning of the outbreak) have completed the mandatory 21-day observation period. The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. ### WHO response WHO and its partners continue to provide the necessary technical expertise to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. This includes, among others, a high-level advocacy meeting with the governments of the three affected countries to enhance coordination, information management, and communication. The WHO Regional Director, in consultation with the Director General, has established a temporary function of WHO sub-regional EVD outbreak response Coordinator to directly support the affected countries. The Coordinator will be based in Conakry, Guinea. In addition, WHO is planning a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub-region to be held 2–3 July in Accra, Ghana, with the objective of ensuring increased political commitment and cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO, GOARN, and other partners are also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in deploying additional experts in the various specialities (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, data management, and logistics, among others) to support the EVD outbreak response efforts. The next cross-border technical meeting among the three countries is planned for 23 June 2014 in Kailahun, Sierra Leone. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ',)",136
"(' On 18 June 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for Brazil reported the isolation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from sewage samples collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport, in Campinas municipality in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Virus has been detected in the sewage only; sewage samples collected from the same site subsequent to the detection of WPV1 have been either negative or only positive for Sabin strains or non-polio enteroviruses; to date no case of paralytic polio has been reported. The isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance testing of sewage water; there is no evidence of transmission of WPV1. Genetic sequencing indicated a close match with a strain of WPV1 that was recently isolated from a case of polio in Equatorial Guinea. Additional epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The Americas Region has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1991 and Brazil since 1989. There is no indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus reported in Brazil since 1989. Brazil health authorities have enhanced their surveillance activity aimed to detect transmission of WPV1 and potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un-immunized persons. The vaccination coverage against polio in São Paulo State and Campinas municipality have been higher than 95% in the routine immunization program. The last national OPV campaign was conducted in June 2013. The campaign for this year is planned in November 2014 at the national level and the target group is children 6 months to less than 5 years of age with OPV. Specimens collected through environmental surveillance at this and other sites in Brazil since 1994 have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV. Given the high levels of population immunity indicated by the high routine immunization coverage and implementation of periodic vaccination campaigns in the area — no evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented — the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus from Brazil as very low. Given the ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, low national routine immunization coverage, and the inconsistent quality of the initial outbreak response vaccination campaigns, WHO assesses the risk of additional exportation from Equatorial Guinea as high. ### WHO note Brazil was not re-infected with WPV; the country was exposed to a poliovirus importation. The environmental surveillance system had the capacity to detect the poliovirus in sewage samples and the high immunity appears to have prevented transmission. ### WHO travel recommendations WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Brazil has detected a poliovirus importation event. Based on current evidence, the country is not considered polio-affected. ',)",0

"(' Based on epidemiological analysis conducted by WHO, three major factors are contributing to patterns of transmission, which are currently responsible for the continuous propagation of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the sub-region. These factors include transmission of EVD in rural communities, facilitated by strong cultural practices and traditional beliefs; transmission of EVD in densely populated peri-urban areas of Conakry in Guinea and Monrovia in Liberia; and cross-border transmission of EVD along the border areas of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where commercial and social activities continue among the border areas of these countries. ### Health sector response Containment of this outbreak requires a strong response in the countries and especially along their shared border areas. As one of the response elements, WHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub- region scheduled for 2–3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The meeting will bring together Ministers of Health and the Directors of disease prevention and control from 11 African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors, representatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities. The objective of the meeting is to analyse the situation, identify gaps, develop operational response plans, and to ensure increased political commitment and enhanced cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO and technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), including the EU Mobile Laboratory consortium, the IFRC, and national societies, Institut Pasteur Dakar, Institut Pasteur Lyon, Institut Pasteur Paris, Bernard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors without Borders, Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health England, and US CDC, together with UN agencies, DFID, EU, ECHO, and other partners are providing the necessary technical expertise and support to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. WHO is closely supporting the Ministries of Health through the deployment of additional experts in various specialties, providing field logistics support, and personal protective equipment and medical supplies. These experts are drawn from WHO offices, GOARN partners, specialised networks, especially in the region, and include: * Field epidemiologists, who are working with the countries in surveillance and monitoring of the outbreak; * Laboratory experts who are providing mobile field laboratories in early confirmation of Ebola cases; * Clinical management experts who are deployed to health facilities and are treating affected patients; * Infection and prevention control experts who are helping countries in their ongoing efforts to stop transmission of the virus in the community and health-care facilities; * Logisticians who are ensuring an operational response platform, and dispatching essential equipment and needed materials; and * Social mobilization and risk communications teams who are helping public health officials to develop and deliver appropriate messages about how to report, handle, and treat Ebola cases. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 25 and 30 June 2014, 22 new cases of EVD, including 14 deaths, were reported from the three countries, as follows: Guinea, 3 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 8 new cases with 7 deaths; and Sierra Leone 11 new cases and 2 deaths. These numbers include laboratory- confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 30 June 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 759, including 467 deaths.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance The evolution of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia remains a serious concern as primary and secondary viral transmissions continue to occur in both urban and rural communities. Analyses of the current trend and the potential risk factors for the continuing spread of this epidemic have been conducted. The major factors responsible for continuous propagation of EVD outbreak in the sub-region include: 1\\. Some negative cultural practices and traditional beliefs, resulting into mistrust, apprehension and resistance to adopt recommended public health preventive measures. The implication of this include poor health care seeking behaviour such as hiding of EVD patients, home-based management of EVD patients, and customary treatment of dead bodies. These are very high risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community. Consequently, community deaths continue to be reported. In addition, the potential contacts to the EVD patients managed at home and exposures during customary burial procedures are not systematically identified and put under observation (very critical measures for containment of community transmission of Ebola virus). This is therefore a major factor amplifying the outbreak. 2\\. The extensive movement of people within and across borders has facilitated rapid spread of the infection across and within the three countries. The homogeneous community living along the border areas have common socio-cultural activities that enhance viral transmission e.g. visiting sick relatives or attending to burial ceremonies of relatives across the border. In addition, the cross border movement has complicated tracking and follow up of contacts, with several contacts loss to follow up. 3\\. Currently, the coverage of effective outbreak containment measures is not comprehensive. The unprecedented geographical expanse of the EVD outbreak in the three countries requires enormous and robust response capacity and structures in terms of human capital, financial, operational and logistics requirements. This is the first major EVD outbreak in West Africa and the affected countries had weak capacity and structures for epidemic preparedness and response, particularly for viral haemorrhagic fever. Lastly, the apprehension of some communities limits access to affected population with effective outbreak control measures. ### Health sector response In an effort to rapidly interrupt further spread of the Ebola virus, the World Health Organization convened a special Ministerial meeting on Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. The meeting, held on 2-3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana, brings together Ministers of Health and senior health officials from 11 African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors, representatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities. The objective of the meeting was to obtain consensus from Member States and partners on the optimal ways to interrupt the ongoing Ebola virus transmission in West Africa in order to reduce the human, social and economic impact of the current and future EVD outbreaks. The meeting focused on getting a clear understanding of current situation and response, including gaps and challenges; developing a comprehensive operational response plan for controlling the outbreak; priority preparedness activities to be implemented by countries at risk; and engagement of national authorities to optimally respond to EVD outbreak. WHO, technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), UN agencies and donors continue to provide the necessary technical support to the Ministries of Health to stop the transmission of the EVD in the communities and health facilities. The support is provided in the form of deployment of additional experts; provision of field logistics; and provision of equipment which include the establishment of field laboratories, personal protective equipment and medical supplies. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Summary statistics New cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 1and 2 July 2014, 21 new cases of EVD, including 14 deaths, were reported from the three countries, as follows: Guinea, 0 new case and 2 deaths; Liberia, 8 new cases with 10 deaths; and Sierra Leone 13 new cases and 2 deaths. These numbers include laboratory- confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 2 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 779, including 481 deaths.

These numbers indicate that active viral transmission continues in the community. * There has been a reduction in the number of new EVD cases reported in Guinea, with no new cases during the last 7 days. WHO continues to encourage and support outbreak containment measures in the three countries. ### Health sector response Health Ministers and technical staff from 11 countries, representatives from WHO, and key international partner organizations met in an Emergency Ministerial meeting in Accra, Ghana July 2 and 3 to address the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. After hearing technical updates and sharing country and field experiences, they agreed on a strategy for an accelerated operational response to control the outbreak with priority actions to address the serious threat to countries in West Africa. In agreeing to priorities and actions, it was acknowledged that a number of gaps and challenges remain. To address these, the World Health Organization (WHO) will establish a Sub-Regional Centre in Guinea to act as a coordinating platform to consolidate and harmonize the technical support to West African countries by all major partners and to assist in resource mobilization. Delegates to the meeting also emphasized the importance of WHO leading an international effort to promote research on EVD and other haemorrhagic fevers. Among the key priorities at this time are: * mobilization of community, religious, and political leaders to improve awareness about and understanding of EVD; * strengthening surveillance, case finding, and contact tracing; * deploying additional human resources with relevant qualifications to key hot spots; * identifying and committing additional domestic financial resources; * organizing cross-border consultations to facilitate an ongoing exchange of information; and * working together and sharing experiences with countries that have previously managed EVD outbreaks in the spirit of south-south cooperation. In addition, national intersectoral meetings involving key government ministries, national technical committees, and other stakeholders will be held to map out a plan for immediate implementation of a sub-regional response strategy. It has also been recommended that issues related specifically to the EVD outbreak be addressed at an upcoming summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Heads of States.

To address these, the World Health Organization (WHO) will establish a Sub-Regional Centre in Guinea to act as a coordinating platform to consolidate and harmonize the technical support to West African countries by all major partners and to assist in resource mobilization. Delegates to the meeting also emphasized the importance of WHO leading an international effort to promote research on EVD and other haemorrhagic fevers. Among the key priorities at this time are: * mobilization of community, religious, and political leaders to improve awareness about and understanding of EVD; * strengthening surveillance, case finding, and contact tracing; * deploying additional human resources with relevant qualifications to key hot spots; * identifying and committing additional domestic financial resources; * organizing cross-border consultations to facilitate an ongoing exchange of information; and * working together and sharing experiences with countries that have previously managed EVD outbreaks in the spirit of south-south cooperation. In addition, national intersectoral meetings involving key government ministries, national technical committees, and other stakeholders will be held to map out a plan for immediate implementation of a sub-regional response strategy. It has also been recommended that issues related specifically to the EVD outbreak be addressed at an upcoming summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Heads of States. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 3 and 6 July 2014, 50 new cases of EVD, including 25 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 0 new cases and 2 deaths; Liberia, 16 new cases with 9 deaths; and Sierra Leone 34 new cases and 14 deaths. These numbers include laboratory- confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 6 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 844, including 518 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 408 cases (294 confirmed, 96 probable, and 18 suspected) and 307 deaths (195 confirmed, 96 probable, and 16 suspected); Liberia, 131 cases (63 confirmed, 30 probable, and 38 suspected) and 84 deaths (41 confirmed, 28 probable, and 15 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 305 cases (269 confirmed, 34 probable, and 2 suspected) and 127 deaths (114 confirmed, 11 probable, and 2 suspected). ### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 6 July 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country Guinea Cases 0 294 96 18 408 Deaths 2 195 96 16 307 Liberia Cases 16 63 30 38 131 Deaths 9 41 28 15 84 Sierra Leone Cases 34 269 34 2 305 Deaths 14 114 11 2 127 Totals Cases 50 626 160 58 844 Deaths 25 350 135 33 518 (1) New cases were reported between 3 and 6 July 2014.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, the current epidemic trend shows low activity of community viral transmission, with only 1 confirmed EVD case reported in the last 7 days. This trend is being closely monitored, particularly in communities that had resistance to recommended outbreak control measure. The epidemic trend in Liberia and Sierra Leone remains precarious with high numbers of new cases and deaths being reported. The current active foci of the EVD outbreak have been identified as Kailahun and Kenema in Sierra Leone and Lofa and Montserrado in Liberia. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and its partners to step up containment measures. ### Health sector response As part of the effort to control this outbreak, Dr Keiji Fukuda, the Assistant Director-General for WHO’s Health Security cluster and Dr Benido Impouma, the Sub-regional Coordinator for the outbreak response visited Sierra Leone and Guinea from 7–10 July 2014. The WHO’s delegation engaged and had dialogue with high-level political and Government authorities aimed to enhance national leadership and commitment. The delegation also held discussions with the national coordination structures for EVD outbreak response, including partners, in order to strengthen coordination, communication, and inter- sectoral collaboration. A Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre for the response is being established in Conakry, Guinea. The centre will act as a control and coordination platform to consolidate and harmonize the technical support to West African countries and to assist in resource mobilization. The Sub-regional Centre will be responsible for ensuring effective use and deployment of limited and scarce, but highly critical resources based on prioritization and agreed objectives. The organization and coordination of key support functions and field operations will move closer to outbreak areas, or hot spots. In addition, the Sub-regional Centre will: * Ensure sufficient technical and operational support and resources to sustain response activities in the field, facilitate the coordination of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners and networks, prepare public communications materials and activities, engage in contingency planning, risk assessments, and scaling of operations as required, and secure an environment that enables effective and successful field operations. * Define operational periods to achieve agreed objectives and ensure the planning, coordination, and optimum use of limited resources, as well as continuity of action and management. * Direct human and material resources to communications and social mobilization, investigation of alerts and new outbreaks, case finding and contact tracing, surveillance and data management, patient treatment and care, logistics, stockpiling, and movement of personal protective equipment to key locations. * Provide technical guidance and resources, communications support, decision-making, and reporting for all field teams in the subregion.

In Liberia, 30 new cases and 13 deaths were reported, while in Sierra Leone, 49 new cases and 52 deaths have been reported. These include suspect, probable and laboratory confirmed cases. This trend indicates that a high level of transmission of the Ebola Virus continues to take place in the community. The epidemic situation in Guinea is being closely observed, with 6 new cases and 3 deaths reported between 8 – 12 July 2014. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and partners to step up outbreak containment measures. ### Health sector response As a follow up action to the Emergency Ministerial meeting in Accra, the Regional Director, WHO African Region has taken a decision to re-deploy senior, technical, and support staff to the sub-regional coordination centre that is being established in Conakry, Guinea. The personnel re-assigned include a Director, Regional Advisors, epidemiologists, communication experts, social mobilization specialists, data managers, administrative officers, and other support staff. Preparation to establish the coordination centre is being finalized, with operations of the centre scheduled to be activated on 15 July 2014. The centre will act as a control and coordination platform, consolidating and harmonizing the technical support to the West African countries including assisting in resource mobilization. The three affected countries, with support from WHO, have initiated the process of reviewing and updating the current EVD national response plans. This exercise will lead to the development of prioritized national operational plans, aligned to the inter-country strategy adopted by the Ministers of Health in Accra. The operational plan will clearly highlight priority interventions and map out the required resources (human, financial, and logistics) for effective implementation of the outbreak containment measures. In addition, these documents will be vital for mobilization of the additional resources. WHO is currently supporting the affected countries to strengthen contact tracing, as one of the most effective outbreak containment measures. Early detection and prompt isolation of new EVD cases is requisite for interrupting secondary transmission of Ebola virus in the community. Therefore, WHO supported the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) of Liberia to identify and train 107 community volunteers and 33 supervisors. In Sierra Leone, a total of 296 community volunteers have been trained. The trained volunteers have been deployed in the affected communities to conduct contact tracing and ensure immediate evacuation of suspected EVD cases from the community. In response to a request from MOHSW Liberia, WHO, with support from the Government of the United States of America, has supplied personal protective equipment (PPE) for and other medical supplies to Liberia in order to ensure the safety of health-care workers in their response efforts. This donation, was handed over to MOHSW Liberia on 26 June and 3 July, included PPE appropriate for use by both clinical care and burial teams. On 14 July, additional supplies, including backpack sprayers and hand sprayers for disinfection as well disposal bags for biohazard wastes, were delivered to the country.

New cases and deaths attributed to EVD continue to be reported from the three countries. Between 13 – 14 July 2014, 18 new cases and 11 deaths were reported from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The occurrence of community deaths, still being reported in Guinea, remains a serious concern. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and its partners to step up outbreak containment measures. ### Health sector response The national authorities in the three affected countries are scaling up outbreak containment measures. In Sierra Leone, the Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) aimed at ensuring effective coordination and accelerating implementation of the EVD outbreak response. The EOC is chaired by the Minister of Health and co-chaired by the WHO Representative for Sierra Leone, with members including heads of the different sub-committees of the task force, other senior staff, and key partners. The EOC will oversee the development of the prioritized operational plan in line with the Accra inter-country strategy, ensure that priority interventions are implemented as planned, and streamline communication and information flow. In Guinea, a high level political delegation comprised of the President of the National Assembly, the Ministers of Health and Communication, and senior government officials conducted a 3-day field visit to Guéckédou, from 14 – 17 July 2014. Outbreak response teams in Guéckédou, where community deaths continue to be reported, encountered resistance and apprehension from the communities. The delegation engaged local and opinion leaders in order to build a relationship of trust with the community, which should foster cooperation and enhance acceptance of outbreak control measures. As a result of this engagement and dialogue, leaders of 19 out of 23 villages pledged their commitment to embrace the EVD outbreak response. Meanwhile, leaders of the four villages that did not turn up for the meeting later made contacts with the local administrative authority, expressing their willingness to be part of the response. In addition, the national authority has established administrative and law enforcement mechanisms to deal with extreme instances of resistance, such as violence towards the response teams. In Liberia, the Chief Medical Officer including senior officials of the Ministry of Health, WHO, and other partners visited Foya district, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. The field visit aimed to streamline and strengthen implementation of outbreak containment measures. The delegation participated in the district task force meeting and held discussions with the district authority, partners and health care workers.

"(' As of 16 July 2014, Equatorial Guinea has reported a total of 5 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, with onset of paralysis between 28 January 2014 (first case) and 3 May 2014 (most recent case). Genetic sequencing indicated that the cases are linked to the ongoing outbreak in Cameroon. A national emergency action plan to respond to the polio outbreak was developed by the Ministry of Health and polio partner agencies and is being implemented. Three nationwide campaigns with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) have already been conducted in the country - two campaigns targeting children under 15 years old in April 2014 and early May 2014, and one in late May 2014 targeting children under 5 years old. Two nationwide bOPV campaigns are planned for mid-July 2014 and mid-August 2014; the July 2014 round will target the entire population, and the August 2014 round will target children under 15 years old. As noted in the Disease Outbreak News update published on 25 June 2014, Brazil reported on 18 June 2014 that WPV1 had been detected in a sewage sample collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport in Sao Paulo state, with genetic sequencing indicating that this virus is most closely related to the virus currently circulating in Equatorial Guinea. No further samples have tested positive to date in Brazil, nor have any paralytic polio cases been detected there. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR) Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General of WHO on 5 May 2014, Equatorial Guinea is considered as a polio exporting country. The country is therefore working to ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (of more than 4 weeks) who travel internationally receive a supplementary dose of polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to departure.

Some of the gaps identified include low coverage of contact tracing; persisting denial and resistance in the community; weak data management; inadequate infection prevention and control practices, especially in peripheral health facilities; and weak leadership and coordination at sub- national levels. Underpinning these challenges were limited financial resources and human technical capacity. Comprehensive mapping of the financial, logistics, and human resource needs will be articulated in the national operational plan under development. This exercise of developing prioritized operational plans is also being conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Following the call for regional collaboration during the Accra Ministerial meeting, the Government and the Ministry of Health of Gambia provided a team of 11 health-care workers to support outbreak response in Sierra Leone.

Between 18 – 20 July 2014, 45 new cases and 28 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The respective Ministries of Health continue to work with WHO and its partners to implement outbreak containment measures. ### Health sector response The Regional Director, WHO African Region, began official visits to the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone on 21 July 2014. On the first leg of his mission, the Regional Director visited Liberia from 21 - 22 July 2014. The goal of the visit is to make a first-hand assessment of the EVD outbreak, review the current outbreak response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the EVD outbreak in West Africa. The Regional Director held official meetings with the President of Liberia and the Minister of Health, including senior government officials. The President and the Regional Director also participated in the Ebola national coordination meeting at the Ministry of Health. During this meeting, the Regional Director emphasized the need to step up implementation of key outbreak containment strategies, including community engagement and involvement, effective contact tracing, cross-border collaboration and effective coordination. Discussions were also held with international and local non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, and other stakeholders to enhance collaboration and effective coordination. The Regional Director called upon all partners to be fully involved in the EVD outbreak response. Following his visit to Liberia, significant financial contributions and commitments were made, including from the Government and partners. In Liberia, the Minister of Health launched the national strategic plan for accelerated response to the EVD outbreak. The plan is aligned to the inter- country strategy for accelerated response to the outbreak, adopted in the Accra Ministerial meeting. It is expected that the launch and subsequent implementation of this strategic plan will bring tangible improvement and scale up effective outbreak containment measures at field level. Similarly, the Ministry of Health and partners in Guinea and Sierra Leone are conducting planning meetings to re-strategize and come up with concrete, action-oriented national operational plans to accelerate the response to the EVD outbreak response. Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 18 – 20 July 2014, 45 new cases of EVD, including 28 new deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 5 new cases and 4 deaths; Liberia, 28 new cases with 11 deaths; and Sierra Leone 12 new cases and 13 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 20 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 093, including 660 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 415 cases (304 confirmed, 98 probable, and 13 suspected) and 314 deaths (204 confirmed, 98 probable, and 12 suspected); Liberia, 224 cases (77 confirmed, 68 probable, and 79 suspected) and 127 deaths (56 confirmed, 44 probable, and 27 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 454 cases (405 confirmed, 35 probable, and 14 suspected) and 219 deaths (182 confirmed, 32 probable, and 5 suspected). ### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 20 July 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country Guinea Cases 5 304 98 13 415 Deaths 4 204 98 12 314 Liberia Cases 28 77 68 79 224 Deaths 11 56 44 27 127 Sierra Leone Cases 12 405 35 14 454 Deaths 13 182 32 5 219 Totals Cases 45 786 201 106 1 093 Deaths 28 442 174 44 660 1\\.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance WHO continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The Ebola epidemic trend remains precarious, with community and health-facility transmissions of infection still taking place. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD cases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected chains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is retrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up outbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing. In addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable case of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old Liberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in hospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while traveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died on 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis was conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital and tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working closely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained at the source. ### Health sector response In an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community and development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies again pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are underway to secure additional human and financial resources. The Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his fact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia earlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and Guinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD outbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with Presidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials, international and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held. During the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the outbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection prevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each national health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected countries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and communities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re- deploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to the field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural practices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border collaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to coordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the Regional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries and reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community in support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak. On 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director officially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical support at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked its partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to sit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre. The establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency Ministerial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance WHO continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The Ebola epidemic trend remains precarious, with community and health-facility transmissions of infection still taking place. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD cases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected chains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is retrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up outbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing. In addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable case of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old Liberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in hospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while traveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died on 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis was conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital and tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working closely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained at the source. ### Health sector response In an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community and development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies again pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are underway to secure additional human and financial resources. The Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his fact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia earlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and Guinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD outbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with Presidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials, international and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held. During the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the outbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection prevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each national health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected countries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and communities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re- deploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to the field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural practices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border collaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to coordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the Regional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries and reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community in support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak. On 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director officially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical support at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked its partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to sit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre. The establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency Ministerial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month. Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the response in the three countries, including contact tracking, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 108 new cases of EVD, including 12 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 25 new cases with 2 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 71 new cases and 5 death. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 23 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 201, including 672 deaths.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 24 and 27 July 2014, a total of 122 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD; laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 57 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. The Ebola epidemic trend in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone remains precarious with ongoing community and health-facility transmissions of infection. The surge in the number of new EVD cases calls for concentrated efforts by all to address the identified problems, such as health facility transmission and effective contact tracing. On 29 July 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for Nigeria confirmed that the probable EVD case notified to WHO on 27 July 2014 was symptomatic at the time of arrival in Nigeria and that 59 contacts (15 from among the airport staff and 44 from the hospital) have been identified so far. The report also confirms that the patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20 July via Lomé, Togo, and Accra, Ghana. The sample from this case is yet to be sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, due to refusal by courier companies to transport this sample. Though only one probable case has been detected so far in Nigeria, Ebola virus infection in this country represents a significant development in the course of this outbreak. National authorities in Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo continue to work closely with WHO and it partners in identification of contacts and contact tracing as well as in preparing response plans. ### Health sector response In an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, the Director General of WHO and other senior managers continue to hold discussions with the donor community, development partners, and international agencies at a global level. Focus of the discussion has centered on the need to rapidly deploy additional human and financial resources that will help interrupt Ebola transmission and end the outbreak. Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the response in the four countries, including epidemiologic investigations, contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, coordination, and staff security. WHO is also working closely with various partners to finalize the national response plans that define urgent response needs in line with the Accra strategy adopted by Member States. WHO and it partners – GOARN, CDC, MSF, UNICEF, IFRC, Institute Pasteur of Dakar, Save the Children, Plan Guinea, and others – continue to work together through the Sub-regional Ebola Outbreak Coordination Center (SEOCC) in Conakry to accelerate the control of this outbreak.

A Joint Declaration of Heads of State and Government of the Mano River Union (comprised of Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) was issued and leaders pledged to commit additional resources to the outbreak. This will include the following measures: * Actions at the inter-country level to focus on cross-border regions, including isolation of specific areas by police and military and material support to the citizens in these areas. Health-care centers in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing, and contact tracing. Burials will be done in accordance with national health regulations. * Provision of incentives, treatment, and protection for health personnel so they can feel safe in their jobs and perform their duties. In addition, security for national and international personnel supporting the fight against Ebola will also be assured. * A commitment by Heads of State to do their part to bring the outbreak to an end as soon as possible. To this end, the international community will support affected countries to build capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, case management, and laboratory capacity. * Mobilization of the private and public sectors to work in synergy and increase sensitization efforts to enable communities to understand EVD for effective and efficient eradication. * Involve all sectors in immediate implementation of necessary interventions outlined in national response plans; harmonize and coordinate these measures; deploy national and international human resources with appropriate skills; mobilize and allocate appropriate financial resources; strengthen surveillance of cross-border movement. * Improve information and communications systems in an effort to strengthen sensitization and promote community participation, taking into account cultural contexts. * Improve infection prevention and control measures in all treatment centres to prevent health personnel from contracting and dying from EVD. * Put in place a monitoring and evaluation system of regional strategies and conduct research around the disease. Human and financial resource mobilization continues to be sought from WHO’s partners, UN agencies, and other stakeholders. On Friday, WHO and the affected countries issued the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan in West Africa covering Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, neighbouring states, and other countries in the region from July-December 2014.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 31 July and 1 August 2014, a total of 163 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD; laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 61 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Three of these cases are in Nigeria and include two new probable cases — one is a health-care worker and one is a Nigerian who travelled to Guinea — and a suspected case in a nurse. National authorities in Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo continue to work closely with WHO and its partners in identification of contacts and contact tracing as well as in preparing response plans as a result of the recent visit by and death of a Liberian national to Nigeria from EVD and the new Nigerian EVD probable case, who travelled to Guinea. ### Health sector response The Director-General of the World Health Organization visited Guinea and held high-level meetings with the Presidents of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to review the status of the Ebola epidemic and adopt common strategies to eradicate Ebola from the sub-region. A Joint Declaration of Heads of State and Government of the Mano River Union (comprised of Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) was issued and leaders pledged to commit additional resources to the outbreak. This will include the following measures: * Actions at the inter-country level to focus on cross-border regions, including isolation of specific areas by police and military and material support to the citizens in these areas. Health-care centers in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing, and contact tracing. Burials will be done in accordance with national health regulations. * Provision of incentives, treatment, and protection for health personnel so they can feel safe in their jobs and perform their duties. In addition, security for national and international personnel supporting the fight against Ebola will also be assured. * A commitment by Heads of State to do their part to bring the outbreak to an end as soon as possible. To this end, the international community will support affected countries to build capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, case management, and laboratory capacity. * Mobilization of the private and public sectors to work in synergy and increase sensitization efforts to enable communities to understand EVD for effective and efficient eradication. * Involve all sectors in immediate implementation of necessary interventions outlined in national response plans; harmonize and coordinate these measures; deploy national and international human resources with appropriate skills; mobilize and allocate appropriate financial resources; strengthen surveillance of cross-border movement. * Improve information and communications systems in an effort to strengthen sensitization and promote community participation, taking into account cultural contexts. * Improve infection prevention and control measures in all treatment centres to prevent health personnel from contracting and dying from EVD. * Put in place a monitoring and evaluation system of regional strategies and conduct research around the disease. Human and financial resource mobilization continues to be sought from WHO’s partners, UN agencies, and other stakeholders.

Information about the nature of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was highlighted. This was followed by outlining the essential components for control, including the need for national leadership, improved care and case management, identifying transmission chains and stopping disease spread, and preventing further outbreaks. Among the critical issues are: cross-border infections and travelers; partners reaching the limits of their capacity and ability to respond rapidly, safely, and effectively; and concerns about the socio-economic impact of continued transmission. The Director-General also shared information from her recent meetings in Guinea with Member States of the Mano River Union – Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. She outlined that the response in West Africa would focus on three areas: * Treatment of Guéckédou, Kenema, and Foya as a unified sector, which will include public health measures meant to reduce movement in and out of the area. * Intensifying current measures in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. * Taking steps to reduce international spread to other countries in Africa and outside of the African Region. The Sub-regional Ebola Operations Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry reported on 5 August that the following actions are underway in the four affected countries: * In Guinea, new foci have emerged and case management facilities will be needed. Exit screening is currently being tested in Conakry, in partnership with the US CDC. * In Liberia, security issues continue to be of concern, notwithstanding the commitment of the Government. Community resistance remains high. * In Nigeria, the Government is focused on following up the contacts from the index case. Clinical support is urgently needed and a treatment centre is being set up for managing cases of EVD. * In Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to map where treatment centres are most needed and getting those set up. A similar exercise is underway for laboratories. The SEOCC is assisting countries with these and many other response measures. On 6 August, WHO is convening an Emergency Committee of international experts to review the outbreak and advise the Director-General, in accordance with the International Health Regulations, whether the Ebola virus disease outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Experts will receive an epidemiological briefing and will determine whether the criteria for a PHEIC have been met.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 2 and 4 August 2014, a total of 108 new cases of Ebola virus disease (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 45 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. ### Health sector response A mission briefing with representatives from Member States was held on 5 August at the World Health Organization (WHO). Information about the nature of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was highlighted. This was followed by outlining the essential components for control, including the need for national leadership, improved care and case management, identifying transmission chains and stopping disease spread, and preventing further outbreaks. Among the critical issues are: cross-border infections and travelers; partners reaching the limits of their capacity and ability to respond rapidly, safely, and effectively; and concerns about the socio-economic impact of continued transmission. The Director-General also shared information from her recent meetings in Guinea with Member States of the Mano River Union – Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. She outlined that the response in West Africa would focus on three areas: * Treatment of Guéckédou, Kenema, and Foya as a unified sector, which will include public health measures meant to reduce movement in and out of the area. * Intensifying current measures in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. * Taking steps to reduce international spread to other countries in Africa and outside of the African Region. The Sub-regional Ebola Operations Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry reported on 5 August that the following actions are underway in the four affected countries: * In Guinea, new foci have emerged and case management facilities will be needed. Exit screening is currently being tested in Conakry, in partnership with the US CDC. * In Liberia, security issues continue to be of concern, notwithstanding the commitment of the Government. Community resistance remains high. * In Nigeria, the Government is focused on following up the contacts from the index case. Clinical support is urgently needed and a treatment centre is being set up for managing cases of EVD. * In Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to map where treatment centres are most needed and getting those set up. A similar exercise is underway for laboratories. The SEOCC is assisting countries with these and many other response measures. On 6 August, WHO is convening an Emergency Committee of international experts to review the outbreak and advise the Director-General, in accordance with the International Health Regulations, whether the Ebola virus disease outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Experts will receive an epidemiological briefing and will determine whether the criteria for a PHEIC have been met. If the Emergency Committee agrees that this is a PHEIC, they will then advise the Director-General on temporary recommendations. A summary of the meeting will be made public and a press briefing will be held on Friday, 8 August. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 5 and 6 August 2014, a total of 68 new cases of Ebola virus disease (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 29 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. ### Health sector response On Wednesday, 6 August and Thursday, 7 August, an Emergency Committee was held via teleconference to determine whether the current outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee advised that: * the Ebola outbreak in West Africa constitutes an ‘extraordinary event’ and a public health risk to other States; * the possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries. * a coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola. It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met.

On Friday, 8 August, the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, gave a press briefing to the international media from WHO Headquarters. Dr Chan will give an additional briefing on the situation of the outbreak and the ongoing response in the region to the Permanent and Observer Missions to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva on Tuesday, 12 August. Permanent Representatives of the affected countries have been invited to speak on behalf of their respective Governments on the national Ebola response and priorities. On Monday, 11 August, WHO will convene a panel of medical ethics experts to begin looking at the use of experimental treatments in the ongoing EVD outbreak in West Africa. At this time, there are no registered medicines or vaccines against this deadly virus; several experimental options are currently under development, though. The recent treatment of two health workers from US faith-based aid organizations has raised questions about whether medicines that have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans should be used in outbreak situations. In the case of Ebola, supplies are extremely limited, which then raises questions about who should receive it, if it’s used. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 7 and 9 August 2014, a total of 69 new cases of Ebola virus disease (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 52 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. ### Health sector response The recent treatment of two health workers, who were infected with EVD, with an experimental medicine has raised important questions about whether medicines or treatments that have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans should be used in this outbreak. Currently, quantities of the medicine are limited, which also raises questions about who should receive the treatment. On 11 August, WHO convened a panel of medical ethicists, scientific experts, and lay people from the affected countries to assess the role of experimental therapies in the Ebola outbreak response. Two issues were considered. * Is it ethical to use unregistered interventions with unknown adverse effects for possible treatment or prophylaxis? If it is, what criteria and conditions need to be satisfied before they can be used? * If it is ethical to use these unregistered interventions in the current circumstances, then what criteria should guide the choice of an intervention and who should receive priority for treatment or prevention?

To reduce the likelihood that those who are infected will carry the disease outside their communities, the governments have set up quarantine zones in areas of high transmission including severely-affected cities such as Gueckedou in Guinea, Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone and Foya in Liberia. This prevents people living in these areas from moving to other parts of the country and potentially increasing EVD transmission. However, it also means that barriers to travel limit their access to food and other necessities. While preventing further transmission of EVD is crucial, it is essential that people in those zones have access to food, water, good sanitation and other basic supplies. WHO is working with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure people in the quarantine zones receive regular food aid and other non-medical supplies. WFP is now scaling up its programme to distribute food to the around 1 million people living in the quarantine zones in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Food has been delivered to hospitalized patients and people under quarantine who are not able to leave their homes to purchase food. Providing regular food supplies is a potent means of limiting unnecessary movement. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

To reduce the likelihood that those who are infected will carry the disease outside their communities, the governments have set up quarantine zones in areas of high transmission including severely-affected cities such as Gueckedou in Guinea, Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone and Foya in Liberia. This prevents people living in these areas from moving to other parts of the country and potentially increasing EVD transmission. However, it also means that barriers to travel limit their access to food and other necessities. While preventing further transmission of EVD is crucial, it is essential that people in those zones have access to food, water, good sanitation and other basic supplies. WHO is working with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure people in the quarantine zones receive regular food aid and other non-medical supplies. WFP is now scaling up its programme to distribute food to the around 1 million people living in the quarantine zones in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Food has been delivered to hospitalized patients and people under quarantine who are not able to leave their homes to purchase food. Providing regular food supplies is a potent means of limiting unnecessary movement. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

WHO is working with the UN World Food Programme to ensure adequate food and supplies, but calls on companies to make business decisions based on scientific evidence with regard to the transmission of Ebola virus.

It is important to understand that EVD is not an airborne disease. Individuals may become infected as a result of contact with the bodily fluids (vomit, diarrhoea, sputum, blood, etc.) from persons who are confirmed to have EVD or who have died from EVD. Companies bringing goods and services to the affected countries are at low risk for exposure to EVD and WHO, under the International Health Regulations, encourages companies and organizations to continue providing these necessary supplies. Countries around the world continue to engage in active surveillance for cases of EVD. Reports have been received by WHO of suspected cases and systematic verification is underway in a number of countries to confirm whether these are actual EVD cases.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 19 and 20 August 2014, a total of 142 new cases of Ebola virus disease (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 77 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. ### Health sector response Questions have been received in WHO Headquarters about the original proposed budget for the response and the new draft budget, which is being reviewed by partners. The increase in needed resources is based on improved data and understanding of the situation on the ground in the affected countries. The new estimation of costs is derived using a unit-cost model, built for the most intense transmission areas and reflects the average operational costs based on the current situation in the affected countries. The major assumptions for the cost estimates will be announced towards the end of next week. WHO continues to receive reports of rumoured or suspected cases from countries around the world and systematic verification of these cases is ongoing. Countries are encouraged to continue engaging in active surveillance and preparedness activities. As of today, no new cases have been confirmed outside of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance On 26 August 2014, the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Equateur Province. The index case was a pregnant woman from Ikanamongo Village who butchered a bush animal that had been killed and given to her by her husband. She became ill with symptoms of EVD and reported to a private clinic in Isaka Village. On 11 August 2014, she died of a then-unidentified haemorrhagic fever. Local customs and rituals associated with death meant that several health-care workers were exposed and presented with similar symptoms in the following week. Between 28 July and 18 August 2014, a total of 24 suspected cases of haemorrhagic fever, including 13 deaths, have been identified. Human-to-human transmission has been established and includes the health-care personnel who were exposed to the deceased pregnant woman during surgery (one doctor and two nurses) in addition to the hygienist and a ward boy, all of whom developed symptoms and died. Other deaths have been recorded among the relatives who attended the index case, individuals who were in contact with the clinic staff, and those who handled the bodies of the deceased during funerals. The other 11 cases are currently being treated in isolation centres. Samples have been sent to laboratories in Kinshasa and in Gabon for confirmation of EVD and to identify the strain. The index case and the 80 contacts have no history of travel to the EVD-affected countries in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone) or history of contact with individuals from the affected areas. At this time, it is believed that the outbreak in DRC is unrelated to the ongoing outbreak in west Africa. ### Health sector response The Ministry of Health of DRC has dispatched field teams to the area to monitor and evaluate the situation. Contact tracing has begun and 80 individuals are currently being followed-up. Treatment of patients is ongoing and infection prevention and control measures are in place and are being supported by WHO with the delivery of personal protective equipment to the area. WHO is currently monitoring the situation with the Government of DRC and awaiting confirmation of the disease strain from the laboratories. A rapid response team is poised to deploy and assist DRC, if needed. This is the seventh outbreak of EVD in the former Zaire / present DRC since 1976. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance On 30 August 2014, Senegal’s Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs provided WHO with details about a case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) announced in that country on 29 August. WHO has also received details of the emergency investigation immediately launched by the Government. Testing and confirmation of Ebola were undertaken by a laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar. The case is a 21-year-old male native of Guinea, who arrived in Dakar, by road, on 20 August and stayed with relatives at a home in the outskirts of the city. On 23 August, he sought medical care for symptoms that included fever, diarrhoea, and vomiting. He received treatment for malaria, but did not improve and left the facility. After leaving the facility, he continued to reside with his relatives. Though the investigation is in its early stages, he is not presently known to have travelled elsewhere. On 26 August, he was referred to a specialized facility for infectious diseases, still showing the same symptoms, and was hospitalized. On 27 August, authorities in Conakry, Guinea, issued an alert, informing medical services in Guinea and neighbouring countries, that a person, who was a close contact of a confirmed EVD patient, had escaped the surveillance system. That alert prompted testing at the Dakar laboratory, launched an investigation, and triggered urgent contact tracing. ### Health sector response WHO is treating this first case in Senegal as a top priority emergency. Key operational personnel were dispatched to Dakar today; others will follow. The Government of Senegal has informed WHO of the urgent need for epidemiological support, personal protective equipment, and hygiene kits. These needs will be met with the fastest possible speed. WHO continues to monitor for reports of rumoured or suspected cases from countries around the world and systematic verification of these cases is ongoing. Countries are encouraged to continue engaging in active surveillance and preparedness activities.

"(' On 6 October 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of the first confirmed autochthonous case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Spain. This case represents the first human-to-human transmission of EVD outside Africa. The case is a female healthcare worker with no travel history to West Africa but who participated in the medical care of an EVD case in a Spanish citizen, who had been infected in Sierra Leone and evacuated to Madrid, Spain on 22 September 2014 and who died on 25 September 2014. She was in contact with the repatriated EVD case twice; on 24 and 25 September 2014. On both occasions she is reported to have worn appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE). Following the Spanish national protocol for EVD cases, the healthcare worker was considered a low risk contact and monitored accordingly. The female case developed a fever on 29 September 2014 and was admitted into isolation on 6 October 2014 at Alcorcon Hospital in Madrid. The case was then transferred to La Paz-Carlos III Hospital in Madrid and is being treated under isolation. Samples were collected and sent for testing to the National Reference Laboratory on 6 October 2014. Results were positive for Ebola virus on the same day. The Spanish public health authorities are conducting an investigation to elucidate the mode of transmission. Identification of close contacts for daily monitoring for 21 days after exposure is underway for the recent case and is continuing for contacts of the Spanish citizen who was treated in Spain.

"("" On 9 November 2014, WHO was notified by the National IHR Focal Point for Portugal of a large outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Vila Franca de Xira, a suburban area of Lisbon. ### Details of the cases are as follows: The first 17 cases were identified between 6 and 7 November. Since then, the number of cases has increased exponentially. On 12 November, the Directorate- General for Health of Portugal reported a total of 302 cases of Legionnaires' disease. So far, 5 deaths have been confirmed to be caused by the disease. Four more deaths are currently being investigated. All cases have epidemiological links to the outbreak taking place in Vila Franca de Xira. This is the biggest Legionella disease outbreak detected in Portugal, and it is evolving rapidly; therefore, the outbreak is considered to be a major public health emergency. At present, the regional outbreak investigation team is in place and it is supported by a larger national team of experts in epidemiology, clinical, microbiology and environmental health, with other stakeholders from the municipality following the epidemiological situation and undertaking environmental investigations. ### Precautionary measures As precautionary measures, ornamental fountains in the outbreak area have been closed, and the chlorine concentration of tap water has been increased. Cooling towers of the main industrial facilities in the affected area have been closed down. The Directorate-General for Health of Portugal has issued the following precautionary recommendations to the population, until the source of the outbreak has been identified and eliminated: * to avoid showers, Jacuzzis and whirlpools; * to disinfect shower heads by immersion in bleach solutions for about 30 minutes once a week, * to set the temperature on water heaters above 75ºC, if possible. The Directorate-General for Health is liaising with the national agencies for health, environment and meteorology. It is also maintaining close communication and collaboration with partners in the European Union – especially, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) – and with the World Health Organization.

"(' On 4 November 2014, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar of an outbreak of plague. The first case, a male from Soamahatamana village in the district of Tsiroanomandidy, was identified on 31 August. The patient died on 3 September. As of 16 November, a total of 119 cases of plague have been confirmed, including 40 deaths. Only 2% of reported cases are of the pneumonic form. Cases have been reported in 16 districts of seven regions. Antananarivo, the capital and largest city in Madagascar, has also been affected with 2 recorded cases of plague, including 1 death. There is now a risk of a rapid spread of the disease due to the city’s high population density and the weakness of the healthcare system. The situation is further complicated by the high level of resistance to deltamethrin (an insecticide used to control fleas) that has been observed in the country. ### Public health response The national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners – including WHO, the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, the “Commune urbaine d’Antananarivo” and the Red Cross – the government of Madagascar has put in place effective strategies to control the outbreak. Thanks to financial assistance from the African Development Bank, a 200,000 US dollars response project has been developed. WHO is providing technical expertise and human resources support. Measures for the control and prevention of plague are being thoroughly implemented in the affected districts. Personal protective equipment, insecticides, spray materials and antibiotics have been made available in those areas. ### Background Plague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high. ### WHO recommendations WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities. ',)",119
"(' On 29 December 2014, WHO was notified by the National IHR Focal Point for the United Kingdom of a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).

The patient flew from Freetown to Rome via Casablanca, Morocco on 7May. The arrival of the case had been communicated to the Ministry of Health, according to the health surveillance procedures in force since October 2014 for individuals coming back from Ebola affected countries in West Africa. At the arrival in Rome, the case displayed no symptoms of infectious Ebola. On 10 May, 72 hours after his return to Italy, the patient developed symptoms. The patient self-isolated at home and was transported on 11 May to the infectious diseases ward of the Hospital of Sassari, Sardinia. Clinical samples have been tested by the national reference centre of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) Lazzaro Spallanzani of Rome on 12 May, confirming EVD infection. The patient was transferred from the Hospital of Sassari to the INMI of Rome with the specially equipped aircraft of the Italian Air Force, to assure high- containment precautions. Since the onset of symptoms occurred 72 hours after the last flight, contact tracing of the passengers of the flights is not considered necessary.

He was transferred to another hospital for isolation on 2 June. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases. The National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case. The case was reported in a previous DON on 30 May (case n. 3). So far, a total of 41 MERS-CoV cases, including 4 deaths, have been reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea. One of the 41 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China. Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1190 laboratory- confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 444 related deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. ',)",41
"(' The Ministry of Health of Madagascar has notified WHO of an outbreak of plague. The first case was identified on 17 August in a rural township in Moramanga district. The case passed away on 19 August. As of 30 August, 14 cases, including 10 deaths, were reported. All confirmed cases are of the pneumonic form. Since 27 August, no new cases have been reported from the affected or neighbouring districts. ### Public health response The national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners – including WHO and the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar – the government of Madagascar is implementing thorough public health measures, including active case and contact finding, provision of chemoprophylaxis, case and contact management, enhanced epidemiologic surveillance, infection prevention and control (house disinfection), vector control activities, social mobilization, coordination and resource mobilization. ### WHO risk assessment WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities. ### Background Plague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high. The current outbreak follows another plague outbreak that occurred in Madagascar between 2014 and 2015, with a peak in November 2014 when over 335 cases and 79 deaths were reported. ',)",14
"(' The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Tanzania has notified WHO of foci of cholera outbreaks in the country. Rorya district in the Mara region of Tanzania was the first area to report a cholera outbreak. By late July 2015, the Kigoma region also became affected – although no new case has been recorded in this area in more than three weeks. On 25 August, new foci of cholera were identified in Dar es Salaam, Pwani (Coast), Iringa and Morogoro. The cholera outbreak in the Dar es Salaam region began on 15 August, whilst the outbreak in the Morogoro region started on 18 August. As of 6 September, the cumulative number of cholera cases (both suspected and confirmed) is 971 cases, including 13 deaths. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa in the affected areas. ### Public health response Rapid assessment has been conducted to identify gaps and urgent needs. Regional authorities, the MOHSW, WHO and partners are holding bi-weekly meetings to coordinate the response efforts. A national task force has been activated to control the outbreak. With support from WHO and partners, five treatment centres have been established in Dar es Salaam and Morogoro to manage cases. The MOHSW has deployed technical experts to provide assistance with surveillance activities including case finding, water supply and sanitation monitoring, laboratory management and social mobilization interventions. ### WHO risk assessment WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Tanzania based on the current information available. ### Background Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. Cholera outbreaks are recurrent in many African countries and are linked to poor hygiene and sanitation as well as insufficient preparedness and capacities. Tanzania has experienced cholera outbreaks in the past, with the Kigoma region being the most affected. This year, the country developed a long-term plan for cholera prevention and control. Cholera is predictable and preventable, and can ultimately be eliminated where access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and satisfactory hygienic conditions are ensured and sustained for the whole population. Effective cholera prevention and control interventions rely primarily on the implementation of integrated multidisciplinary and comprehensive approaches that involve activities outside the health sector and that address several elements, including environmental living conditions, access to treatment and clinical management of cases, vaccination with Oral Cholera Vaccines, social mobilization of communities and epidemiological surveillance.

Between 1 and 31 October 2015, a total of 253 cases were admitted to the Dayrout Fever Hospital due to acute febrile illness. Patients developed fever, headache, general body aches and abdominal pain with occasional vomiting and/or diarrhea but experienced no further complications or fatalities. They have been responding to the given medical care. Some of the cases come from the same household. Several samples including oropharyngeal swabs, blood and serum samples were collected. A total of 28 out of the 118 serum samples were positive for Dengue virus type I by ELISA and PCR at the Central Public Health Laboratories. For further confirmation, samples were sent to the Naval Medical Research Unit Three (NAMRU-3) laboratory and tested positive for Dengue virus type I by ELISA and PCR. ### Public health response A national team of experts comprising field epidemiologists, entomologists, sanitation and laboratory personnel visited the affected village to carry out the necessary investigations. In response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Public Health has developed a case definition of the disease and widely disseminated it to physicians in the Daiyrout District. A training workshop was conducted for all health care workers to enhance their capacity for the early detection and prompt management of cases. Surveillance is ongoing in the surrounding villages and districts for early detection of cases. Entomological surveillance revealed the presence of Aedes aegypti larvae and adult mosquito at the sites where cases are living; consequently, entomological control measures for dengue vector were immediately set up. So far, these measures have resulted in a dramatic decline in the density of adult mosquito (from 23% to 0%) and larvae (from 25% to 0.5%). Entomological surveillance and vector control measures continue to be implemented in the affected villages and its surrounding areas. ',)",253

The case is a 27-year-old female from Berbice, Region 6, with onset of symptoms on 1 January. Samples of the patient were collected on 4 January and sent to the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) laboratory in Trinidad and Tobago for testing. The case was confirmed by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) (viral genome detection). ### Barbados On 15 January, the NFP for Barbados reported the first 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of locally-acquired Zika virus infection in the country. None of the cases had a history of travel. Samples of the patients were sent to the CARPHA laboratory for testing. The cases were confirmed by PCR (viral genome detection). ### Ecuador On 15 January, the NFP for Ecuador reported 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of locally-acquired Zika virus infection in the country. As of 16 January, a total number of 6 cases had been reported – 2 of the cases were locally- acquired while the remaining 4 cases were imported (3 from Colombia and 1 from Venezuela). Samples from all cases were collected and sent to the National Public Health and Research Institute in Guayaquil for laboratory testing. All cases tested positive by PCR (viral genome detection) for Zika virus and negative for dengue and chikungunya. ### Public health response Health authorities in Guyana, Barbados and Ecuador are taking the following measures: * intensifying surveillance activities, * implementing vector control measures, * educating the public about the risks associated with Zika virus and encouraging them to take every precaution against mosquito bites. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.

The potential cause of the reported increase of GBS incidence in certain Brazilian states remains unknown. Case-control studies are ongoing to determine the cause of the increase. These studies may provide evidence that corroborates or disproves a causal relationship between Zika virus, GBS and other congenital malformations. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO recommends Member States affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks to: * monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values; * develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome; * raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection.

The outbreak was initially detected on 21 January following reports of unexplained fever within a cluster of health workers from the district of Tchaourou, Borgou department. On 3 January, these health workers provided care to a patient suffering from haemorrhagic fever. Between 21 January and 16 February, 71 cases (6 confirmed, 10 probable et 55 suspected) were reported from seven departments – namely, Borgou (52), Collines (13), Ouémé (2), Alibori (1), Atlantique (1), Kouffo (1) and Littoral (1). During the same period of time, a total of 23 deaths were recorded in the departments of Borgou (16), Collines (4), Atlantique (1), Ouémé (1) and Plateau. Seven of the reported cases (3 confirmed, 1 probable and 3 suspected), including 2 deaths (1 confirmed and 1 probable), were health workers. To date, 6 cases, including 2 deaths, have been laboratory confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Virology Unit, Central Research Laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health of Benin, with the support of WHO and partners, is coordinating the management of the outbreak. Control measures are being implemented, including field investigation, enhanced surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and follow-up, and social mobilization. WHO has deployed a multidisciplinary team in the affected areas to support the response. WHO's Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) has deployed two experts and has provided financial support to the country. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 318 contacts have been identified and 292 are currently under follow-up. ### WHO risk assessment Lassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries. The disease causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of Benin, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. Although, this is only the second Lassa outbreak reported in Benin, the outbreak is occurring during known seasonal patterns. According to available information, its characteristics are similar to other outbreaks described elsewhere; however, considering seasonal case flare-ups during this time of the year, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems. WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available. ### Background Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness with an incubation period of 1-4 weeks and is endemic in West Africa. The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevent and control measures. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin (where it was diagnosed for the first time in November 2014), Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%. Observed case-fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa fever is 15%. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. "",)",71

Aruba is an autonomous, self-governing constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while Bonaire is a special municipality of the Netherlands. ### Bonaire On 15 February, the National IHR Focal Point (IHR NFP) for the Netherlands reported one case of Zika virus infection in Bonaire. The case was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 12 February. ### Aruba On 16 February, IHR NFP for the Netherlands notified WHO of the first four autochthonous cases of Zika virus on the island of Aruba. The cases include three resident islanders and a tourist. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR on 15 February. An additional seven cases of Zika virus infection have been identified in Aruba. These reported cases acquired the infection in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. In the continental part of the Netherlands, to date, 24 imported cases of Zika virus infection have been confirmed. All patients were diagnosed following a visit to Suriname or Aruba. All diagnoses were made by RT-PCR. ### Public health response Control measures have been implemented by local public health authorities in accordance with WHO guidelines in both Bonaire and Aruba. Because of this imminent epidemic, during the past months, local authorities have intensified mosquito control programs. ### WHO risk assessment The detection of autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection indicates that the virus is spreading geographically to previously unaffected areas (Bonaire and Aruba). The notification of autochthonous transmission in a new country does not change the overall risk assessment. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Despite some reports of a potential association between Zika virus, microcephaly and other neurological disorders, at this stage, it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between these events. Until more is understood, Members States are advised to standardize and enhance surveillance for microcephaly and other neurological disorders, particularly in areas of known Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such transmission. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to countries or territories within the Kingdom of the Netherlands based on the current information available. ',)",11
"(' On 24 November 2015, health authorities in French Polynesia reported unknown and unspecified causes of morbidity and mortality in the context of concomitant outbreaks of Zika and dengue (serotypes 1 and 3) viruses. This update provides additional information on the clinical findings as well as the epidemiological and laboratory investigations of these cases. Between October 2013 and April 2014, French Polynesia experienced the largest Zika virus outbreak ever recorded in the country. During this period of time, 32,000 patients (11.5% of the population) were assessed for the infection and 8,750 suspected cases were reported by the national surveillance system. Of the suspected cases, 383 were later laboratory-confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). During the Zika virus outbreak, 42 patients were admitted to hospital with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This represents a 20-fold increase in incidence of GBS in French Polynesia compared with the previous four years. Of the 42 patients, 16 (38%) required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 12 (29%) received mechanical ventilation. The duration of hospital stay for patients that were not admitted to ICU ranged between 7 to 20 days (median=11). The duration of hospital stay for patients that were admitted to intensive care went from 16 to 70 days (median=51). No deaths were reported. The majority of these cases (88%) reported symptomatic Zika virus infection in the days (median=6) that preceded the onset of neurological symptoms. Further investigations were carried out to identify the potential role of previous infections known to be associated, or potentially associated, with GBS. The investigations carried out by the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire- Direction de la Santé de Polynésie Française showed that 41 of the 42 cases of GBS (98%) had IgM or IgG antibodies against Zika virus; furthermore, all GBS cases (100%) had positive seroneutralisation against Zika virus. Results for the matched non-febrile illness control group were significantly different: elevated IgM or IgG antibodies were detected in 35 of the 98 control patients (36%); additionally, neutralising antibodies against Zika virus were detected in 54 control patients (56%). Analysis of dengue serology (immunofluorescent assay, microsphere immunoassay, and seroneutralisation) did not support recent dengue infection, even though most cases (95%) had pre-existing dengue immunity. Other known causes of GBS were investigated and excluded, including Campylobacter jejuni, Cytomegalovirus, HIV, Epstein–Barr and Herpes simplex viruses. ### WHO risk assessment This is the first report of a large number of patients who developed GBS after contracting Zika virus. The study provides strong evidence of a possible causal relationship between Zika virus infection and GBS. Since all 42 cases had serological tests suggesting successive dengue and Zika virus infections, this association might be a predisposing factor for developing GBS. Further investigations are needed to understand the implications of pre-existing dengue infections, together with recent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis of GBS. Similarly to French Polynesia, it is likely that countries that are currently reporting autochthonous Zika virus transmission will face a rise in the number of GBS cases in the coming months. A number of countries in Latin America have already started to report an increase in the incidence of GBS while experiencing a rise in the cases of Zika virus infection. Nevertheless, it is critical to ensure that in all these countries, the reported increases in the incidence of GBS are the result of a real change rather than enhanced surveillance. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO recommends Member States affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks to: * monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values; * develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome; * raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors.

"(' On 10 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of 2 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with confirmed Zika virus infection. Both cases are under investigation to determine whether they meet the Brighton Collaboration case definition for GBS. ### Details of the cases * The first case is an elderly male resident of the United States with recent travel to Central America. He developed an acute febrile illness shortly after returning to the U.S. and was subsequently hospitalized in January with progressive ascending weakness of the extremities and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He improved following treatment and was ready to be discharged. However, he experienced a sudden subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm and died. * The second case is an adult male resident of Haiti who experienced an acute onset of facial weakness, difficulty swallowing, and numbness of fingers in early January. No antecedent illness was reported. A few days later, he travelled to the United States for additional medical care. Cerebrospinal fluid had elevated protein and normal white blood cells. Physical examination showed mild weakness and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by serology. He improved with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and was discharged. ### WHO risk assessment To date, a total of 9 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of GBS and/or laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection among GBS cases. This is the first time that a country with no vector borne transmission of Zika virus detects patients with concomitant GBS and Zika virus infection. These cases provide additional evidence of a possible causal relationship between Zika virus and GBS. Further investigations are needed to understand the implications of pre-existing dengue infections, together with recent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis of GBS. It is likely that countries that are currently reporting autochthonous Zika virus transmission will face a rise in the number of GBS cases in the coming months.

"(' On 21 March, the Ministry of Health of Angola provided WHO with an update on the ongoing outbreak of yellow fever (YF), which started on 5 December 2015 in the Viana municipality, Luanda province. As of 21 March, 16 of the country’s 18 provinces have reported YF suspected cases – 13 of these provinces have reported imported cases linked to Luanda. Local transmission of the disease was documented in 2 of the 11 municipalities of Huambo province. Other provinces have reported autochthonous suspected cases with no epidemiological links to Luanda. These cases are being investigated and outcomes of these investigations will be known in the following days. To date, at least 1,132 suspected and confirmed cases have been reported nationally, including 168 deaths. A total of 375 cases have been laboratory- confirmed. Luanda, the outbreak epicentre, remains the main affected province with 818 cases (281 confirmed confirmed), including 129 deaths. However, the number of cases reported in provinces other than Luanda is apparently increasing. ### Public health response A national task force was activated and is now leading the response to the outbreak. WHO is providing support for the coordination of the response operations. On 12 February, WHO declared this outbreak a “grade 2 emergency”, in accordance with the Emergency Response Framework (ERF). Since then, 65 WHO multidisciplinary experts have been deployed to provide high-level technical support to the country. The Immunization campaign in Luanda, which started on 2 February in Viana, is still ongoing and has so far been implemented in 6 municipalities out of the targeted 12. Three municipalities are reporting high coverage rates (≥90%) while other municipalities are reporting even higher rates (136% in Viana and 113% in Bela) probably due to people coming from other districts of Luanda as well as other provinces. Surveillance and investigations of newly affected areas are ongoing as well as social mobilization activities. So far, vector control activities are mainly oriented to the control of the mosquito breeding sites. ### WHO risk assessment The evolution of the situation in Angola is concerning and needs to be closely monitored in the whole African region. Partly, the reported drastic increase in the number of confirmed cases could be attributed to backlog testing. However, the dates of symptom onset of the recently-confirmed cases indicate that transmission is still active in Luanda – mainly in unimmunized districts and probably in other provinces. Surveillance is reportedly not optimal, especially in the border areas, and a higher number of suspected cases cannot be excluded. Of particular concern is the cross border and international spread risk of the disease, which has already been documented, with cases recently rumoured to have been exported to China, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information. It is important to know that imported cases do not represent an outbreak. Although the threat of an outbreak exists, this is considered to be low when the risk factors (susceptible vectors and susceptible human populations) are not present. ### WHO advice WHO urges Members States, especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is present), to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic epidemic areas. In the context of an active Yellow fever outbreak in Angola, special attention should also be placed on travellers returning from Angola and other potential epidemic areas. Travellers, particularly those arriving to Asia from Africa or Latin America must have a certificate of yellow fever vaccination. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, International Health Regulations state that this must be certified by the appropriate authorities. WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Angola on the basis of the information available on this outbreak. The vaccination of each person before going to the affected areas as well as measures to avoid mosquito bites are sufficient for the prevention of the disease. ',)",1132
"(' Between 15 and 18 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Kenya notified WHO of 2 imported cases of yellow fever (YF). Both cases are male Kenyan nationals, in their early 30s, working in Luanda, Angola. Both travelled while symptomatic and none were vaccinated against yellow fever prior to traveling to Angola. The first case developed symptoms on 8 March in Luanda and travelled to Kenya on 12 March. At his arrival, he was hospitalized in a private clinic in Nairobi and was later referred to another health care facility. The patient died after experiencing multi-organ failure. The second case presented symptoms on 1 March in Luanda, and flew back to Kenya on 7 March. He went to his home town (Namanga) on the Kenyan-Tanzanian Border. He returned to Nairobi to seek treatment on 11 March where he was hospitalised. The patient was treated and has since recovered and been discharged. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed on samples of both cases by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). RT-PCR was negative for the two cases; however, samples from both cases tested positive for anti-YF IgM antibody. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is currently being conducted. ### Public health response The Kenyan government has taken the following measures: * urging all county health departments and relevant stakeholders to enhance disease surveillance, in particular for yellow fever, at points of entry (PoEs) and within the country; * carrying out social mobilization activities; * activating a national task force to manage the detected imported cases; * strengthening the testing capability of the reference laboratory; * reactivating the viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) national task force to update VHF preparedness and early-response plans; * providing information to travellers on yellow fever vaccination and implementation of inspection of yellow fever certificates at PoEs. ### WHO risk assessment The risk of sustained local transmission is considered to be minimal since the density of the competent vector, the Aedes aegypti, in Nairobi is very low and none-of the two cases arrived in a viraemic state. However, it is important to highlight that yellow fever introduction represents a potential threat in areas of the country where the risk factors for yellow fever are present (human susceptibility, prevalence of the competent vector, animal reservoirs). The possibility of further international disease spread from Kenya to other countries is also considered to be low; nevertheless, the report of yellow fever infection in non-immunized travellers returning from a country where vaccination against the disease is mandatory underlines the need to reinforce the implementation of vaccination requirements, in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Kenya based on the current information available. ',)",2
"(' On 11 April 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of an outbreak caused by Elizabethkingia anophelis. From 1 November 2015 to 30 March 2016, a total of 57 cases were reported from Wisconsin (56) and Michigan (1), including 18 deaths. The majority of the cases had E. anophelis isolated from the bloodstream. Other cases had the bacterium isolated from other sites, including respiratory systems and joints. Most cases are over the age of 65 years and all have serious underlying health conditions. It has not yet been determined whether the deaths associated with this outbreak were caused by the bacterial infection, the patients’ comorbidities, or both. Many potential sources of the bacteria have been assessed, including water sources, health care facilities, medications and personal care products, though no common source has been identified to date. Investigations are ongoing. ### Public health response Health authorities in the United States are taking the following measures: * administering antibiotic treatment to those with E. anophelis infections, * providing information about infection control and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to all health care providers, infection prevention specialists and laboratories state-wide. ### WHO risk assessment Although Elizabethkingia anophelis is commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil and water, it rarely causes illness in humans. A few small, localized outbreaks were reported before, usually in healthcare settings. The current outbreak in the United States is the largest known outbreak of Elizabethkingia on record. Since the transmission route of the bacteria remains unknown and bacteria primarily infects people with serious underlying health conditions further cases can be expected. PAHO/WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice PAHO/WHO encourages national public health authorities to report any cluster of E. anophelis and the potential identified cause by using the established communication channels under the International Health Regulations (2005).

"(' On 20 April 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of an ongoing investigation of four multistate outbreaks of human Salmonella infections linked to exposure to small turtles (with shell length <4 inches/10 centimetres) or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat) in the United States. A total of 124 cases with the outbreak strains of Salmonella have been reported from 22 U.S. states. Of these, 33% of patients have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. Of the total, 51 cases (41%) were aged less than 5 years. The earliest illness associated with the four outbreaks began on 1 January 2015. Initial investigations have identified four turtle farms in Louisiana as potential sources of the turtles linked to these 2015 outbreaks. Pond water testing from the four farms resulted in the identification of additional non-outbreak Salmonella isolates. ### Public health response The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating these outbreaks and the identified turtle farms which may have exported turtles with Salmonella internationally. Results of the epidemiologic, laboratory and environmental investigations indicate exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat) as the sources of these outbreaks. ### WHO risk assessment Despite the sale and distribution of small turtles in the United States has been banned since 1975, Salmonella outbreaks linked to pet turtles have been recorded in the United States. Turtles are a known cause of human Salmonella infections in the United States, particularly in infants and young children - in this outbreak most illnesses are infants and young children. Since the infection is linked to exposure to small turtles that have been exported internationally, there is a risk to paediatric populations in other countries. The risk of morbidity and mortality is higher in patients with severe immunosuppression. PAHO/WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice Countries that import reptile or amphibian pets, including small turtles, should pay attention to potential imports of infected pets, and inform local health authorities to consider exposure to small turtles and other reptile or amphibian pets when investigating cases or potential outbreaks of salmonellosis, especially in the pediatric population. * * * ##### CORRIGENDUM Please note that the WHO advice section above has been edited to highlight surveillance for human illnesses and outbreaks linked to reptile or amphibian pets.

He was admitted to hospital for treatment on 12 April and is currently in critical condition. The patient’s clinical sample was confirmed to be A(H5N6) virus nucleic acid positive by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) on 21 April. He had exposure to a live poultry market before symptom onset.

The patient’s clinical sample was confirmed to be A(H5N6) virus nucleic acid positive by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) on 24 April. She was exposed to live poultry before onset of the disease. Close contacts of the patient remain healthy. ### Public health response The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: * strengthening surveillance, analysis and research; * further enhancing the medical care of the case; * conducting public risk communication and releasing information. ### WHO risk assessment This report does not change the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses. Although influenza A(H5N6) has caused severe infection in humans, until now human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human to human transmission and close contacts of the case remain healthy. However, the characterization of this virus is ongoing and its implication to the evolution and emergence of a pandemic strain is unknown. The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time.

"(' Since 1 January 2016, WHO has been notified of at least 38 suspected cases of Lassa fever in Liberia. Suspected cases were reported from 6 prefectures: Bong (17 cases, including 9 deaths), Nimba (14 cases, including 6 deaths), Gbarpolu (4 cases), Lofa (1 case), Margibi (1 case) and Montserrado (1 case). Between 1 January and 3 April 2016, samples from 24 suspected cases were received for laboratory testing. Of these 24 suspected cases, 7 are reported to have tested positive for Lassa fever: * 2 cases were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); * 2 cases were identified through the detection of IgM antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); * 2 cases were identified through the detection of Lassa virus antigens using ELISA; * information on the type of testing employed to identify the seventh case is not currently available. All the Lassa fever confirmed cases tested negative for Ebola virus disease. Since there are no designated laboratories in Liberia that can test samples for Lassa fever by PCR, specimens are currently sent for testing to Kenema, Sierra Leone. ### Public health response To date, 134 contacts have completed the 21-day follow-up period. A total of 17 additional contacts are being monitored. None of these contacts have so far developed symptoms. Appropriate outbreak response measures, including case management, infection prevention and control, community engagement and health education, have been put in place by the national authorities with the support of WHO and partner organizations. ### WHO risk assessment Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the country. Based on experiences from previous similar events, it is expected that additional cases will be reported. Although occasional travel-associated cases of Lassa fever have been reported in the past (see DON published on 27 and 8 April 2016), the risk of disease spread from Liberia to non-endemic countries is considered to be low. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice Considering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures). Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions. The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Liberia based on the current information available. ',)",38
"(' Between August 2015 and 17 May 2016, WHO has been notified of 273 cases of Lassa fever, including 149 deaths in Nigeria. Of these, 165 cases and 89 deaths have been confirmed through laboratory testing (CFR: 53.9%). The cases were reported from 23 states in Nigeria. Since August 2015, ten health care workers (HCW) have been infected with Lassa fever virus, of which two have died. Of these ten cases, four were nosocomial infections. As of 17 May 2016, 8 states are currently reporting Lassa fever cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed), deaths and/or following of contacts for the maximum 21-day incubation period. Currently, 248 contacts are being followed up in the country. The other 15 previously affected states have completed the 42-day period following last known possible transmission. ### Public health response Currently, two national laboratories are supporting the laboratory confirmation of Lassa fever cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. All the samples were also tested for Ebola, Dengue, Yellow fever and so far have tested negative. The two laboratories that are currently operational are: * Virology laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital * Lassa fever research and control centre, Irrua specialist hospital Along with other key partners, WHO is supporting ministry of health in surveillance and response of Lassa fever outbreaks including contacts tracing, follow up and community mobilization. One of a concern since the onset of Lassa fever outbreaks is the high proportion of deaths among the cases that is still under investigation. ### WHO Risk Assessment Overall, the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend. Considering the seasonal peaks in previous years, improvements in community and health care worker awareness, preparedness and general response activities, the risk of a larger-scale outbreak is low. Nevertheless, close monitoring, active case search, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (both in community in general and specific training for health care workers) should continue. ### WHO Advice Considering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding.

To date, there have been no fatalities and all cases have recovered following symptomatic treatment. In February 2016, a field mission to the Madre de Dios Region conducted jointly by the MoH of Peru and PAHO/WHO revealed a mixed outbreak of dengue (DENV-2) and Oropouche viruses. While Madre de Dios already experienced an outbreak of Oropouche fever in 1994, at the time of the mission in February, this latest outbreak was of a higher magnitude (120 confirmed cases). ### Public health response Peruvian health authorities have implemented the following public health measures: * providing medical treatment to the cases; * conducting epidemiological and entomological investigations; * strengthening vector control. ### WHO risk assessment Cases of infection with Oropouche virus have already been reported in the past in Peru. However, it is the first time that the Cusco Region records cases of Oropouche fever. It will be critical to establish whether the competent vector, the Culicoides paraensis midge, is present in Cusco as that could provide some explanation for the emergence of the disease in this specific area. At present, the possibility of further cases being detected in the Cusco Region and in the rest of Peru cannot be excluded. Given the wide geographical distribution of the competent vector in the Region of the Americas, the risk of cases being identified in other countries is significant. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice Given its clinical presentation, Oropouche fever should be included in the clinical differential diagnosis for other common arboviral diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Zika virus). The proximity of midge vector breeding to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Oropouche virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of midges through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between midges and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support midge larvae, reducing the adult midge populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. ### Background Oropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus. In humans, it is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. No direct transmission of the virus from human to human has been documented. Oropouche fever causes symptoms similar to those of dengue with an incubation period of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting. In some patients it can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis. In the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche fever virus have been reported from rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago. ',)",57
"(' On 25 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Benin notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever (see DON published on 19 February). On 23 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Benin declared the end of the outbreak. The announcement came 42 days after the detection of the last Lassa fever case in the country (10 April 2016). A total of 54 suspected cases, including 28 deaths, were reported from eight regions: Borgou (31 cases, 16 deaths), Donga (7 cases, 5 deaths), Collines (6 cases, 3 deaths), Alibori (3 cases, 1 death), Plateau (3 cases, 2 deaths), Ouémé (2 cases, 1 death), Atlantique (1 case) and Littoral (1 case). Of these 54 suspected cases, 16 were laboratory-confirmed in three regions: Borgou (13 cases), Donga (2 cases), Ouémé (1 case). Five of the 54 suspected cases are health workers from the Borgou region. Three of these 5 health workers were laboratory-confirmed. Two of these 5 health workers passed away. During the course of this outbreak, five laboratories provided technical support for the confirmation of Lassa fever cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR): * Lassa Fever Research and Control Centre, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua, Edo state, Nigeria; * Virology laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital Lagos, Nigeria; * Tropical medicine institute laboratory, Hamburg, Germany; * Noguchi laboratory (WHO Collaborating centre), Ghana; * Institut Pasteur (IP) Lyon, France. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health of Benin, with the support of WHO and partners, coordinated the management of the outbreak. Control measures were implemented, including field investigation, enhanced surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and follow-up, and social mobilization. WHO deployed a multidisciplinary team in the affected areas to support the response. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 739 contacts were identified and monitored. At present, 1 contact under follow-up was laboratory confirmed for Lassa fever infection. ### WHO risk assessment The current report confirms that, at present, there are no known Lassa fever transmission chains in Benin. Although Lassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries, this is only the second time that cases were reported in Benin (the first outbreak occurred in November 2014). This latest outbreak was characterized by a high number of deaths among confirmed cases. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to investigate the factors that contributed to this higher than expected mortality rate. Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood of flare-ups, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems. ### WHO advice WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available.

"(' On 2 June 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of the first laboratory-confirmed case of locally-acquired Chikungunya virus in the state of Texas. The patient, who is from Cameron County, became ill in November 2015 and tested positive for the Chikungunya virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in January 2016. The diagnosis was confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in May 2016. Unlike previously reported cases of Chikungunya virus among Texas residents, the patient had no recent history of travel. However, since the patient contracted the infection more than six months ago and the entomological investigations confirm the absence of chikungunya virus in local mosquitoes, the primary risk of infection for the USA at this time remains travel-related. ### Public health response To prevent the establishment of local transmission of CHIKV in Texas, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), in consultation with the U.S. CDC recommends the following actions, as time and resources allow, when a person known or suspected of having a Chikungunya virus infection is present in Texas: * vector control, * mosquito surveillance and testing, * education. ### WHO risk assessment This is the second time that autochthonous circulation of chikungunya virus is reported in the United States: autochthonous circulation of chikungunya virus was first reported in the state of Florida in July 2014 (12 cases). The risk of large-scale outbreaks of Chikungunya virus in the United States is considered to be low. Nevertheless, given the presence of the competent vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) in different areas of the United States as well as the occasional reporting of cases among incoming travellers, the possibility of the establishment of autochthonous cycles of transmission cannot be completely ruled out. Furthermore, there is a risk of extension of disease transmission to other countries where the competent vectors are present. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Source reduction with active community support should be encouraged. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to the United States of America based on the current information available. ',)",1
"("" On 1 July 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the United Kingdom notified WHO of an outbreak of Enterohaemorrhagic Shiga toxin-producing Escherischia coli (STEC) O157 PT34 in England and Wales. The increase in the notifications of E. coli O157 cases was first observed by the South West Public Health England (PHE) Centre on 21 June. An outbreak control team was convened on 22 June to investigate this increase and, on 24 June, the first samples associated with this increase were confirmed as STEC serogroup O157 phage type 34, positive for the eae (intimin) and verocytotoxin 2 genes but negative for the verocytotoxin 1 gene (hereafter referred to as 'the outbreak strain'). On 27 June, a significant increase in the number of cases with the outbreak strain was observed nationally, and the incident was declared and managed as a national outbreak. Analysis of whole genome sequencing data confirmed that the isolates fall within the same cluster. The outbreak strain is not related to strains currently circulating amongst the UK bovine reservoir but rather closely related to sequences identified in people reporting recent travel to the Mediterranean region. This suggests that the outbreak strain is likely to be imported. As of 14 July, 158 cases had been identified, of which 105 had been classified as confirmed cases and 53 as probable. Four of these patients remain in hospital. Features of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) have been reported in seven cases. Two cases have died, both of whom have E. coli infection listed as a causative factor. Cases are distributed throughout the UK, with the majority (91%) residing in England. The outbreak is characterised by multiple small clusters linked to catering and residential care premises. The proportion of hospitalised cases is high (40%). Cases are predominantly female (75%) and over the age of 18 (91%) – the age range is between 1 and 98 years. Onset dates for cases range from 31 May 2016 to 5 July 2016. Multiple analytical studies have provided evidence that consumption of mixed salad leaves, particularly from catering establishments such as cafes and restaurants, is associated with the infection. Sampling and microbiological examination of salad products is continuing although all results to date have been negative for STEC O157. ### Public health response Control measures have been implemented by a small number of wholesalers to cease adding some imported leaves to their mixed salad products pending further investigations. PHE is working with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Food Standards Agency and the European Commission to identify the source of the outbreak. PHE is also providing advice to the public and keeping them informed about the ongoing investigations. ### WHO risk assessment The outbreak was confirmed to have been caused by a particular strain of Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) O157 Phage type 34, although the source of the infection is yet to be identified. Even though Phage type 34 is the seventh most common phage type amongst STEC O157 isolates, with 734 cases detected between 1994 and 2016, on average not more than one case is reported per week, rising to 2.35 cases per week during spring and summer; therefore, the observed increase is significant. Similar increases have not been reported from other European countries and the same strain has not been reported outside of the United Kingdom indicating that, at present, the outbreak could be restricted to the UK. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### Backgound Escherischia coli (E. coli) is a bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. Most strains of E. coli are harmless; however, some strains, such as enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, can cause severe foodborne disease. "",)",158
"(' On 28 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Kenya notified WHO of an outbreak of Chikungunya in Mandera East sub-county. The first reports of an increase in cases with febrile illness and joint pains occurred in May 2016. Samples were collected and shipped to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Arboviral Laboratory in Nairobi. On 16 May, KEMRI laboratory confirmed 7 of the 10 samples tested positive for Chikungunya virus. All samples tested negative for other arboviruses including: dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. Moreover, from partial sequencing of the envelope gene it was observed that the CHIK isolates from Mandera are grouped with isolates from the post-2005 Indian Ocean islands, Asia and Europe. Full genome sequencing is underway. To date, KEMRI has received a total of 177 samples of suspected cases in the laboratory for testing. Of thse, 53 of these came from Somalia and rest from Mandera. 57 were positive by IgM antibody testing and 38 were positive for CHIK virus by RT-PCR. Of the positives, 9 were both IgM and PCR positive. As of 30 June 2016, 1,792 cases had been line listed. No deaths have been reported so far. However there is a risk of underreporting of cases since many patients are not reporting to health facilities. There have been outbreaks of Chikungunya in neighbouring Bula Hawa region in Somalia border region originating from Mogadishu. It is estimated that about 80% of the population and 50% of the health work force in Mandera town were affected by Chikungunya. Cases with severe debilitating joint pains were being managed as inpatients for a short duration for 1 or 2 days. However, the majority of the cases are not seeking treatment in health facilities. ### Public health response WHO country office supported the Ministry of Health to dispatch seven technical staff to support the County government of Mandera in risk assessment. WHO supported a rapid vector assessment survey, it was observed that most of the breeding habitats for the Aedes vectors for chikungunya in Mandera are within domiciliary containers mainly for water storage. The density of day-biting Aedes vectors were substantially high and County vector control activities were minimal. A cross border and coordination meeting between Somalia and Kenya took place on 30 May 2016 to coordinate joint response activities to control the outbreak. The meeting recommended a lead agency to coordinate response activities across the border and to improve coordinated surveillance and information sharing. Other partners who were part of the response included MSF and Kenya Red cross. MSF supplied 30,000 treated mosquito nets, which targeted about 30% coverage for the population at risk. The MOH also provided 5000 ITNs for hospital use and chemicals for vector control. The last outbreak of Chikungunya in Kenya was in 2004 and 2005, where at least 1,300 cases were documented. The affected areas were Lamu and Mombasa in the Coast region. A seroprevalence survey done in October 2004 suggested that 75% of the population in Lamu had been affected. ### WHO risk assessment In the past, the outbreak that began in 2004, on the Kenyan coast reached the Comoros at the end of 2004 before spreading to the Indian Ocean islands in 2005. A mutation in the E1 gene and selection chikungunya virus strains that increase adaptation of the virus to one of the vector Aedes albopictus and therefore significantly increase transmissibility has likely occurred in Reunion Island at the end of 2005 and resulted in an unprecedented outbreak and a further spread to the rest of the world. If confirmed the preliminary sequencing results the circulation of the mutated chikungunya stain could yield significantly higher attack rate than with the formerly circulating African strain. Ae albopictus is an invasive species that continues to expand geographically in various parts of the world, could therefore represent a further risk of geographical extension the current outbreak in the affected countries and beyond . The risk for a moderate to high scale outbreak of Chikungunya in the area cannot be ruled out due to the presence of the disease vector, immunologically naive population and potential upcoming rains in the area. Besides potential cross border span of the outbreak, under-reporting of cases and low levels of health seeking behaviours among the affected population is concerning. ',)",1792
"(' On 6 September 2016, the Ministry of Health staff from Haute-Kotto health district alerted the central level of suspected monkeypox cases admitted at Ira Banda health centre. The index case was a hunter who fell ill on 17 August and died in his village without specimens being collected for laboratory testing. Between 4 September and 7 October, 26 cases have been admitted and of these, three have been laboratory confirmed for monkeypox. Epidemiological investigations are currently on-going to evaluate the magnitude of the outbreak. ### Public health response The Central African Republic MoH in collaboration with WHO Country Office is currently conducting response measures including: * Strengthening public health surveillance for possible cases. * Training healthcare workers on using personal protective equipment, and advocating proper hand hygiene and cleaning procedures in the health care setting. * Installing two isolation units for case management. * Provision of free care for patients affected with monkeypox. * Increasing public awareness to take precautionary measure to prevent monkeypox transmission. * Engaging International Medical Corps and the Catholic Organisation for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) to support case management and prevention measures. ### WHO risk assessment Small scale monkeypox outbreaks regularly occur in tropical Africa. Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans through contact with an infected animal or through infected animal bites. Person-to-person transmission can also occur during outbreaks through close contact with patients but there is no evidence to date that person-to-person transmission alone can sustain monkeypox transmission in humans. Given the lack of adequately equipped isolation units in healthcare facilities in the area and the known transmission dynamics of monkeypox between humans, the WHO encourages individuals and healthcare workers to follow infection prevention and control procedures when caring for patients, to prevent transmission of disease. Given the location of the outbreak in a relatively remote and sparsely populated area at this stage the risk of international spread seems limited. The WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel and trade to Central African Republic based on available information at this point in time. ',)",26
"(' In Pakistan, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected from environmental samples in Quetta, Balochistan. Two isolates with apparent genetic linkages were isolated from environmental samples, collected on 20 October and 28 November 2016. Virus was isolated from environmental samples only and no associated cases of paralysis linked to the isolated strains have been detected in Quetta or anywhere else in the province. Pakistan also continues to be affected by endemic transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). As of 21 December, 19 WPV1 cases have been reported in 2016. It is the lowest number of annual cases ever reported, from the fewest number of affected areas in the country. The majority of the polio cases during the last six months were reported from non-reservoir areas, i.e. from ‘tier 2, 3 and 4’ districts (districts which are considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection). There have been no paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in Pakistan since February 2016. ### Public health response A response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in the Quetta and neighbouring districts is now planned, in line with internationally-agreed protocols. The first campaign of a series of campaigns is planned for 2 January 2017. In addition, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoHSRC), supported by World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other partners, is further strengthening active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and conducting an in-depth field investigation to more clearly ascertain the circulation of this strain. Pakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, to urgently interrupt all remaining strains of polio transmission in the country. The area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational common reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting WPV1 transmission in this area remains the top most priority of the federal, provincial and district health teams. Meticulous preparations are underway through the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and District Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of upcoming back- to-back national and sub-national vaccination rounds, in December 2016, January 2017 and February 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). These campaigns are critical to addressing the remaining pockets of under-immunized populations sustaining low-intensity WPV1 transmission within the common reservoir. To ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate resources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified reasons for missed children; validating vaccination teams’ microplans, vaccinator selection, training and supervision; and enhancing local engagement with communities through community leaders. In order to jointly address transmission across the common reservoir, close coordination is ongoing with Afghanistan teams at all levels. ### WHO risk assessment WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common reservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical spread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with Afghanistan). WHO also assesses the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the common reservoir as medium to high. Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to other countries is assessed low. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission is subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure. ',)",0
"(' On 6 December 2016, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Madagascar alerted WHO of a suspected plague outbreak in Befotaka district, Atsimo Atsinanana region in the south-eastern part of the country. The district is outside the area known to be endemic area in Madagascar. No plague cases have been reported in this area since 1950. As of 27 December 2016, 62 cases (6 confirmed, 5 probable, 51 suspected) including 26 deaths (case fatality rate of 42%) have been reported in two adjacent districts in two neighbouring regions of the country. 28 cases, including 10 deaths have been reported from Befotaka District in Atsimo- Atsinanana Region and 34 cases including 16 deaths have been reported from Iakora district in Ihorombe Region. Of the 11 samples tested, 5 were positive for plague on rapid diagnostic test and 6 are now confirmed at Institut Pasteur laboratory. Of the total reported cases, 5 are classified as pneumonic plague cases and the remaining as bubonic plague. Retrospective investigations carried out in those two districts showed that it is possible that the outbreak might have started in mid-August 2016. The investigation in neighbouring villages is still ongoing. On 29 December, an investigation carried out within 25 km of the initial foci in Befotaka district has reported three deaths and is being investigated further for possible linkage to the outbreak. The affected zone is located in a very remote and hard to reach and highly insecure area (classified as red zone due to local banditry). Despite arrangements made with the local authorities, insecurity slows down the investigations and response activities. In addition, a helicopter has been made available but its use has been limited due to bad weather and financial limitations. ### Public health response On 6 December, a 15 member multidisciplinary team from MoH, Institute Pasteur including public health professional, epidemiologist, entomologist and laboratory professional visited the affected area for epidemiological investigation and response activities. Key response activities already implemented include: * Epidemiological investigations including active case finding and rapid diagnostic testing * Training of community health workers on community-based surveillance and early detection of cases * Clinical Management of suspected cases * Identification, follow up and chemoprophylaxis of contacts * Vector and reservoir control through the use of Kartman boxes * Sensitization of the population * Strengthening the community based surveillance * Free treatment of other diagnosed disease such as malaria * Strengthening early detection in neighbouring districts * Laboratory confirmation ### WHO risk assessment Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread appears unlikely, especially as it is occurring in very remote area. However, the difficulty to reach the affected area hampered prompt investigation and therefore at this stage the real magnitude of the outbreak is still to be defined and the risk of further spread in the area and sustained transmission cannot be formally ruled out. WHO continues supporting ongoing investigation and response activities. ### WHO advice Further ecological investigations will be needed to understand the occurrence of a plague outbreak in an area which has not reported any cases of plague since 1950 in order to adapt long term surveillance and control measures. The outbreak impacts rural communities which have already suffered from remoteness and inadequate access to health services. Staff from MoH are supported by Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, who are all experienced on control measures. However, local conditions make their implementation complex. Due to the remoteness of the affected area and the conditions for getting infected by the disease, the current outbreak does not represent a significant risk for travellers. ',)",62
"(' From 1 September 2016 until 13 January 2017, a total of 693 cases including 11 deaths of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) have been reported from Am Timan, Chad. Of the 50 patients with AJS who were hospitalized, 48 were tested for Hepatitis E using the Hepatitis E virus rapid diagnostic test (HEV RDT) and 27 (56.3%) tested positive. In total, at the end of epidemiological week 2, 2017, a total of 126 HEV RDT have been performed, of them 57 (45.2%) were positive, while 69 (54.8%) tested negative for Hepatitis E. 18 (31.6%) of the 57 patients that tested positive using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test, and 20 (29%) out of 69 patients that tested negative using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test. Since September 2016, 11 deaths have been reported among the hospitalized cases but the total case fatality might be underestimated. As of 13 January 2017, 16 pregnant women presenting with AJS have been hospitalized and tested for Hepatitis E, 12 (75%) of them tested positive using the HEV RDT. Of the pregnant women presenting with AJS, four have reportedly died (three had tested positive for Hepatitis E). Approximately 90% of the AJS cases were reported from Am Timan which appears to be the epi-centre of the ongoing outbreak, and most of the cases are identified through active case findings. As of 13 January 2017, AJS cases have been reported from 59 different quartiers in and surrounding Am Timan. ### Public health response The outbreak was detected when two pregnant icteric women were admitted in the Am Timan Regional Hospital, partly supported by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) since 2009. MSF has been responding to the outbreak in support to the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) with a total of 14 expatriate staff and over 400 national staff dedicated to the epidemic response in addition to staff involved in the regular project. MSF provides support in implementing outbreak monitoring, active surveillance, water chlorination and community sensitization in Am Timan.* In addition, World Health Organization (WHO) and the MPH are complementing the initial investigations carried out between 22–29 October 2016 by extending investigations to the whole region in order to identify potential new foci.** WHO country office is also supporting the MPH in passive and active surveillance strengthening outside of Am Timan, developing case definition, surveillance tools, simple case management protocols and testing algorithm, defining criteria for case hospitalization and carrying out needs assessment in and outside the town of Am Timan. WHO is also advocating for additional needed partnerships especially to address the needs in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilisation in Am Timan as in the region.*** ### WHO risk assessment Based on the available information, there appears to be a plateau in the number of cases reported in the past 5 weeks from the affected area with an average of 70 cases reported weekly where only a minor proportion (7.2%) requires hospitalization. The infectious risk seems confined to Am Timan and immediate surroundings. However, the event remains under close monitoring at all levels of WHO. The current level of risk for further spread remains as moderate to high and at local level, and the limited capacity to respond to date calls for additional immediate support, especially in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilisation. ### WHO advice WHO recommends the continuation of the investigations with a specific case definition as to describe the time, place and person characteristics of the outbreak and identify the source. It is important to identify the source of contamination of the surface water and, in the meantime, to ensure water safety by chlorination at the point of use by the population. Travellers to Chad should follow standard hygiene recommendations in terms of water and food safety for travellers. These should protect them against Hepatitis E, as the risk of person to person transmission is very low. * * * ##### CORRIGENDUM *Please note that the first paragraph under the heading ""Public health response"" was added on 30 January 2017. **Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence on 30 January 2017 to add additional information regarding the investigations carried out during October 2016. ***Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence on 30 January 2017 to add additional contextual information regarding the needed partnerships.

"(' On 24 January 2017, Brazil’s International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) provided the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) with an update on the yellow fever situation. The geographical distribution of confirmed yellow fever human cases is expanding and includes, in addition to Minas Gerais State, the States of Espírito Santo and São Paulo. In addition, Bahia State reported 6 yellow fever human cases under investigation. Espírito Santo State, an area that was previously not considered at risk for yellow fever, confirmed its first autochthonous human case of yellow fever since 1940. The case is a 44-year-old male from the municipality of Ibatiba. São Paulo State, reported three laboratory-confirmed cases of human yellow fever, all of whom died. In Minas Gerais State, as of 24 January, a total of 404 cases (66 confirmed, 337 suspected and 1 discarded), including 84 deaths (37 among confirmed cases and 47 among suspected with a case fatality rate of 56% and 14%, respectively) were reported. The total number of suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases reported is the highest reported nationwide since 2000. Among the 66 confirmed cases from Minas Gerais State, 88% are male and 45% have not been vaccinated against yellow fever (the vaccination status of the remaining 55% is unknown or not available). Additionally, a large number of epizootics among non-human primates (NHP) were reported in the States of São Paulo (247 epizootics, including 3 confirmed for yellow fever) and Espírito Santo (367 epizootics). In Espírito Santo State, epizootics have been confirmed for yellow fever in Irupia and Colatina municipalities. ### Public health response Brazilian health authorities, at the federal, state, and municipal levels, are implementing several measures to respond to the outbreak, including: * In addition to the 650,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine distributed across the country as part of the routine supply of the National Vaccination Calendar in January 2017, the Ministry of Health of Brazil has sent 4.2 million doses of yellow fever vaccines to the States of Bahia (400,000), Espírito Santo (1 million), Minas Gerais (2.4 million), and Rio de Janeiro (350,000). * Vector control activities to eliminate Aedes aegypti breeding sites in affected municipalities have started. * A Situation Room has been established in the affected states and at the national level. * A web portal was launched by the Ministry of Health to inform the public about the situation and provide guidance. ### WHO risk assessment The increase in the number of yellow fever cases in the State of Minas Gerais, the confirmation of cases in two new states, alongside the occurrence of epizootics in the states reporting human cases, highlights the geographical spread of the outbreak to new areas. At this stage, there is no evidence that Aedes aegypti is implicated in the transmission in the current outbreak. However, the risk of urban transmission of yellow fever cannot be ruled out. It is expected that additional cases will be detected in other states in Brazil given the internal movement of people and infected monkeys and the low level of vaccination coverage in areas that were previously not considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission. There is also a risk that infected individuals may travel to areas, within or outside of Brazil, where the Aedes mosquitoes are present and initiate local cycles of human-to-human transmission. At present, there are no yellow fever cases reported in the neighbouring countries associated with this current outbreak. The current outbreak and upsurge of yellow fever activity in Brazil extends beyond those areas considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission as presented in the WHO publication “International Travel and Health, 2016”, while national authorities are taking appropriate steps to contain this epidemic, yellow fever vaccination recommendations for travellers need to be updated. The newly defined areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil present the following differences with from the 2013 risk assessment (see ""Areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil, 2013–2017"" below): * Bahia State: extension of the areas at risk for yellow fever transmission with the inclusion of the following municipalities in the south and south-west of the States: Alcobasa; Belmonte; Canavieiras; Caravelas; Ilheus; Itacare; Mucuri; Nova Visosa; Porto Seguro; Prado; Santa Cruz Cabralia; Una; Urusuca; Almadina; Anage; Arataca; Barra do Chosa; Barro Preto; Belo Campo; Buerarema; Caatiba; Camacan; Candido Sales; Coaraci; CondeUba; Cordeiros; Encruzilhada; Eunapolis; Firmino Alves; Floresta Azul; Guaratinga; Ibicarai; Ibicui; Ibirapua; Itabela; Itabuna; Itagimirim; Itaju do Colonia; Itajuipe; Itamaraju; Itambe; Itanhem; Itape; Itapebi; Itapetinga; Itapitanga; Itarantim; Itororo; Jucurusu; Jussari; Lajedao; Macarani; Maiquinique; Mascote; Medeiros Neto; Nova Canaa; Pau Brasil; Piripa; Planalto; Posoes; Potiragua; Ribeirao do Largo; Santa Cruz da Vitoria; Santa Luzia; São Jose da Vitoria; Teixeira de Freitas; Tremedal; Vereda; Vitoria da Conquista; * Espírito Santo State: at risk for yellow fever transmission with the exception of the urban area of Vitoria; * Rio de Janeiro State: at risk for yellow fever transmission in the following northern municipalities bordering Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo States: Bom Jesus do Itabapoana; Cambuci; Cardoso Moreira; Italva; Itaperuna; Laje do Muriae; Miracema; Natividade; Porciuncula; Santo Antonio de Padua; São Fidelis; São Jose de Uba; Varre-Sai; Campos dos Goytacazes; São Francisco de Itabapoa; São João da Barra. This determination of new areas deemed to be at risk for yellow fever transmission represents the first preliminary and precautionary step of a dynamic risk assessment process. ### WHO advice Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil includes vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel; observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites, awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the competent vector for yellow fever transmission is present. As per Annex 7 of the IHR a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine are not needed. If, on medical ground, a traveler cannot be vaccinated against yellow fever, this must be certified by the relevant authorities as per Annex 6 and Annex 7 of the IHR. The WHO Secretariat does not recommend restriction of travel and trade with Brazil on the basis of the information currently available on this event. ',)",407
"(' On 24 January 2017, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through their Health Alert Network (HAN) publication, reported 8 cases of infection with Seoul virus in the states of Wisconsin (n=2) and Illinois (n=6). The first two cases were reported in early December 2016, when two home-based pet rat breeders in Wisconsin State developed an acute febrile illness, later confirmed as Seoul virus infection. Rats (Rattus norvegicus) at some facilities also tested positive for Seoul virus. Human infection with Seoul virus is not commonly found in the United States; this virus family also includes Sin Nombre virus, which is the most common hantavirus causing disease in the United States. This is the first known outbreak associated with pet rats in the United States. To date, a total of 11 people have been infected in the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Colorado. Two of the individuals were hospitalized. Seoul virus infection was also confirmed in pet rats from ratteries in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. Follow-up investigations indicate that potentially infected rats may have been distributed or received in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. All investigations to date have indicated that the affected breeding facilities are limited to the pet rat trade. None of these ratteries supply (or have supplied) rats to research facilities. In addition, follow-up investigations by the United States CDC and public health officials in Canada indicate that rats have been exchanged between the United States and Canada. According to the Canada IHR national focal point report of 10 February 2017, the Canadian rat breeding facilities under investigation exported rats to the United States and also imported rats from affected United States facilities. As of 10 February 2017, three positive human cases for the Hemorrhagic Fever Renal Syndrome (HFRS) group of hantaviruses, which includes Seoul, Hantaan, Puumala and Dobrava viruses, have been identified by serology in Canada. No serious illness was reported in these individuals. Two of the cases breed rats, and the third had contact with rats. Further laboratory testing and virus characterization is ongoing. Further epidemiologic investigation and testing of rats is planned. ### Public health response Health authorities both in the United States and Canada are implementing the following measures to respond to the outbreak: Canada * Further laboratory testing and virus characterization to confirm Seoul virus exposure in humans. * Assessment of associated pet rat breeding facilities. * Further epidemiological investigation and testing of rats. United States of America * The United States CDC and State Health Departments are collaborating to investigate the outbreak. * Depopulation carried out in some affected ratteries. * Investigations regarding the importation and exportation of the rats before the detection of the outbreak ongoing. ### Information on Seoul virus Seoul virus is a type of hantavirus that is transmitted from rats to humans after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents, or after exposure to dust from their nests or bedding. Transmission may also occur from rat bites or when contaminated materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto mucous membranes. For Seoul virus, the natural host is the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the black rat (Rattus rattus). This virus has been found in both pet rats and wild rat populations around the world. The incubation period varies from 1 to 8 weeks; however, most individuals develop symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure. Seoul virus infection symptoms can range from mild to severe. In the severe form of the disease, patients can exhibit bleeding and renal syndromes. Inapparent infections can also occur. Seoul virus infection is not transmissible from human to human. There is no effective treatment available for Seoul virus infection. ### WHO risk assessment Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is the severe form of the infection with Seoul virus. The case fatality rate (CFR) among humans who develop HFRS due to Seoul virus ranges from 1-2%. Of the 11 cases reported in the United States so far, two were hospitalized and none have died. Although the three HFRS cases in Canada are still under investigation, there is some evidence of an epidemiological link to the United States Seoul virus outbreak. There is no available information on further distribution of the infected rats outside of the United States and Canada. Rats do not show symptoms of disease when they are infected with Seoul virus. Once infected, rats can continue to shed virus throughout their lives, potentially infecting other rats and humans. The United States CDC is working with state health departments in the United States and others to investigate the outbreak of Seoul virus infections in pet rats and humans, to trace shipments and transport of rats, some of which may be infected with Seoul virus, to better understand how the virus entered the pet trade and to interrupt transmission of Seoul virus to other rats and humans. Because there is presently no effective treatment for Seoul virus infection, preventing infections in people is important. If infected rodents have contact with local rat populations, the infection with Seoul virus could spread to non-infected rodents and consequently change the prevalence of this zoonotic disease, both in rodents and in humans. ### WHO advice International pet trade has the potential to spread and cause emerging or re- emerging disease in humans. WHO encourages State Parties to developed and maintain the capacity to detect, and report similar events. ',)",11

"(' From 1 December 2016 to 22 February 2017, a total of 1336 cases of yellow fever infection (292 confirmed, 920 suspected, and 124 discarded), including 215 deaths (101 confirmed, 109 suspected, 5 discarded), have been detected in six states (Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Norte, São Paulo, and Tocantins). The estimated case fatality rate is 35% for confirmed cases and 12% for suspected cases. To date, the majority (86%) of the confirmed cases are men and of which, approximately 81% are aged between 21 and 60 years. From 1 December 2016 to 22 February 2017, a total of 883 epizootics of non- human primates (NHP) have been reported, of which 337 were confirmed for yellow fever by laboratory confirmation or epidemiological link. Epizootics have been reported from the Federal District and in Alagoas, Bahia, Goiás, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins. Information on the yellow fever situation in Brazil and in other countries of the Americas is published on a weekly basis on the Pan American Health Organization/ World Health Organization website (PAHO/ WHO) (see link below). ### Public health response Brazilian health authorities at the federal, state, and municipal levels are implementing several measures to respond to the outbreak, including: * The Ministry of Health (MoH) are assisting state and municipal health secretaries with human, vector and epizootic surveillance, strengthening of health care services, and risk communication. * Vector control activities including environmental sanitation and spatial application of insecticide are being conducted alongside surveys to assess infestation rates for Aedes using the Larval Index Rapid Aedes assay (LIRAa). * National reference centers including Evandro Chagas Institute in Belem do Para and FioCruz in Rio de Janeiro are supporting field operations concerning human and NHP case confirmation and entomological investigations. * House-to-house and fixed post immunization campaigns are being conducted in municipalities at risk. * A cumulative total of 12.5 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine have been distributed by the MoH to Minas Gerais (5.5 million), Espírito Santo (2.5 million), São Paulo (2.75 million), Bahia (900 000), and Rio de Janeiro (850 000). To support Brazil health authorities in their response efforts, PAHO has activated a dedicated event management structure, which will work together with WHO headquarters. Furthermore, technical experts from both PAHO headquarters and the PAHO country office in Brazil have been deployed to assist with the coordination of operations, epidemiological investigations, data collection, and information management. ### WHO risk assessment The growing number of reported cases, the detection of yellow fever circulation in new states, and the occurrence of epizootics in areas that were previously not considered at risk of yellow fever transmission indicate that the geographic extent of the outbreak is increasing. Although Brazilian health authorities have swiftly implemented a series of public health measures to control the outbreak, including mass vaccination campaigns, it may take some time to reach optimal coverage in some of the areas at risk as a large portion of the affected populations are dispersed and live in remote locations. It is, therefore, expected that in the near term additional cases will continued to be detected. To date, in the three states with laboratory-confirmed yellow fever human cases, there has been no evidence of transmission by Aedes aegypti; nevertheless, entomological indices in urban centers of these three states are sufficiently high for sustaining arbovirus transmission, as evidenced by documented outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and Zika outbreak in late 2016. The reports of suspected epizootics in the rural areas of states bordering Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia are a cause of concern as the outbreak may potentially spread to one or more of these countries due to favourable conditions for yellow fever transmission and suboptimal levels of vaccination coverage. The introduction of the virus in these countries could potentially trigger large epidemics of yellow fever. In view of the evolving situation, and considering that travellers for the Carnival in the next few weeks may take side tours outside the main cities, a further spread within Brazil cannot be excluded. Likewise, the risk of international spread cannot be formally ruled out but this risk is currently considered to be very low and limited to unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission predominantly in areas where the competent vector is present. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil includes vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel; observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites, awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the competent vector for yellow fever transmission is present).

"(' On 25 April 2017, the Ministry of Health of Liberia notified WHO and partners of a cluster of sudden deaths of unknown aetiology in Sinoe County. The event started on 23 April 2017 when an 11-year-old child had been admitted to hospital presenting with diarrhoea, vomiting and mental confusion after attending the funeral of a religious leader on 22 April 2017. The child died within one hour of admission. As of 4 May 2017, a total of 28 cases including 12 deaths (case fatality rate: 43 %) were reported. Of those, 26 cases including 10 deaths were reported from Sinoe County, all in persons who had attended the funeral. The other two cases, both fatal, were reported from the capital Monrovia in Montserrado County. The first case in Monrovia had attended the funeral in Sinoe County and presented with fever, headache and vomiting on 27 April 2017. He passed away at a hospital in Monrovia. On 29 April 2017, his partner who did not attend the funeral also became ill and passed away the same day. Investigations are still ongoing. To date, a total of 21 specimens have tested negative for Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Lassa fever. Samples from individuals (e.g. blood, urine, rectal swab, and others) and environment, including food samples are being further analyzed and tested. ### Public health response The Sinoe County Health Team is coordinating the response with the support of WHO, UNICEF, CDC, Africa Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), and other partners. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) and the Incident Management System are activated for the management of the event. Cases from Sinoe are being managed in the local hospital in Greenville, the capital of Sinoe County. The initial investigation was conducted by the RRT and active case search is being implemented in the affected and surrounding communities and among people that attended the funeral. In Montserrado County, a total of 42 individuals who participated in the burial in Greenville on 22 April 2017 are being closely monitored. In addition, close contacts of the two cases that died in Montserrado County are also being closely monitored. The National Epidemic Preparedness and Response Committee led by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia has also been activated to support the response. National multidisciplinary teams are deployed to the affected county to provide technical support. Surveillance is being strengthened through line-listing of cases, contact identification and follow-up, active case search and collection of food and drink samples for toxicology testing. Attendants of the funeral and contacts have been listed and are under follow-up. The laboratory analysis is being strengthened. Water testing from the sources serving the affected areas has been conducted and preliminary results ruled out bacterial contamination. Heavy metal and chemical testing is ongoing. The government has requested WHO, CDC, and MSF to support the process of toxicological testing outside the country. Samples are being sent to different laboratories for additional testing. Community engagement is being strengthened, with the support of UNICEF, through mass public awareness, local leaders’ mobilization, and community member sensitization. Infection prevention and control measures are being implemented, namely re-enforcement of hand hygiene practices, water points testing and safe burials. ### WHO risk assessment At this stage the overall risk of spread of the event is considerate as low. The event is clustered among the participants of the funeral. In addition, there is a sharp decrease in the number of cases and deaths reported since 25 April 2017. These findings are indicative of a point source of exposure. The possibility of a food/ drink/ water contamination event is being actively investigated and the toxicology laboratory test will help to elaborate this hypothesis. A case-control study to identify possible exposures linked to illness is being conducted. The efficient and timely implementation of the response to this event is a result of the expertise developed in Liberia following the large outbreak of EVD in 2014. This led to the quick identification of the event, testing and ruling out EVD as a causative agent, identification of contacts and their follow-up and the ongoing collaboration of the country with partners to perform laboratory testing of human and environmental specimen to identify the disease aetiology. ### WHO advice WHO recommends the close follow up of the cases and persons who attended the funeral as well as the reinforcement of hygiene and food safety measures in the affected areas. Additionally, WHO supports the ongoing epidemiological and laboratory investigations to identify the aetiological agent of this cluster of cases to guide additional control measures. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Liberia on the basis of the information available on the current event. ',)",28
"(' On 9 May 2017, WHO was informed of a cluster of undiagnosed illness and deaths including haemorrhagic symptoms in Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province in the north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), bordering Central African Republic. Since 22 April, nine cases including three deaths have been reported. Six cases are currently hospitalized. On 11 May 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of DRC informed WHO that of the five samples collected from suspected cases, one tested positive by RT-PCR for Ebola virus subtype Zaire at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. Additional specimens are currently being tested and results, including sequencing, are awaited to describe the outbreak. On 10 May 2017, a multidisciplinary team led by the MoH and supported by WHO and partners was deployed to the field and are expected to reach the affected area on 12 or 13 May 2017 to conduct an in depth field investigation. The investigation is currently ongoing and information is available for only three of the suspected cases: The first case (and possibly the index case), a 39-year-old male presented onset of symptoms on 22 April 2017 and deceased on arrival at the health facility. He presented with haematuria, epistaxis, bloody diarrhoea, and haematemesis. Two contacts of this case are being investigated: a person who took care of him during transport to the health care facility (he has since developed similar symptoms) and a moto-taxi driver (deceased) who transported the patient to the health care facility. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for health care workers has been shipped on 12 May 2017 to Kisangani. Additional kits are currently being prepared and will be shipped as soon as available. ### Background and epidemiological situation On 20 November 2014, as per WHO recommendations, the MoH of DRC and WHO declared the end of the EVD outbreak that started on 24 August 2014 and resulted in a total of 38 laboratory confirmed cases and 28 probable case including 49 deaths in Boende, Equateur province. This was the seventh outbreak of EVD since its discovery in 1976 in DRC. * 2014: 66 cases of EVD including 49 deaths diagnosed initially in Equateur province (Watsi Kengo, Lokolia, Boende, and Boende Muke). * 2012: 36 cases including 13 deaths Orientale province - Isiro (Bundibugyo virus). * 2008–2009: 32 cases including 15 deaths in Kasaï-Occidental (Zaire virus). * 2007: 264 cases including 187 deaths in Kasaï-Occidental (Zaire virus). * 1995: 315 cases and 250 deaths occurred in Kikwit and surrounding area. * 1977: 1 case (Zaire virus). * 1976: 318 cases including 280 deaths in Yambuku (Zaire virus). There are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location where they have been first detected. Three of the five subtypes have been associated with large Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in Africa. Ebola–Zaire, Ebola–Sudan and Ebola–Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25–90% of all cases. ### Public health response The following public health response measures have been implemented: * The national committee against viral haemorrhagic fever has been reactivated and will continue meeting every day to coordinate the response. * Strengthening of surveillance and investigation including contact tracing are ongoing. * WHO will provide assistance and technical support. The deployment to DRC of an additional WHO multidisciplinary team is currently considered to support the response of national authorities. * The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has been activated to provide additional support if required. * The need and feasibility of potential Ebola ring vaccination is being discussed. ### WHO risk assessment To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote and hard to reach area and appears to be geographically relatively limited. However, Investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance still needs to be maintained. WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to DRC based on the currently available information. ',)",9
"(' Between June 2016 and mid-May 2017, an unusual increase in cases of hepatitis A affecting mainly men who have sex with men (MSM) has been reported by low endemicity countries in the European Region, and in the Americas (Chile and the United States of America). In the European Region, 15 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) reported 1173 cases related to the three distinct multi-country hepatitis A outbreaks as of 16 May 2017. In Chile, 706 hepatitis A cases were reported at national level as of 5 May 2017. In the United States, the New York City Health Department has noted an increase in hepatitis A cases among MSM who did not report international travel. In low endemicity settings, WHO recommends hepatitis A vaccination for high- risk groups, such as travellers to endemic areas, MSM, people who inject drugs, and chronic liver disease patients.* For MSM the main risk factor is related to sexual transmission, particularly oral-anal sexual contact. Most of the affected countries have routinely recommended hepatitis A vaccine for MSM. This event is of particular concern from a public health perspective because of the current limited availability of hepatitis A vaccine worldwide. In addition, several national and international lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) pride festivals will take place between June and September 2017, including the World Pride Festival in Madrid, Spain between 23 June and 2 July 2017. In this regard, WHO requests countries to report to WHO Regional IHR Contact points any unusual increase in the number of hepatitis A cases among MSM. ### WHO risk assessment Infection with hepatitis A virus is typically acute and self-limiting. Hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal. Some patients may develop more severe symptoms which may last up to a few months. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the feces of an infected person. The virus can also be transmitted through close physical contact with an infectious person, through dirty hands and through sexual contact. In low endemicity countries, reported rates of hepatitis A are low. Disease may occur among adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, such as injecting- drug users, MSM, people travelling to areas of high endemicity, and in isolated populations, such as closed religious communities. So far, no fatalities have been reported in connection with the ongoing outbreaks. It has the potential to spread further to the general population if control measures (vaccination, hygiene, food safety, and safer sex measures) are not implemented. ### WHO advice * Countries with low endemicity profile for hepatitis A should routinely offer vaccination to individuals at increased risk of hepatitis A and of a serious complications following infection. The recommended risk groups, among others, include men who have sex with men. Vaccination against hepatitis A should be included as part of a comprehensive package of services to prevent and control of viral hepatitis, including health education and measures for outbreak control. * Use of hepatitis A vaccine should be preferred for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g. for close contacts of acute cases of hepatitis A). * Countries may consider single-dose schedule for hepatitis A vaccination to control outbreaks of hepatitis A, especially when vaccine availability is scarce. * Public health messaging should be directed at groups at increased risk of hepatitis A and of serious complications from the infection. * Information should include advice on prevention - vaccination, hygiene, food safety and safer sex measures. ### Madrid LGBT World Pride festival The Madrid LGBT World Pride festival will be held between 23 June and 2 July 2017 in Spain. Up to two million international guests are expected to attend the event. Although the risk for transmission of hepatitis A by food- and water-related routes in Spain is assessed to be low to moderate, the risk of person-to-person sexual transmission of hepatitis A is moderate to high. In Spain, hepatitis A cases reported in 2017 are almost eight times higher than the average number of cases reported during the same period between the years 2012 and 2016. Most cases are men with ages between 15 to 45 years old, and MSM are the most affected group. Specific recommendations for people attending the LGBT World Pride festival are below. * Before the event: Those attending the event should seek advice from healthcare providers on hepatitis A vaccination, HIV, and other STI prevention measures prior to departure. * During the event: Preventive measures should be reinforced to reduce the risk of sexual and / or food and water borne infections. * After the event: Attendants should contact a healthcare provider if experiencing symptoms suggestive of hepatitis A or STI infection. * * * *In intermediate endemicity setting, hepatitis A vaccination can be considered for the whole population, while in high endemicity, infections are common, but the disease is uncommon, hence, the vaccine is not recommended.

It has the potential to spread further to the general population if control measures (vaccination, hygiene, food safety, and safer sex measures) are not implemented. ### WHO advice * Countries with low endemicity profile for hepatitis A should routinely offer vaccination to individuals at increased risk of hepatitis A and of a serious complications following infection. The recommended risk groups, among others, include men who have sex with men. Vaccination against hepatitis A should be included as part of a comprehensive package of services to prevent and control of viral hepatitis, including health education and measures for outbreak control. * Use of hepatitis A vaccine should be preferred for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g. for close contacts of acute cases of hepatitis A). * Countries may consider single-dose schedule for hepatitis A vaccination to control outbreaks of hepatitis A, especially when vaccine availability is scarce. * Public health messaging should be directed at groups at increased risk of hepatitis A and of serious complications from the infection. * Information should include advice on prevention - vaccination, hygiene, food safety and safer sex measures. ### Madrid LGBT World Pride festival The Madrid LGBT World Pride festival will be held between 23 June and 2 July 2017 in Spain. Up to two million international guests are expected to attend the event. Although the risk for transmission of hepatitis A by food- and water-related routes in Spain is assessed to be low to moderate, the risk of person-to-person sexual transmission of hepatitis A is moderate to high. In Spain, hepatitis A cases reported in 2017 are almost eight times higher than the average number of cases reported during the same period between the years 2012 and 2016. Most cases are men with ages between 15 to 45 years old, and MSM are the most affected group. Specific recommendations for people attending the LGBT World Pride festival are below. * Before the event: Those attending the event should seek advice from healthcare providers on hepatitis A vaccination, HIV, and other STI prevention measures prior to departure. * During the event: Preventive measures should be reinforced to reduce the risk of sexual and / or food and water borne infections. * After the event: Attendants should contact a healthcare provider if experiencing symptoms suggestive of hepatitis A or STI infection. * * * *In intermediate endemicity setting, hepatitis A vaccination can be considered for the whole population, while in high endemicity, infections are common, but the disease is uncommon, hence, the vaccine is not recommended.

"(' A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been confirmed in the Deir Al Zour Governorate of the Syrian Arab Republic. There is evidence of genetic linkage among three isolates of type-2 vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV2) isolated in the stool specimens of two acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases with dates of onset of paralysis on 5 March and 6 May 2017, and the contact specimen of an AFP case collected on 17 April 2017. Al Mayadeen was also the epi-centre of the wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak in Syrian Arab Republic in 2013. Aggressive multi-country polio outbreak response effectively controlled the WPV1 outbreak and no WPV1 case has been reported in Syrian Arab Republic since 21 January 2014. ### Public health response Since the confirmation of the first VDPV2 during May 2017, AFP surveillance has been intensified in the Governorate, especially in the Al Mayadeen district. As of 6 June 2017, a total of 58 AFP cases have been reported from the Governorate this year. In addition to the two cases that have tested positive for VDPV2, a further 11 have tested negative for polioviruses, with the remaining samples being under process in the laboratories or being transported to the laboratories. Subsequent to the confirmation of the cVDPV2 outbreak, outbreak response planning is underway, including planning for supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2), in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Although access for vaccination is compromised due to prevailing insecurity in Deir Al Zour, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, two campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). The most recent full trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) round was conducted in October 2015; while tOPV rounds conducted in the first four months of 2016 only reached part of the target population of the Deir Al Zour Governorate. It is pertinent to mention that Syrian Arab Republic introduced two doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the routine infant immunization schedule in 2008. Syrian Arab Republic switched from tOPV to bOPV for routine immunization on 1 May 2016. A detailed risk analysis is currently being updated, including assessing overall population immunity levels and strengthening active searches for additional cases of AFP. Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries as well. ### WHO risk assessment The detection of cVDPV2 underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. Such events also underscore the risk in areas or regions with continued substantial insecurity that hampers maintaining high population immunity through routine vaccination. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop the VDPV2 transmission. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented. ### WHO advice It is important to complete the ongoing risk assessment as soon as possible to inform the vaccination response with mOPV2 and IPV. The geographical scale of the vaccination response will be in accordance with the findings of the risk assessment. It will be critical to achieve the highest possible coverage during the vaccination response. Given the difficult and challenging security situation in the area, appropriate strategies will be identified and utilized to implement the response. Intensified AFP surveillance should continue. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months prior to the travel. As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

"(' Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is known to be endemic in various West African countries including Nigeria. As of 9 June 2017, a total of 501 suspected cases including 104 deaths have been reported since the onset of the current Lassa fever outbreaks season in December 2016. Of the reported cases, 189 have been further classified, 175 laboratory- confirmed including 59 deaths and 14 probable cases (all dead). During the current Lassa fever outbreak, 17 Nigerian states (Anambra, Bauchi, Borno, Cross-River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Kogi, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Plateau, Rivers, and Taraba) have reported at least one confirmed case. As of 9 June 2017, the outbreak is still active in nine states (Anambra, Bauchi, Cross-River, Edo, Taraba, Nasarawa, Ondo, Plateau, and Kano). ### Public health response The ongoing outbreak response is focused at State and federal levels and involves coordination of weekly Lassa fever review meeting in conjunction with World Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), and the African Field Epidemiology Network. The following response measures are being carried out: * Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all affected states and Lassa fever cases are reported to the federal level and contact tracing is ongoing in affected states with an active outbreak through the state surveillance team. * The line listing of cases reported across all the states is ongoing and data are uploaded in the VHF database. * Lassa fever treatment centers have been established in the affected states to support case management. These centers are supplied with case management as well as infection prevention and control supplies. ### WHO risk assessment Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness. Lassa fever is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and other West African countries and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the region, with yearly peaks observed between December and June. Overall, the current risk assessment for Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend of outbreaks. Considering this, ongoing response measures remains focused on preparedness and response in general and further risk of large scale outbreaks is not very high. However, a close follow up, active case searching, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (in the community and for health care workers) should remain ongoing. Although there is constant population movement between these Nigerian states, a large- scale disease transmission or outbreak spread has not been reported. However, there have been sporadic cases reported in Togo and Benin originating from Nigeria. ### WHO advice Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good “community hygiene” to discourage rodents from entering homes. In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. On rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing. ',)",501
"(' This is an update to the Disease Outbreak News “Unexplained cluster of deaths – Liberia” published on 5 May 2017 and update published on 10 May 2017. On 25 April 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Liberia notified WHO and partners of a cluster of sudden deaths of unknown aetiology in Sinoe County. The event started on 23 April 2017, when an 11-year-old female had been admitted to hospital presenting with diarrhoea, vomiting, and mental confusion after attending the funeral of a religious leader on 22 April 2017. The child died within one hour of admission. Between 23 April and 7 May, a total of 31 cases including 13 deaths, and one case with neurological sequelae of an unknown disease associated with attending a funeral were reported from three counties (Sinoe, Grand Bassa, and Montserrado). The majority of cases did not present with fever, but did present with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and mental confusion. Some patients presented with purpura and/ or petechiae. Most of the cases were related to each other either socially, through family or school. All but two cases attended the funeral, who were subsequently identified as contacts of the index case. On 8 May 2017, MoH informed partners and the public that specimens taken from patients tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis serotype C at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak was therefore classified as a meningococcal disease outbreak. A total of 14 cases out of 31 cases were later confirmed with presence of Neisseria meningitidis C by PCR in clinical specimens conducted at the National Reference Laboratory in Liberia or clinically diagnosed due to the presence of purpura fulminans. Laboratory results were further confirmed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) in Johannesburg, South Africa, in addition to serological results of three cases that were tested at Institute Pasteur in France. The temporal characteristics of this outbreak are unusual raising the hypothesis of the presence of a co-factor. Additionally, on 8 May 2017, the MoH informed partners and the public that toxicological investigations conducted by CDC on urine samples from three cases did not suggest that intoxication was the cause of the outbreak. The samples were tested for pesticide metabolites and toxic metals. On 20 June 2017, the MoH was notified that results of toxicological investigations carried out at the Center for Analytical Chemistry in Vienna, Austria, on food samples, water and a soft drink that were consumed during the funeral, were not suggestive of intoxication. The samples were tested for more than 600 fungal and bacterial toxins and these were either not detected or were within regulatory limits. ### Public health response The MoH supported by the WHO, CDC, Africa Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), and other partners started on-site investigations one day after the alert. No disease was identified at the start of the outbreak and Ebola virus disease (EVD) was ruled out within 24 hours of the alert. The National Public Health Institute of Liberia was activated to lead the response. WHO, CDC, UNICEF, and MSF reinforced the field response, and international coordination and information sharing was supported though the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The following response activities were implemented: * Most of the cases from Sinoe were managed in the local hospital in Greenville, the capital of Sinoe County and received treatment as per EVD protocol. * Infection, prevention, and control measures were implemented in the local hospital. * Active case searching was conducted and identified attendees of the funeral and close contacts of the cases were followed up for 21 days. * Autopsies were conducted on two patients. * Approximately 70 specimens (58 clinical specimens and 12 food samples) were collected for laboratory testing and sent to the national reference laboratory in Margibi County, the United States, France, South Africa, and Austria. * Chemoprophylaxis was distributed to all attendees, contacts of the cases, health workers, and burial personnel. * A meningitis C vaccination strategy was discussed but not implemented due to the lack of secondary transmission. * Social mobilization was implemented with the support of UNICEF. ### WHO risk assessment In the absence of clear understanding of the epidemiology of this outbreak , the risk of recurrence cannot be excluded. However, based on current understanding of the epidemiology of meningococcal disease, the risk is considered low. The efficient and timely implementation of the response to this event is a result of the expertise developed in Liberia following the large outbreak of EVD in 2014. This led to the quick identification of the event, testing and ruling out EVD as the cause of the outbreak, identification of contacts and their follow-up and the collaboration of the country with partners to perform laboratory testing of human and environmental specimens, which led to the identification of the cause of the disease. ### WHO advice WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Liberia on the basis of the information available on the current event. WHO recommends the inclusion of meningococcal septicemia in routine surveillance in Liberia as an epidemic prone disease together with meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis. ',)",31
"(' On 7 June 2017, World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a cholera outbreak in Kwara State, Nigeria, where the event currently remains localized. The first cases of acute watery diarrhoea were reported during the last week of April 2017 and a sharp increase in the number of cases and deaths has been observed since 1 May 2017. However, the number of new cases reported has shown a decline over the last four reporting weeks. As of 30 June 2017, a total of 1558 suspected cases of cholera have been reported including 11 deaths (case fatality rate: 0.7%). Thirteen of these cases were confirmed by culture in laboratory. 50% of the suspected cases reported are male and 49% are female (information for gender is missing for 1% of the suspected cases). The disease is affecting all age groups. Between 1 May and 30 June 2017, suspected cholera cases in Kwara State were reported from five local government areas; Asa (18), Ilorin East (450), Ilorin South (215), Ilorin West (780), and Moro (50) (information for local government areas is missing for 45 of the suspected cases). Poor sanitation conditions observed in the affected communities is one of the predisposing factors for this cholera outbreak. An important risk factor is the lack of access to clean drinking water and poor hygiene conditions. ### Public health response The State Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operations Center to coordinate the outbreak response with support from the Nigeria Centers for Disease Control, Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program, National Primary Health Care Development Agency, the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, WHO, and partners. The following response measures are being carried out: * National multidisciplinary teams were deployed to Kwara State to provide technical support. * Cases are being managed in local health care facilities in Kwara State. Active case searching is ongoing in the affected and surrounding communities. These have been strengthened with the formation of surveillance teams made up of the above mentioned partners, and the deployment of local government area Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers (DSNOs). * Collation and data entry of cases is currently ongoing. * In order to improve laboratory investigations, cholera rapid diagnostic tests are being distributed to selected facilities and health care staff trained on their use. * Efforts to improve case management are ongoing. On 15 June 2017, clinicians from the three most affected local government areas were trained on cholera case management, and infection prevention and control (IPC). The current IPC capacity is not well developed and there is poor access to safe water, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions as well as severe challenges to adhere to IPC standards. Efforts are further impeded by limitations of supplies, and a general requirement for patients to pay for treatment. * Social mobilization activities continue with the use of Yoruba language radio ‘jingles’, and religious leaders had been sensitized in the affected state to create awareness and prompt early presentation to healthcare facilities. Communities have been mobilized through house to house sensitization on the use of Aquatab for household water treatment and safe water storage. * Environmental investigations are ongoing, and water samples (a local community well and household drinking water) have tested positive for Vibrio cholerae. * Laboratory response activities include the prepositioning and on-the-job training on use of rapid diagnostic tests in two health facilities. Sensitivity results of Vibrio cholerae shows resistance to Tetracycline and Ampicillin. Also, additional rapid diagnostic kits are expected to arrive. * A multisectoral approach needs to be emphasized and participation encouraged. This would include ensuring proper medical waste management by the State Ministry of Health and access to clean portable water by the Ministry of water resources. ### WHO risk assessment The current outbreak occurs while the country is facing a serious humanitarian situation and is recovering from a large meningitis outbreak. At this stage, the overall risk is moderate at national level. Potential issues of concern for this outbreak include the ongoing rainy season, the capacity challenges at the State level to manage the outbreak and the sharing of borders with five other States as well as Republic of Benin. Although these issues can potentially lead to the worsening of the outbreak and its spread to other States and neighbouring countries, the country has capacities to quickly control the outbreak. The surveillance system should be strengthened in neighboring States to ease early detection of any potential spread of the outbreak. ### WHO advice WHO recommends enhanced surveillance for the detection of new cases and improvement of record keeping and data management at healthcare facility level. WHO recommends the urgent establishment of cholera treatment centres in the most affected areas, ensuring that adequate logistics are in place and that medical supplies are in stock. The establishment of a multisectoral approach is imperative to successfully addressing this outbreak. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on the current event. ',)",1558
"(' On 18 June 2017, the Nigerian Ministry of Health notified World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of hepatitis E located in the north-east region of the country. The first case was detected on 3 May 2017 in Damasak, a locality at the border with the Republic of the Niger. Samples were collected from the case and sent to laboratory for confirmation. Cases were later reported in Ngala, one of the local government areas in Borno State that borders Cameroon. As of 2 July 2017, 146 confirmed and suspected cases were reported including 21 confirmed cases. In Ngala, 25 infected pregnant women (21%) were reported, including two deaths (case fatality rate = 8%). Cases were reported from three local government areas: Ngala (112), Mobbar (19), and Monguno (14). The number of hepatitis E cases is highest in Ngala with 29 cases reported from 19 June to 2 July 2017. Twenty-seven samples were shipped to the virology laboratory in Lagos for further diagnosis. Among the samples collected and tested, 21 tested positive (10 in Ngala, seven in Mobbar, four in Monguno) and six tested negative. Twenty-three samples have been collected and are pending laboratory tests. This hepatitis E outbreak can propagate rapidly due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region which arises from the volatile security situation in north-eastern Nigeria and continues to persist. This crisis in Nigeria has been ongoing for eight years and as a result 1.9 million people are internally displaced. The region has been facing intense movements of population coming from refugee camps or displaced populations in the areas bordering Chad and Niger. In addition, the fresh wave of returnees from neighbouring countries is overwhelming the current humanitarian capacity. Returnees began entering the town in January 2017 and so far the town has an estimated population of 90 000, according to International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and immigration officials. The town has one unofficial camp hosting returnees considered as strangers or people not affiliated to any of the indigenous communities who have settled in the town. As a result there is overcrowding which is overwhelming the already weak systems in place. Lack of access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services may lead to propagation of this disease at a very rapid rate. ### Public health response Coordinating partners in this response include WHO, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Oxfam (representing the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), FHI 360, ICRC (working with Nigerian Red Cross) and North East Regional Initiative (NERI). Response activities for this outbreak include the following: * WHO and MSF are supporting case management at no cost to patients and this includes hospitalization of those in need, availability of drugs, and health personnel. Symptomatic case management is supported by MSF at the district level. * Epidemiological surveillance system at health facilities exists with the support of local partners. * Technical support is being provided from WHO and other partners. * As of 15 June 2017, WASH assessed and mapped the current water sources and established contacts for a rapid response in the chlorination of water. * A multisectoral approach needs to be emphasized and coordinated between the State Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, and Ministries of Water and Environment. * Public health awareness through sensitizations and announcements in mosques and other public places by local government area health educators is taking place. In addition, local health personnel are being sensitized, eight Volunteer Community Mobilizers (VCMs), the health care staff, MSF, UNICEF and FHI 360. ### WHO risk assessment Nigeria shares an international border with four countries, Chad and Cameroon in the east, Republic of the Niger to the north, and Republic of Benin on the west. The areas of insecurity are located in north-eastern Nigeria, bordering Republic of the Niger, Cameroon, and Chad. The hepatitis E outbreak is taking place in this same area. This area is characterized by a hepatitis E outbreak in neighbouring Chad and in Republic of the Niger. The ongoing humanitarian crisis and insecurity, high numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and refugees, and poor access to safe water leads to the spread of disease. There are also an increasing number of displaced persons moving back to the region post occupation. In addition, the potential cross-border contamination and subsequent increased risk of spread from Republic of the Niger and other neighbouring countries should be considered. There are a number of refugee and IDP camps that are overcrowded and have poor sanitation conditions thereby increasing the risk of hepatitis E. Therefore the observed risk at the national level is high. The risk at regional level is moderate especially in the countries around the humanitarian crisis in north-eastern Nigeria. The risk at global level is low. ### WHO advice WHO recommends the improvement of the quality and access to safe drinking water, through different methods including the use of at home water purification techniques. The quality of water should be regularly monitored in the affected areas. In addition, WHO recommends the improvement of sanitation by treating and dispensing of human waste correctly as well as improving personal hygiene and the preparation of safe and clean food. The number of latrines in different camps should be increased to address open defaecation. The ongoing interventions should target at risk populations through establishment of antenatal counselling for pregnant women, improving housing conditions for refugees and IDPs and supporting partners in improving health facilities and care. The local and national reference laboratory capacities should be improved for timely confirmation of suspected cases. Cross-border interventions should be strengthened through the Lake Chad sub-regional approach for the management of the current outbreak. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on the current event. ',)",146
"(' From 1 January to 7 July 2017, the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) Sri Lanka reported 80 732 dengue fever cases, including 215 deaths. This is a 4.3 fold higher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016, and the monthly number of cases exceeds the mean plus three standard deviations for each of the past six months. Based on sentinel site surveillance for the past seven years the expected peak months of May to July coincides with the south-western monsoon which commences in late April. Approximately 43% of the dengue fever cases were reported from the Western Province and the most affected area with the highest number of reported cases is Colombo District (18 186) followed by Gampaha (12 121), Kurunegala (4889), Kalutara (4589), Batticaloa (3946), Ratnapura (3898), and Kandy (3853). Preliminary laboratory results have identified Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) as the circulating strain in this outbreak. Although all four DENV have been co-circulating in Sri Lanka for more than 30 years and DENV-2 has been infrequently detected since 2009. The current dengue fever outbreak occurs in a context of massive heavy rains and flooding and is currently affecting 15 out of 25 districts in Sri Lanka where almost 600 000 people have been affected. Heavy monsoon rains, public failure to clear rain-soaked garbage, standing water pools and other potential breeding grounds for mosquito larvae attribute to the higher number of cases reported in urban and suburban areas. ### Public health response World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the MoH Sri Lanka to ensure an efficient and comprehensive health response and the following response measures include: * Support from the military forces has been requested by the MoH to increase the number of beds as the health care facilities are overwhelmed. Three temporary wards in a hospital 38km north of Colombo have now been completed. * The MoH launched an emergency response including vector control activities that is also supported by the mobilization of defense forces. The army, police and civil defense forces have been mobilized to conduct house-to-house visits in the high-risk areas with health staff. In addition, they are involved in mobilizing the community for garbage disposal, cleaning of vector breeding sites, and in health education. * The Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) has constituted a Task Force to guide the response. * WHO/ SEARO deployed an epidemiologist, an entomologist and two dengue management experts from the WHO Collaborating Center for case management of Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, Thailand) and Ministry of Public health (MoPH) Thailand. The triage protocol was updated in June 2017 to assist with better management of the patients in the health facilities. * The WHO Sri Lanka country office has purchased 50 fogging machines to support vector control activities. * MOH and WHO have worked together to prepare a strategic and operational plan for intensive measures to control dengue outbreak in next few weeks. ### WHO risk assessment Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; secondary infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the vectors widely adapted to urban and suburban environments. Dengue fever is endemic in Sri Lanka, and occurs every year, usually soon after rainfall is optimal for mosquito breeding. However DENV-2 has been identified only in low numbers since 2009 and is reportedly over 50% of current specimens which have been serotyped. The current dengue epidemic is likely to have repercussions on public health in Sri Lanka. ### WHO advice WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including those of dengue. The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing human–vector contact through adult control measures. Both control measures need to implemented simultaneously for effective control. This can be achieved by reducing the number of artificial water containers that hold water (cement tanks for water storage, drums, used tyres, empty bottles, coconut shells, etc.) in and around the home and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and use of insect repellents, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils etc. and space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure. As protection from the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission), it is recommended to sleep (particularly young children, the sick or elderly) under mosquito bed nets, treated with or without insecticide. WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied on Sri Lanka based on the information available for this event. ',)",80732
"(' Since the beginning of 2017, Kenya is experiencing an upsurge of cholera cases. The first cholera outbreak reported in 2017 was in Tana River County. The outbreak started on 10 October 2016 and was controlled by April 2017. A second wave of cholera outbreaks started in Garissa County on 2 April 2017 and was reported later in nine other counties including Nairobi, Murang’a, Vihiga, Mombasa, Turkana, Kericho, Nakuru, Kiambu, and Narok. The outbreak is being reported in the general population and in refugee camps. In Garissa County, the outbreak is affecting mainly Dadaab refugee camps and cases and deaths are being reported from Hagadera, Dagahaleh, and IFO2 camps. In Turkana county, the disease is also affecting Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps. In addition to the outbreak reported in the general population, there have been two point source cholera outbreaks in Nairobi County. One occurred among participants attending a conference in a Nairobi hotel on 22 June 2017. A total of 146 patients associated with this outbreak have been treated in different hospitals in Nairobi. A second outbreak occurred at the China Trade Fair held at the KICC Tsavo Ball between 10 and 12 July 2017. A total of 136 cases were reported and one death. Currently, the outbreak is active in two counties, namely Garissa and Nairobi. As of 17 July 2017, a total of 1216 suspected cases including 14 deaths (case fatality rate: 1.2%) have been reported since 1 January 2017. In the week ending 16 July 2017, a total of 38 cases with no deaths were reported. A total of 124 cases tested positive for Vibrio cholerae in the reference laboratory. In the week ending 25 June 2017, 18 samples out of 25 tested positive for Vibrio cholerae Ogawa by culture at the National Public Health Laboratory in Nairobi. The main causative factors of the current outbreak include the high population density that is conducive to the propagation and spread of the disease, mass gatherings (a wedding party held in Karen and in a hotel during an international conference), low access to safe water and proper sanitation and the massive population movements in country and with neighbouring countries. Since December 2014, the Republic of Kenya has been experiencing continuous large outbreaks of cholera, with a cumulative total of 17 597 cases reported (10 568 cases reported in 2015 and 6448 in 2016). ### Public health response The country has activated the national task force to coordinate the response to the outbreak. Since January 2017, WHO and partners are providing technical support to the country for the control of the outbreak. The country will develop a response plan with focus on the preparedness interventions to avert further spread of the outbreak. The WHO country office will repurpose their staff members and experts deployed in Nairobi for the management of the post El Niño effects in the Horn of Africa to support the quick control of this outbreak. WHO will also support the five most at risk counties with disease surveillance and response coordination. Partners on the ground are committed to provide support to the ongoing response efforts including support to primary health care and social mobilization by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). ### WHO risk assessment Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of bacterium Vibrio cholerae present in faecally contaminated water or food. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is always considered a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the exposure frequency, population exposed and the context. Cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Republic of Kenya every year with large cyclical epidemics every five to seven years. The risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at national and regional levels and moderate at global level. The outbreak occurred in the context of a sub-regional drought, conflicts and insecurity in the Horn of Africa. In addition, the outbreak is affecting the densely populated capital city Nairobi, and two large refugee camps (Kakuma and Dadaab) with massive population movements within country and between neighbouring countries. Previous large outbreaks in the Republic of Kenya have originated from similar settings, and the risk for propagation of cholera within the affected area as well as to other parts of the country is high. The country has identified a limited capacity for response and low access to safe water. There is an opportunity to implement early preparedness and response measures to contain the outbreak and prevent spread. The current outbreaks linked to mass gathering activities poses additional risk of food safety as well as the need to conduct sanitary inspection in restaurants and hotels. ### WHO recommendations WHO recommends improving the readiness of counties and health facilities to early detect and respond to the cholera outbreak as well as the reinforcement of coordination and multisectoral approaches. In addition, hygiene practices in households, restaurant, hotels, refugee camps and health facilities should be improved and food safety interventions should be strengthened. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Republic of Kenya based on the information available on the current outbreak. ',)",14
"("" Local transmission of chikungunya has been confirmed in south eastern France, with four cases diagnosed in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region as of 23 August 2017. In addition, there is one probable case, and eight suspected cases. The date of onset of symptoms of the first confirmed case was 2 August 2017. All four confirmed and one probable case had symptom onset during the period, 2 to 17 August 2017. All 13 patients (four confirmed, one probable and eight suspected) are aged between 3 to 77 years old, and they all are inhabitants of the same district of the commune of Cannet des Maures in Var department, as announced by the Regional Health Authority (ARS). These are not the first reported cases of chikungunya in France. Two autochthonous cases were recorded in the same area in 2010 and 11 cases in Montpellier in 2014. Nevertheless, chikungunya is an emerging disease in southern Europe, and an outbreak is considered unexpected. The vector Aedes albopictus is establishing itself in large part of the Mediterranean basin and beyond. ### Public health response by French national authorities According to the national response plan, the following actions are being taken: * Vector control measures around the house and working locations of the patients. * Blood testing of any suspected case. * Risk communication as coordinated by the regional health agency. The entomological investigation on 10 August 2017 confirmed the presence of Aedes albopictus in the affected area. In addition, blood collection has been postponed in the affected area. ### WHO risk assessment There is a potential risk for international spread. This is based on: * Aedes albopictus being established throughout the Mediterranean basin. * This vector having demonstrated capacity to sustain outbreaks of chikungunya in the past. * The currently affected area being highly touristic particularly in summer months and close to the border with Italy (with established populations of Aedes albopictus). Chikungunya transmission was reported for the first time in Europe in 2007, in an outbreak in north eastern Italy. There were 205 cases recorded during that outbreak and it confirmed that mosquito-borne outbreaks by Aedes albopictus are plausible in Europe. Asymptomatic infection with chikungunya can go undetected and therefore also increases the risk for spread. Additionally, excess rainfall in the affected areas in the coming months, could trigger further increase in transmission as observed in 2014. ### WHO advice #### Prevention of mosquito bites Basic precautions should be taken by people within and travelling to this area of France to prevent mosquito bites during the day. These include the use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin. People should sleep under a mosquito bed net and use air conditioning or window screens to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting. #### Vector control Aedes albopictus thrives in a wide range of water-filled containers, including tree-holes and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as unused vehicle tires, saucers beneath plant pots, rain water barrels and cisterns, and catch basins. Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of these water- filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. During outbreaks, indoor space spraying with insecticides may be used to kill flying mosquitoes along with measures to kill the larvae. WHO also encourages strengthening monitoring of the mosquitoes and implementation of additional control as and when needed through arboviral disease networks within Europe. Awareness should also be raised about re- emerging vector-borne diseases among physicians and through social mobilization efforts in affected communities. #### Blood safety National blood services and/or authorities should monitor epidemiological information and strengthen vigilance to identify any potential transmission of chikungunya virus via transfusion. Appropriate safety precautions in line with measures taken to prevent other mosquito-borne disease transmission via transfusion should be taken based on the epidemiological situation and risk assessment.

"("" On 22 August 2017, the National IHR Focal Point for France notified a confirmed fatal case of yellow fever in a 43-year-old Brazilian woman in French Guiana, with an unknown vaccination status. The patient was hospitalized on 7 August 2017 and died on 9 August 2017 at the Cayenne hospital from fulminant hepatitis. She may have visited a gold mining area near St. Elie (North center of the country). Investigations are currently ongoing in order to identify the patient's travel route. On 21 August 2017, the case was laboratory confirmed at the national reference center for arboviruses, Institut Pasteur Cayenne by RT-PCR. This is the first confirmed case diagnosed in this territory since 1998. In French Guiana, yellow fever is considered endemic. The overall immunization coverage is good as yellow fever vaccination is mandatory but immunization coverage might be low in specific populations like clandestine and illegal workers. Therefore, vaccination catch-up will be implemented in legal and illegal gold prospecting areas. ### Public health response French Guiana health authorities are implementing several public health measures: * An initial investigation was performed and further investigations are ongoing. * Vector control interventions are being implemented, especially in specific zones that the case visited. These include health facilities in Cayenne and Kourou, localities of the interior around Saint Elie, and in the Bas-Oyapock river area. * The feasibility of vaccination catch-up targeting workers in legal and illegal gold mining areas is considered. * Communication and messages on prevention measures for yellow fever are being disseminated in French Guiana, including to people who live in those areas. ### WHO risk assessment Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impacts in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection. French Guiana is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travelers over one year of age. Vaccination coverage in French Guiana is optimal, however, the coverage in some populations such as clandestine workers, in mining areas could be sub- optimal and therefore at risk for yellow fever infections. While the exact place of infection remains under investigation, the most likely geographic area of infection appears to be around the border between French Guiana and Brazil along the Oyapock river. At this stage and according to the preliminary data, this case is not epidemiologically linked to the sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks reported from Brazil since January 2017. Sequencing and comparison with yellow fever virus strains from other countries is needed to understand the potential link between the different outbreaks and the evolution of yellow fever virus. Based on the information currently available regarding epidemiological situation and early public health actions, the potential for large epidemic and international spread exists but is limited and could be further reduced by vaccination. ### WHO advice Advice to travelers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in South America includes: * Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. * Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites. * Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever in general population. * Promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present). This case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with favorable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission. Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against Yellow fever disease and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. WHO, therefore, urges Members States to strengthen the control of immunization status of travelers to all potentially endemic areas. Viraemic returning travelers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities. WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restriction be applied on French Guiana based on the information available for this event. "",)",1
"(' As of 26 September, 183 cases have been notified to the Lazio Region of Italy, which includes the coastal areas of Anzio and Latina as well as the city of Rome. Of the notified cases, 109 are confirmed and 74 additional cases are being investigated (all with an epidemiological link to the Lazio Region). Three more confirmed cases have also been notified from other areas with a travel history to Anzio. The date of onset of symptoms of the first case was on 26 June 2017. ### Public health response The following public health measures described in the Italian National Chikungunya Surveillance and Response Plan are implemented: * Disinfestation and vector control measures in the Anzio and Rome areas; * Communication to the population about chikungunya and information on protection against mosquito bites. Ministry of Health’s website has pages about chikungunya which can be found at the link below; * Measures to prevent transmission through blood transfusion; * Information and guidelines for health care practitioners to manage patients. The National Health Institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) issued a public statement on 8 September 2017 concerning the outbreak. On 28 September 2017 the Ministry of Health issued new recommendations to strengthen surveillance and control activities at national level, including disinfestation at ports and airports (see link below). ### WHO risk assessment There is a risk for further transmission. This is due to: * Aedes albopictus being established throughout the Mediterranean basin; * this vector having demonstrated the capacity to sustain outbreaks of chikungunya in the past; and * the area of the current case being highly populated and touristic particularly in summer months. The disease mostly occurs in Africa, Asia, Americas and the Indian subcontinent. In 2007, transmission was reported for the first time in Europe, in the Emilia Romagna region of north-eastern Italy. There were 217 laboratory confirmed cases during this outbreak and it demonstrated that mosquito-borne outbreaks by Aedes albopictus are possible in Europe. Currently, there is another ongoing autochthonous outbreak in Var Department, France that started in early August 2017. ### WHO advice #### Personal protection Basic precautions should be taken by people within and travelling to this area of Italy. These include wearing long sleeves and pants, use of repellents, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting vectors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin. People should sleep under a mosquito bed net and use air conditioning or window screens to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting. #### Vector control The Aedes albopictus species thrives in a wide range of water-filled containers, including tree-holes and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as unused vehicle tires, saucers beneath plant pots, rain water barrels and cisterns, and catch basins. Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of these natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected communities, and strengthening monitoring of the vector mosquito. During outbreaks, indoor space spraying with insecticides may be performed to kill flying mosquitoes along with killing the immature larvae in water-filled containers through source reduction. ### About chikungunya Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. Hence the virus can cause acute, subacute or chronic disease. There is no cure for the disease and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya. ',)",183
"(' On 23 August 2017, a 31-year-old male from Tamatave, visiting Ankazobe District in central highlands, developed malaria-like symptoms. On 27 August, he developed respiratory symptoms during his journey in a shared public taxi from Ankazobe District to Tamatave (via Antananarivo). His condition worsened and he died. His body was prepared for a funeral at the nearest hospital, Moramanga District Hospital, without safety procedures. Additionally, 31 people who came into contact with this case either through direct contact with the primary case or had other epidemiological links, became ill, and four cases of them died. The outbreak was detected on 11 September, following the death of a 47-year- old woman from Antananarivo, who was admitted to a hospital with respiratory failure caused by pneumonic plague. The public health authorities Direction de la Veille Sanitaire et de la Surveillance Epidémiologique (DVSSE) immediately launched field investigations. As of 28 September 2017, a total of 51 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) of pneumonic plague, including 12 deaths were reported in the country. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar by polymerase chain reaction test and using rapid diagnostic test. In addition to the 51 suspected, probable and confirmed cases of pneumonic plague, and during the same period another 53 cases of bubonic plague including seven deaths have been reported throughout the country. One case of septicaemic plague has also been identified and they were not directly linked to the outbreak. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases have been provided access to treatment at no cost. Active case finding and contact tracing are on-going and all pneumonic cases are being isolated and treated, and all contacts are receiving chemoprophylaxis. There are additional ongoing key public health response measures which include: * Ongoing investigation of new cases. * Strengthening of the epidemiological surveillance in the affected and surrounding districts, including contact identification, administration of chemoprophylaxis, and monitoring close contacts of pneumonic plague cases. * Disinsection of affected areas, including rodent and vector control. * Raising awareness of the population about prevention and actions after exposure. * Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information including infection control measures, and implementation of safe burial practices. ### WHO risk assessment Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals from their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or by inhalation. There are three forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. * Bubonic plague (known in mediaeval Europe as the \'Black Death\') is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Yersinia pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a ""bubo"". At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with puss. * Pneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal. * Septicaemic plague occurs when infection spreads through the bloodstream, following a bubonic or a pneumonic plague. Plague can be a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio of 30–100% if left untreated. The pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early, is especially contagious and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air. Plague is an endemic disease in Madagascar; cases of bubonic plague are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April). However, the ongoing pneumonic plague event has been reported in a non-endemic area and in densely populated coastal cities for the first time. Pneumonic plague is a form of plague that is transmissible from person-to- person, with a potential to trigger severe epidemics if inadequately controlled. Detection of this outbreak occurred more than two weeks after the first case died during which cases travelled to different parts of the country, including the capital Antananarivo. Therefore, the overall risk at the national level is high. The overall regional risk is moderate due to frequent flights to neighboring Indian Ocean islands. The global risk is low. ### WHO advice #### Prevention and control measures Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. The most rapid and effective method for controlling fleas is to apply an appropriate insecticide formulated as a dust or low-volume spray. People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague. Important prevention and control measures include: * Find and stop the source of infection. * Protect health workers: inform and train them on infection prevention and control. * Isolate: patients with pneumonic plague. They should be isolated so as not to infect others via air droplets. * Surveillance: identify and monitor close contacts of pneumonic plague patients and give them a seven day chemoprophylaxis. * Obtain specimens which should be carefully collected and sent to labs for testing. * Ensure safe burial practices. #### Treatment Untreated plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time. #### Travel advice WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information. It is recommended to provide information at the ports of entry (airports, seaports) of Madagascar about the disease and the necessary protection measures required.

"(' From 23 August to 30 September 2017, a total of 73 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of pneumonic plague, including 17 deaths have been reported in Madagascar. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar by polymerase chain reaction test or using rapid diagnostic test. The outbreak started following the death of a 31-year-old male from Ankazobe District in the Central Highlands (Hauts-Plateaux), a plague-endemic area. Since then, the Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar enhanced field investigations, contact tracing, surveillance, and monitoring all close contacts. As of 30 September, 10 cities have reported pneumonic plague cases and the three most affected districts include: the capital city and suburbs of Antananarivo (27 cases, 7 deaths), Toamasina (18 cases, 5 deaths), and Faratshio (13 cases, 1 death). On 27 September, during the Coupe des clubs champions de l\'océan Indien (a basketball championship held between 23 September and 1 October), a Seychellois basketball player, died in a hospital in Madagascar by pneumonic plague. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar immediately started an investigation and there is ongoing contact tracing of all the individuals he came into contact with. Chemoprophylaxis as a precautionary measure has been given to all close contacts. In addition to the 73 cases of pneumonic plague, from 1 August to 30 September, 58 cases of bubonic plague including seven deaths have been reported. One additional case of septicaemic plague has also been reported, and one case where the type is not specified. ### Public health response The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases have been provided access to treatment at no cost. There are public health response measures which include: * Ongoing investigation of new cases * Isolation and treatment of all pneumonic cases * Active finding and tracing of contacts and provision of chemoprophylaxis * Strengthening of the epidemiological surveillance in the affected and surrounding districts * Disinsection of affected areas, including rodent and vector control * Raising public awareness on prevention * Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures * Providing information about infection control measures during burial practices ### WHO risk assessment Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas.

People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague. Important prevention and control measures are primarily intended to reduce human transmission and avoid increase in epidemic. These include: * Advising the public to take all necessary precautions against flea bites and to not pick up or touch dead animals * Implementing measures to control rodents hosts of Yersinia pestis (plague bacillus), especially rats * Avoiding direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague * Early presentation to health care - go to the closest health center in the event of suspicious symptoms * Health workers and people who are in direct contact with pneumonic plague patients must wear personal protective equipment * Health workers should receive a chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics as long as they are exposed * Safe management and burial of deceased cases #### Treatment Rapid diagnosis and treatment is essential to reduce complications and fatality. Effective treatment methods enable plague patients to be cured, if diagnosed in time. These methods include the administration of antibiotics as Aminoglycosides, Fluoroquinolones, Sulfonamides and supportive therapy. #### Travel advice Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information. International travellers should be informed about the current plague outbreak and that plague is endemic in Madagascar. Travellers should also be aware that Madagascar is endemic for malaria and should consider the antimalarial prophylaxis recommended by WHO when travelling to Madagascar (see link below). The risk of infection withYersinia pestis for international travellers to Madagascar is generally low. However, travellers in rural areas of plague- endemic regions may be at risk, particularly if camping or hunting or if contact with rodents takes place. In addition, travellers to previously non- endemic regions from where cases of pneumonic plague have been recently reported should avoid crowded areas, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague.* Travellers should avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. Travellers can protect against flea bites using repellent products for personal protection against mosquitoes, which may equally be protective against fleas and other blood-feeding insects. Formulations (lotions or sprays) based on the following active ingredients are recommended by the WHO Pesticides Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) : DEET, IR3535, Icaridin (KBR3023) or Picaridin. WHO guidance for control of rodent fleas that transmit bubonic plague can be found here: In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with plague cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from infected fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Travellers should immediately notify health care personnel or authority in case of contact and potential exposure to pneumonic plague patients or other high risk exposures and seek medical advice regarding chemoprophylaxis.** Travellers should avoid self-administration with antibiotics as prophylaxis, unless recommended by medical professionals. Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms, and if symptoms appear, they should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar. * * * ##### CORRIGENDUM *Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence under the ""Travel Advice"" section on 3 October 2017. **Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence under the ""Travel Advice"" section on 9 October 2017 ',)",131
"(' On 17 October 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Kween District, Eastern Uganda. The Ministry for Health officially declared the outbreak on 19 October 2017. As of 24 October, five cases have been reported – one confirmed case, one probable case with an epidemiological link to the confirmed case, and three suspected cases including two health workers. Chronologically, the first case-patient (probable case) reported was a male in his 30s, who worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave with a heavy presence of bats. On 20 September, he was admitted to a local health centre with high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, and did not respond to antimalarial treatment. As his condition deteriorated, he was transferred to the referral hospital in the neighbouring district, where he died the same day. No samples were collected. He was given a traditional burial, which was attended by an estimated 200 people. The sister (confirmed case) of the first case-patient nursed him and participated in the burial rituals. She became ill and was admitted to the same health centre on 5 October 2017 with fever and bleeding manifestations. She was subsequently transferred to the same referral hospital, where she died. She was given a traditional burial. Posthumous samples were collected and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). On 17 October, Marburg virus infection was confirmed at UVRI by RT-PCR and it was immediately notified to the Ministry of Health. The third case-patient (suspected case) is the brother of the first two cases. He assisted in the transport of his sister to the hospital, and subsequently became symptomatic. He refused to be admitted to hospital, and returned to the community. His whereabouts are currently not known though there is an ongoing effort to find him. Two health workers who were in contact with the confirmed case have developed symptoms consistent with Marburg virus disease and are under investigation (suspected cases). Laboratory results to rule out Marburg virus disease are pending. Contact tracing and follow-up activities have been initiated. As of 23 October, 155 contacts including 66 who had contact with the first case and 89 who had contact with the second case-patient have been listed in the two affected districts, including 44 health care workers. The number of family and community contacts is still being investigated. ### Public health response * The Ugandan Ministry of Health has rapidly responded to the outbreak, with support from WHO and partners. A rapid response field team was deployed to the two affected districts within 24 hours of the confirmation. * To coordinate response activities, the National Task Force has convened, an Incident Management System (IMS) framework implemented with an Incident Manager appointed, a District Task Force has been established, and an emergency rapid response plan has been developed. * Marburg virus disease response activities have been initiated, including surveillance, active case search, contact tracing and follow-up, as well as monitoring within affected communities and healthcare centres. * Personal protective equipment has been deployed in the affected districts. Healthcare workers have been put on high alert and training sessions are planned, including a thorough review of infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols and capacity. An isolation facility is being prepared at the health centre and the hospital. * Training of teams for safe and dignified burials has been conducted in affected districts. * Community engagement and awareness campaigns are ongoing to reduce stigma, encourage reporting and early healthcare seeking behaviours, and acceptance of prevention measures. Information, education and communication materials and messages have been updated and are being produced. * International partners and stakeholders have been engaged at country level, and internationally to provide support and technical assistance for the response as needed. WHO has deployed additional staff, and six viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) kits. Funding has been provided from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies to ensure immediate support and scale up the response. WHO has alerted partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and is coordinating international support for the response. * UNICEF is assisting with communication activities, and community engagement. * Médecins Sans Frontières has deployed to support setting up of treatment centres. ### WHO risk assessment Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (case fatality rate: 23–90%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats). Candidate experimental treatments and vaccine are being reviewed for potential clinical trials. Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks including Marburg virus disease. Cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been documented during: * 2007 – 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda District, Western Uganda; * 2008 – 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda; * 2012 – 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda; and * 2014 – 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda. As of 24 October, five cases have been identified – one confirmed case, one probable case, and three suspected cases, and the outbreak remains localised. Ugandan health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies is a challenge for the response. In addition, hospitalised cases were handled in general wards without strict infection control precautions, and one probable case refused to be hospitalised for a period of time. The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread. These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon including the caves and surrounding areas should be noted and appropriate advice given and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low. ### WHO advice Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply infection control precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and body fluids, and unprotected contact with possibly contaminated environment. Surveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case search must be strengthened within all affected health zones. Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus, are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include: * Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bats colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks). * Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home. * Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centres and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event. Travellers to the Mount Elgon bat caves are advised to avoid exposure to bats and contact with non-human primates, and, to the extent possible, to wear gloves and protecting clothing, including masks . For further information on Marburg virus disease and prevention and control measures is available in the WHO Marburg virus disease factsheet. ',)",5
"(' On 8 and 15 September 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of two additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. ### Details of the case-patients On 8 September 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient is a 67-year-old male from Hunan province who developed symptoms on 27 August 2017, and was admitted to hospital on 2 September due to severe pneumonia. He was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. On 15 September 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient is a 54-year-old male from Liaoning province who developed symptoms on 3 September 2017, and was admitted to hospital on 11 September due to severe pneumonia. He was reported to have had occupational exposure to live poultry on a farm. To date, a total of 1564 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013. ### Public health response The Chinese government assessment is that although newly infected human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported less frequently in recent weeks, it is still likely that sporadic cases will continue to occur in China taking into consideration the previous epidemic situation and recent patterns. Thus the government at national and local level continues to take preventive measures which include: * Guiding the provinces to strengthen surveillance to ensure timely and effective detection and response to outbreaks. * Guiding the provinces to make use of the present low-incidence period to review the prevention and control efforts taken, to facilitate implementation of long-term measures. * Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection. * The agricultural sector has started to extensively vaccinate poultry with influenza A(H5) and A(H7) bivalent vaccines. * The government has cautioned provinces that infection prevention and control cannot be treated lightly, and that they should stay alert to ensure that cases can be identified and managed in a timely and effective manner. ### WHO risk assessment As seen in previous years, the number of weekly reported cases has decreased over the summer months. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the geographical distribution in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) however has been greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sector remain crucial. Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner. ### WHO advice WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible, avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions, with regard to this event. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in, or soon after returning from, an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns; ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005; and continue national health preparedness actions.

"("" Since August 2017, Madagascar is experiencing a large outbreak of plague affecting major cities and other non-endemic areas. From 1 August through 30 October 2017, a total of 1801 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 127 deaths, have been reported by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to WHO. Of these, 1111 (62%) were clinically classified as pneumonic plague, including 257 (23%) confirmed, 374 (34%) probable and 480 (43%) suspected cases. In addition to the pneumonic cases, 261 (15%) cases of bubonic plague, one case of septicaemic plague and 428 cases (24%) where the type has not yet been specified, have been reported (Figure 1). As of 30 October, 51 of 114 districts of Madagascar have been affected (Figure 2 and 3). Since the beginning of the outbreak, 71 healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died. Laboratory confirmation of plague is being conducted by the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar. Twenty-three isolates of Yersinia pestis have been cultured and all are sensitive to antibiotics recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague. Since the second week of October 2017, there has been a decline in the number of new cases (Figure 4). There is also a decrease in the number of patients hospitalized due to suspicion of plague. Due to enhanced surveillance and ongoing investigations the cumulative number of cases continues to increase, however, some of the cases are not recently infected. In Madagascar, the number of cases of plague is highest during the period of September through April. It is therefore important that control measures continue through to the end of April 2018. Eighty-three percent of 6492 individuals identified as contacts of a person suspected of having plague have completed follow-up monitoring, which includes a seven day follow-up and a course of prophylactic antibiotics. On 30 October 2017, 95% of the 972 contacts currently under follow-up were reached by field teams and have been provided with antibiotics as precautionary measure. #### Figure 1. Confirmed, probable and suspected plague cases reported in Madagascar by clinical classification and date of illness onset, from 1 August through 30 October 2017 (n=1506)1 1 Date of onset is missing for 295 cases. #### Figure 2.

Epidemic curve of reported confirmed, probable and suspect pneumonic plague by date of illness onset in Madagascar, from 1 August through 30 October 2017 (n=1053)2 2 Date of onset is missing for 58 cases. ### Public health response The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the health response, with the support of WHO, and other agencies and partners. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar has activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases and contacts have been provided access to treatment or prophylactic antibiotics at no cost. Public health response measures include: * Investigation of new cases * Isolation and treatment of all pneumonic cases * Enhanced case finding * Active finding, tracing and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibiotics * Strengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districts * Disinsection, including rodent and vector control * Raising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plague * Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures and protection from infection * Providing information about infection control measures during burial practices. Enhanced measures for exit screening have been implemented at the International Airport in Antananarivo. These measures include: filling a special departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers, and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated using a rapid diagnostic test and notified according to the response alert protocol. Symptomatic passengers are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and L'Institut de veille sanitaire/ Santé publique France (InVS/SPF) is providing technical support at the airport. Nine countries and overseas territories in the African region (Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La Réunion (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania) have been identified as priority countries for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of their trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries are implementing readiness activities including increased public awareness of plague, enhancing surveillance for the disease particularly at points of entry and prepositioning of equipment and supplies. ### WHO risk assessment While the declining trend in new plague case reports and reduction in hospitalizations due to plague is encouraging, WHO expects more cases of plague to be reported from Madagascar until the typical plague season ends in April 2018. Sustaining ongoing operations, including active case finding and treatment, comprehensive contact identification, follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and safe and dignified burials is crucial during the outbreak and through the plague season as it is critical to minimize bubonic plague infections and human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague. Based on available information and response measures implemented to date, WHO estimates the risk of potential further spread of the plague outbreak at national level remains high. The risk of international spread is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures and advice to traveller to Madagascar, and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. The overall global risk is considered to be low. WHO is re-evaluating the risk assessment based on the evolution of the outbreak and information from response activities. Advice on prevention and control measures, treatment options have been provided to Madagascar and to priority countries in the region. For further information on plague and the latest information about the plague outbreak in Madagascar please see WHO Plague website and the Madagascar Plague Outbreak Situation Reports website. ### WHO advice on travel Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the information available. International travellers arriving in Madagascar should be informed about the current plague outbreak and the necessary protection measures. Travellers should protect themselves against flea bites, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood- tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Travellers should avoid self-medication, even if for prophylaxis. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms. If symptoms appear, travellers should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar. "",)",1801
"("" ### Summary of situation * Burkina Faso has been reporting an increase in the number of dengue fever cases in health facilities since week 31 of 2017 (week ending on 6 August 2017). The Ministry of Health officially declared the outbreak on 28 September 2017. As of 3 November 2017, a total of 9 029 (suspected, probable or confirmed) cases and 18 deaths (CFR= 0.2%) were reported throughout the country. Of the total cases reported, 5773 (64%) were probable, with a positive result for dengue by the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). During week 43 of 2017, 2 566 cases (including 1427 probable) were reported across all regions. Out of 241 samples referred for PCR testing at the Viral Haemorrhagic fever (VHF) reference lab of the Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, 141 (59%) were positive. Further characterization of 72 samples has identified three dengue virus serotypes: DENV-2 (58 positives), DENV-3 (12 positives) and DENV-1 (2 positives). Cases are currently reported in all the 13 health regions of the country, with 60.8% of cases reported in the central region, particularly in the city of Ouagadougou. ### Public health response * The National Epidemic Management Committee has been activated to coordinate response activities. * Strengthening the epidemiological surveillance, and putting in place an Early Warning System that provides daily notification of cases in Ouagadougou and weekly in the other provinces. * Provision of free medical care and treatment for severe cases in all hospitals (Regional and District hospitals). 15 000 RDTs distributed to reference health centers. * Development and dissemination of a national dengue clinical management algorithm. * Delivery and dissemination of key awareness and prevention measures through radio and television programs. * Periodic shipment of samples to the VHF laboratory of the Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso. * Implementation of intensive vector control interventions targeting larva and adult mosquitoes through. * Elimination of mosquito breeding sites which was carried out by community volunteers in Ouagadougou; * Distribution of 1 500 Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) to hospitals; * Ongoing in-door spraying to control adult mosquitoes at the household level. ### WHO risk assessment This outbreak is occurring in the context of an improved but still limited dengue surveillance system in Burkina Faso. The weekly case incidence has been on the rise since the detection of the outbreak in week 31 and is likely underestimated. The epidemic has already spread to twelve of the country's thirteen health zones and many public health facilities do not have access to dengue fever diagnostics (RDTs). Burkina Faso experienced an outbreak of dengue in 2016 which was caused by DENV-2. In the current outbreak, three serotypes were identified: DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. This could lead to the occurrence of more severe cases, which may not be captured by the surveillance system due to under-reporting from private clinics and healthcare centers in peripheral districts. The existence of multiple mosquito breeding sites after the rainy season may favor the continued presence of mosquito populations in the affected communities In particular, the peripheral districts of cities in Burkina Faso are characterized by poor sanitation and the accumulation of rubbish dump sites, tires and used containers which provide productive breeding sites for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (the primary vector for dengue). ### WHO advice WHO recommends adequate and timely case management dengue cases. Surveillance should be strengthened within all affected health zones. Key public health communication messages should be provided. Integrated Vector Management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations and minimize individual exposures. This should include both vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management, and chemical and biological control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. For further information, see: WHO recommends that countries should consider the introduction of the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV only in geographic settings (national or subnational) where epidemiological data indicate a high burden of disease. Complete recommendations may be found in the WHO position paper on dengue vaccines: WHO advises against any restriction on travel and trade to Burkina Faso or the affected district based on the available information. * * * CORRIGENDUM: Updates were made to the numbers and text in the first 3 paragraphs.

"(' On 17 October 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO of a confirmed outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Kween District, Eastern Uganda. The Ministry for Health officially declared the outbreak on 19 October 2017. As of 3 November, the three cases that have been previously reported (two confirmed and one probable case, the latter being the index case) have died, thus, resulting in an overall case-fatality rate of 100%. The cases were epidemiologically linked and come from one family. The second confirmed case travelled to Kenya, prior to his death. Contact tracing and active case search is ongoing in Kween in Kapchorwa district in Uganda, as well as in Kitale district and West Pokot in Kenya. On 4 November a high risk contact of the second confirmed case, a health care worker in Kween developed symptoms and was admitted to the treatment facility in Kween. Additionally, one close contact of the second confirmed case has been reported to have travelled to Kampala. The Kampala City Authority has sent a team to the village she is reported to be visiting to trace this contact and continue 21 days follow-up. ### Public health response * The Ugandan Ministry of Health continues to proactively respond to the outbreak with support from WHO and partners. * Contact tracing is ongoing, as well as active case search in health facilities and at community level. Reported deaths are also investigated for Marburg before burial and suspicious deaths accorded safe and dignified burials. * An isolation and treatment unit was set-up in Kapchorwa with logistical support from WHO, UNICEF, and MSF. A complete triage protocol has been implemented. * Social mobilization and risk communication are ongoing. With the support from Red Cross volunteers, UNICEF and WHO communication experts, over 4,000 community members have received information on MVD. * Psychosocial support specialists have been deployed to Kween and counselling sessions are being conducted for family members of the deceased Marburg cases, health workers, and other community members. * Guided tours of the Marburg treatment units in Kapchorwa and Kween were organized in order to dispel fear of the treatment center and rumours of wrong practices by healthcare workers that cause death of admitted patients. * A cross-border meeting between Uganda and Kenya health authorities is scheduled for 7th November 2017 in Kapchorwa, and cross-border surveillance activities are ongoing. * Kenya Marburg virus disease outbreak contingency plan and the public health EOC have been activated and preparedness measures have started. * 2000 Personal Protective Equipment sets have been dispatched by WHO and shipped to Trans Nzoia County, Kenya. * Blood specimens were collected and have been dispatched to Nairobi’s KEMRI Laboratory * A temporary treatment center (Kaisangat Health center) has been identified and the Kenya Red Cross Society is recruiting and re-orienting nurses to manage the MVD treatment centre. * UNICEF is assisting with communication activities, and community engagement. * MSF-France has deployed to support setting up of treatment centres in Uganda (Kapchorwa and Kaproron) and Kenya (Kaisangat). ### WHO risk assessment Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (case fatality rate: 23–90%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats). Candidate experimental treatments and vaccine are being reviewed for potential clinical trials. Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring Ebola and Marburg virus (MVD) disease outbreaks. MVD cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been documented during: * 2007 – 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda District, Western Uganda; * 2008 – 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda; * 2012 – 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda; and * 2014 – 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda. Currently, three cases have been identified; two confirmed and one probable case. The second confirmed case travelled to Kenya prior to his death, but so far no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed outside of Uganda. Ugandan health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Kenyan health authorities have activated the contingency plan and the public health EOC and have started preparedness measures. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies is a challenge for the response. The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread. These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon including the caves and surrounding areas should be noted and appropriate advice given and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low. ### WHO advice Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids of infected symptomatic persons, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply infection control precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and body fluids, and unprotected contact with possibly contaminated environment. Surveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case search must be strengthened within all affected health zones. Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus, are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include: * Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bats colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks). * Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home. * Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centres and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event. Travelers to the Mount Elgon bat caves are advised to avoid exposure to fruit bats and contact with non-human primates, and, to the extent possible, to wear gloves and protecting clothing, including masks.

"(' On 17 October 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO of a confirmed outbreak of Marburg Virus Disease in Kween District, Eastern Uganda. The MoH officially declared the outbreak on 19 October 2017. As of 14 November, three cases have been reported including two confirmed cases, and one probable case. All three cases have died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 100%. The cases were epidemiologically linked and all belong to the same family. Chronologically, the first case (probable) was a 35-years-old herdsman who frequently hunted near the area of Kaptum, known for its bat-infested caves. He was admitted to hospital on 20 September with Marburg-like symptoms and died five days later. The first confirmed case was the sister and caretaker of the first case. The second confirmed case was the brother of the first two cases, who died on 26 October 2017 and had a safe and dignified burial on the same day. Prior to his death, the second confirmed case travelled to Kenya where he visited his relatives in West Pokot County, as well as a traditional healer in Trans Nzoia County. On 29 October 2017, the Ugandan MoH notified WHO and the Kenyan MoH of these high-risk contacts. The traditional healer tested negative for Marburg virus disease on repeated blood specimen analyses performed at the Kenyan Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Nairobi. She and her family were monitored for 21 days. The two relatives from West Pokot, as well as other contacts in the same county, also completed their 21 days of follow up. Active case search, death surveillance, safe and dignified burials and community mobilization are ongoing in Kween and Kapchorwa districts. In Uganda, of the 339 contacts listed, 283 have completed 21 days of follow-up and 56 are still being monitored. Contact follow-up is ongoing in Kween for the 56 contacts, while In Kapchorwa District, all the listed contacts have completed the 21 days follow-up period. All remaining contacts are expected to complete 21 days of follow up on 16 November 2017. Enhanced surveillance activities will continue until 7 December 2017. ### Public health response * The Ugandan MoH continues to proactively respond to the outbreak with support from WHO and partners. * Contact tracing and active case search in health facilities and at the community level are ongoing. On 14 November 2017, 56 contacts were still under follow up. Reported deaths are also investigated for Marburg before burial and suspicious deaths are buried according to safe and dignified burial protocols. * Two Marburg treatment centers have been set up in Kapchorwa hospital and Kaproron with logistical support from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) France, UNICEF and WHO. * Social mobilization and risk communication are ongoing. Over 12 000 community members have received information on Marburg virus disease with the support from Red Cross volunteers, UNICEF and WHO communication experts. * Psychosocial support specialists have been deployed to Kween and counselling sessions are being conducted for family members of the deceased Marburg cases, health workers, and other community members. * Guided tours of the Marburg treatment units in Kapchorwa and Kaproron were organized in order to dispel fear of the treatment centers and rumours of wrong practices by healthcare workers that cause deaths among admitted patients. * On 7 November 2017, a cross-border meeting between Uganda and Kenya health authorities was organized to strengthen cross-border surveillance in Kapchorwa, and cross-border surveillance activities are ongoing. * The Kenyan Marburg virus disease outbreak contingency plan and the public health Emergency Operations Center have been activated and preparedness measures have started. * Two thousand Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits have been dispatched by WHO and shipped to Trans Nzoia County, Kenya. * A temporary treatment center (Kaisangat Health center) has been identified and the Kenya Red Cross Society is recruiting and re-orienting nurses to manage the Marburg Virus Disease treatment centre. * UNICEF is assisting with communication activities and community engagement. ### WHO risk assessment Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (CFR: 23 to 90%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats). Candidate experimental therapeutics are being reviewed for potential clinical trials. As of 15 November, the current outbreak has affected three cases, all of whom have died. One of the confirmed cases travelled to Kenya prior to his death. However, so far no secondary case has been confirmed outside of Uganda. Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring Ebola and Marburg virus disease outbreaks. Cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Kenya on the other hand has limited experience and has been facing a healthcare worker strike which could delay any public health response. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Uganda and Kenya may increase the risk of cross-border spread. Ugandan health authorities have responded quickly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Kenyan health authorities have activated the contingency plan and the public health EOC and have started preparedness measures. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies was a challenge for the response.

These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon, including to the caves and surrounding areas, should be considered as part of the response, and appropriate advice provided, and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low. ### WHO advice Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids, of infected symptomatic persons, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed.

People who have died from Marburg virus disease should be buried promptly, safely, and with dignity. ### Restrictions of international travel WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event. Travelers to the Mount Elgon bat caves are advised to avoid exposure to fruit bats and contact with non-human primates, and, to the extent possible, to wear gloves and protecting clothing, including masks.

"("" Since 1 August 2017, Madagascar has been experiencing a large outbreak of plague. As of 10 November 2017, a total of 2119 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 171 deaths (case fatality rate: 8%), have been reported by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to WHO. From 1 August through 10 November 2017, 1618 (76%) cases and 72 deaths have been clinically classified as pneumonic plague, including 365 (23%) confirmed, 573 (35%) probable and 680 (42%) suspected cases. In addition to the pneumonic cases, 324 (15%) cases of bubonic plague, one case of septicaemic plague, and 176 unspecified cases (8%), have been reported to WHO (Figure 1). Eighty-two healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died. #### Figure 1: Number of confirmed, probable and suspected plague cases in Madagascar reported by date of illness onset from 1 August through 10 November 2017 (n=2119)1 1 Date of onset is missing for 295 cases From 1 August through 10 November, 16 (out of 22) regions of Madagascar have reported cases. Analamanga Region has been the most affected, reporting 72% of the overall cases (Figures 2 and 3). #### Figure 2: Geographical distribution of confirmed and probable pneumonic plague cases in Madagascar from 1 August through 12 November 2017 #### Figure 3: Geographical distribution of confirmed and probable bubonic plague cases in Madagascar from 1 August through 12 November 2017 As of 10 November 2017, 218 out of 243 (90%) contacts under follow-up were reached and provided with prophylactic antibiotics. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 7122 contacts were identified, 6729 (95%) of whom have completed their 7-day follow up and a course of prophylactic antibiotics. Only nine contacts developed symptoms and became suspected cases. Laboratory confirmation of plague is being conducted by the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, National WHO Collaborating Center for plague in Madagascar. Twenty-five isolates of Yersinia pestis have been cultured and all are sensitive to antibiotics recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague. The number of new cases and hospitalizations of patients due to plague is declining in Madagascar. The last confirmed bubonic case was reported on 24 October and the last confirmed pneumonic case was reported on 28 October. Since plague is endemic to parts of Madagascar, WHO expects more cases to be reported until the end of the typical plague season in April 2018. It is therefore important that control measures continue through to the end of the plague season. ### Public health response The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the health response, with the support of WHO and other agencies and partners. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar has activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases and contacts have been provided access to treatment or prophylactic antibiotics at no cost to themselves. Public health response measures include: * Investigation of new cases * Isolation and treatment of all pneumonic cases * Enhanced case finding * Active finding, tracing and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibiotics * Strengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districts * Disinsection, including rodent and vector control * Raising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plague * Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures and protection from infection * Providing information about infection control measures during burial practices. Enhanced measures for exit screening have been implemented at the International Airport in Antananarivo. These measures include: filling a special departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers, and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated using a rapid diagnostic test and notified according to the response alert protocol. Symptomatic passengers are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team, consisting of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and L'Institut de veille sanitaire/ Santé publique France (InVS/SPF), is providing technical support at the airport. Nine countries and overseas territories in the African region (Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La Réunion (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania) have been identified as priority countries for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of their trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries are implementing readiness activities, including increased public awareness of plague, enhancing surveillance for the disease (particularly at points of entry), and prepositioning of equipment and supplies. ### WHO risk assessment Since mid-October, the number of new cases of plague, the number of hospitalizations of patients due to plague, and the number of geographic districts reporting plague has decreased. While the declining trend in new plague case reports and reduction in hospitalizations due to plague are encouraging signs, WHO expects more cases of plague to be reported from Madagascar until the typical plague season ends in April 2018. The decline in case reports suggests that the epidemic phase of the outbreak is ending, however sustaining ongoing operations is critical to minimize bubonic plague infections and human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague. The trend in the number of new cases of plague has been declining for more than a month, indicating that measures taken to contain the outbreak have been effective. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Madagascar and other partners to maintain ongoing outbreak control efforts, including active case finding and treatment, comprehensive contact identification, follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and safe and dignified burials through this outbreak and the plague season into 2018, and to outline a longer term strategy for plague preparedness and control. Since the beginning of this outbreak, the vast majority of cases, and more than 7000 contact persons, have been treated and have recovered. As of 15 November 2017, only 12 people are hospitalized for plague. There has been no international spread outside the country. Based on available information and response measures implemented to date, WHO estimates the risk of potential further spread of the plague outbreak at national level remains high. The risk of international spread is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures and advice to travellers to Madagascar, and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. The overall global risk is considered to be low. WHO is re-evaluating the risk assessment based on the evolution of the outbreak and information from response activities. Advice on prevention and control measures and treatment options has been provided to Madagascar and to priority countries in the region. ### WHO travel advice Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar. To date, there are no reported cases related to international travel. International travellers arriving in Madagascar should be informed about the current plague outbreak and the necessary protection measures. Travellers should protect themselves against flea bites, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood- tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Travellers should avoid self-medication, even if for prophylaxis. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms. If symptoms appear, travellers should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar. "",)",2119
"("" From the 1 August through 22 November 2017, a total of 2348 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 202 deaths (case fatality rate 8.6 %), were reported by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to WHO. There were 1791 cases of pneumonic plague, of which 22% were confirmed, 34% were probable, and 44% were suspected. In addition to pneumonic cases, there were reports of 341 cases of bubonic plague, one case of septicaemic plague and 215 cases with type unspecified. #### Figure 1: Number of confirmed, probable and suspected plague cases in Madagascar reported by date of illness onset from 1 August through 22 November 2017 In total, 81 healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died. Since the beginning of the outbreak, cases of pneumonic and bubonic plague have been detected in 55 out of 114 districts (48%), including non-endemic areas and major cities. Analamanga Region has been the most affected, with 68% of the cumulative reported cases. #### Figure 2: Geographical distribution of confirmed and probable pneumonic plague cases in Madagascar from 1 August through 22 November 2017 #### Figure 3: Geographical distribution of confirmed and probable bubonic plague cases in Madagascar from 1 August through 22 November 2017 All contacts identified (7289) during this outbreak have completed their course of prophylactic antibiotics. Eleven contacts developed symptoms compatible with plague and were classified as suspect cases. All contacts had completed their follow up. The Institut Pasteur Madagascar has cultured 33 isolates of Yersinia pestis, which were all sensitive to the antibiotics recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague. Plague is endemic in some areas of Madagascar and additional cases of plague may occur, at least until the end of the plague season in April 2018. It is therefore important that control measures continue through the end of the plague season. ### Public health response The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response, with the support of WHO, the Institute Pasteur Madagascar, and other agencies, stakeholders, and partners. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina to coordinate the outbreak response efforts. All cases and contacts have been provided treatment or prophylactic antibiotics at no cost to themselves. The public health response measures have included: * Strengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districts, and enhanced case finding * Rapid investigation of new cases * Sample collection, referral and testing * Isolation and treatment of all pneumonic cases, as well as treatment of bubonic cases * Active finding, tracing and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibiotics * Disinsection, including rodent and vector control * Raising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plague * Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures and protection from infection * Providing information about infection control measures during burial practices. WHO has coordinated and mobilised regional and global partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to support the outbreak response and will continue work with partners to ensure further rapid response support as needed. Working together, the Ministry of Health, WHO, GOARN, and other partners have trained more than 1800 community health workers for contact tracing, about 300 doctors as contact tracing supervisors and has established rapid response teams for case investigation. The IFRC, UNICEF and USAID have supported case management, including establishment of plague treatment centres. Laboratory confirmation of plague cases is conducted by the Institute Pasteur of Madagascar (IPM). WHO and IPM established a system for specimen collection and referral from peripheral areas to the IPM laboratory to strengthen laboratory capacity for testing and confirmation. Enhanced measures for exit screening have been implemented at the International Airports in Antananarivo and Nocibé, to avoid the international spread of pneumonic plague cases. These measures included: filling a special departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers, and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated using a rapid diagnostic test and notified according to the response alert protocol. Symptomatic passengers are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team, consisting of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and L'Institut de veille sanitaire/ Santé publique France (InVS/SPF), provided technical support at the airport to establish exit screening. WHO and partners will support the MOH to re-evaluate the need for continuity of the exit screening and will implement appropriate recommendations. Nine countries and overseas territories in the African region (Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La Réunion (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania) had been identified as priority countries for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of their trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries have been implementing readiness activities, including increased public awareness of plague, enhancing surveillance for the disease (particularly at points of entry), and prepositioning of equipment and supplies. WHO will support these countries to integrate the plague preparedness and operational readiness activities into their overall multi- hazard preparedness and readiness functions. ### WHO risk assessment No new cases of confirmed bubonic plague have been notified after 8 November 2017 and no new cases of confirmed pneumonic have been notified since 14 November 2017. All contacts finished follow up on 19 November 2017. However, plague in Madagascar is seasonal and WHO expects additional reports of cases. It is therefore important for the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners to sustain prevention and response activities until April 2018. A longer term strategy will be needed for plague prevention, preparedness, and response. Based on the current epidemiology and response capacity, WHO estimates the risk of plague at the national level is moderate. The risk at the regional and global levels is low. ### WHO travel advice To date, there are no reported cases related to international travel. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar. WHO recommends that travel measures put in place by neighboring countries in relation to this outbreak be discontinued, given the containment of the pneumonic plague outbreak. International travellers arriving in Madagascar should be informed that plague is endemic in Madagascar, and about the recent plague outbreak. Travellers should protect themselves against flea bites, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood- tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Travellers should avoid self-medication, even if for prophylaxis. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms. If symptoms appear, travellers should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar. Following the visit of the Secretary General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) on 3 November, the UN body expressed confidence on tourism in Madagascar and echoed the WHO advice against any travel or trade restrictions against Madagascar1.

"(' From 1 January though 29 November 2017, a total of 3967 laboratory-confirmed and probable cases including 76 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.9%) were reported by the Ministry of Health to WHO. Of the cases reported, 596 were laboratory confirmed. Figure 1: Number of confirmed and probable cases in Kenya reported by week of illness onset from 1 January through 25 November 20171 1Date of illness onset is missing for 92 cases. From 1 January 2017 through 29 November, 20 of 47 counties (43%) in Kenya have reported cases. As of 29 November, seven counties continue to have active cholera outbreaks (Embu, Garissa, Kirinyaga, Mombasa, Nairobi, Turkana, and Wajir). The epidemiology of cholera for Kenya in 2017 is characterized by continuous transmission in affected communities coupled with outbreaks in camp settings and institutions or during mass gathering events. Continuous transmission in the community accounts for around 70% of the total cases with the majority of cases coming from the capital county, Nairobi. Transmission in camp settings occurred mainly within Garissa and Turkana counties, accounting for around 23% of the total reported cases. Both counties host big refugee camps, namely Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. Refugees in these camps come from countries currently experiencing complex emergencies and large cholera outbreaks. Seven percent of cases occurred in institutions and mass gathering events, where a number of people get infected from a point source. The country experiences cholera outbreaks every year; however, large cyclical epidemics occur approximately every five to seven years and last for two to three years. ### Public health response The country has activated the national task force to coordinate the outbreak response activities. Since January 2017, WHO and other partners have been providing technical support to the country to control of the outbreak. Following the development of the national response plan, WHO and other partners supported the country to scale-up the outbreak response activities such as surveillance, case management, and social mobilization. This was also coupled with the improvement of food hygiene standards and promotion of safe food handling, besides scaling-up Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) related activities. This resulted in a decline in the number of cholera cases. ### WHO risk assessment Despite the decline in the number of cases reported, the outbreak appears to be clustered around two major types of settings. First, the refugee camps particularly Kakuma and Dadaab, and second in the populous Nairobi capital county. Both settings are concerning, considering the overcrowded conditions and limited access to care in the first setting, and the high population density in the second setting. This could enable the spread of the outbreak to other districts. Also, previous outbreaks have shown that cases increase during the rainy season, which has started recently. In addition, various physical, social, political, and environmental factors increase the vulnerability and the susceptibility of the country’s population to the cholera outbreaks. These include regional drought, conflict, and insecurity in the Horn of Africa, and the increased movement within and to the country by people fleeing conflicts in Somalia and South Sudan. Overall, the risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels. ### WHO advice WHO recommends proper and timely case management in cholera treatment centres. The affected communities should have improved access to water, effective sanitation, proper waste management, and enhanced hygiene and food safety practices. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO encourages travellers to the affected area to take proper hygiene precautions to prevent potential exposure. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Kenya based on the information available on the current outbreak. For more information on cholera, please see the link below: ',)",3967
"(' On 6 October 2017, the Minister of Health declared an outbreak of cholera in the Zambian capital, Lusaka. From 28 September through 7 December 2017, 547 cases including 15 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.8%), have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak. The initial outbreak period was from 28 September through 20 October. From 21 October through 4 November 2017 there were less than five cases reported each week. However, from 5 November 2017 an increase in the number of cases was observed with a total of 136 cases reported in the week beginning 26 November. Figure 1: Number of cholera cases in Zambia reported by date of illness onset from 28 September to 2 December 2017 The cholera outbreak initially started in the Chipata sub-district and spread to Kanyama sub-district around 9 October 2017. The outbreak has spread from the peri-urban townships on the Western side of Lusaka City to the Eastern Side with a new case reported in Chelstone sub-district. As of 7 December, the affected sub-districts include Chipata, Kanyama, Chawama, Matero, Chilenje and Chelston. Sixty-two cases are currently receiving treatment in Cholera Treatment Centres in Chipata, Kanyama, Matero and Bauleni. One third of the cases are children under five years old and two thirds are persons five years and older. A total of 282 Rapid Diagnostic Tests were performed, of which 230 were positive. Of 310 culture tests, 53 were positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa (48 from Chipata, four from Kanyama and one from Bauleni). Water quality monitoring is ongoing in all sub-districts, with intensified activity in Kanyama, Matero and Chipata. The results so far show that nearly 42% of tested water sources are contaminated with either Faecal Coliforms or Escherichia coli. ### Public health response The following public health measures are currently being implemented: * The Ministry of Health is collaborating with WHO and other partners to control the outbreak. * Five Cholera Treatment Centres have been established in Chawama, Chipata, Kanyama, Matero and Bauleni sub-districts to manage cases. So far, 441 cases were successfully treated and discharged. * Cholera Outbreak Guidelines and standard operating procedures have been updated and shared with health workers. * The facilities in Lusaka District have continued with active surveillance, health education, chlorine distribution, contact tracing and environmental health monitoring. * The local authorities in collaboration with the Ministry of Health have embarked on closing contaminated water points and has implemented Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) interventions to improve water supplies in affected areas. This includes provision of household chlorine, disinfection of pit latrines, erection of water tanks, installation of water purifiers and intensification of water quality monitoring. * The Lusaka City Council has intensified collection of garbage and emptying of septic tanks in Kanyama and Chipata as priority areas. ### WHO risk assessment The current outbreak is occurring in Zambia’s largest city, Lusaka. The main affected sub-districts, Chipata and Kanyama, are densely populated and have an inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure, which may favour the spread of the disease. The sources of infection transmission in this outbreak have been associated with contaminated water supplies, contaminated food, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices. The coming of the rainy season, coupled with inadequate water supply and sanitation increases the risk of outbreaks in Lusaka and other parts of the country. Adequate supplies for cholera response should be obtained as part of preparedness activities. Zambia hosts about 60 000 refugees (as of September 2017) from neighbouring countries. A large proportion of refugees are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and are mostly residing in Nchelenge refugee camp located more than 1000 km distant from Lusaka. The influx of refugees has led to overcrowded settlements with high needs for shelter, healthcare and WASH facilities. Most refugees are in poor health condition, especially children; therefore, risk of disease outbreaks is high. Sanitation is a challenge at hosting sites. Given the security situation in DRC, further influx of refugees is expected. ### WHO advice WHO recommends proper and timely case management in Cholera Treatment Centres. Improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities, are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Use of oral cholera vaccine may also be used for outbreak control. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with Zambia based on the information available on the current outbreak. For more information on cholera, please see the link below: ',)",547
"(' From 15 August 2015 through 7 January 2018, 33 421 cases including 542 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.62%) have been reported across all 26 regions of the United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar). Tanzania mainland has reported 86% of the total cases in this outbreak. Children under five years old accounted for 11.4% of cases. Since the beginning of the outbreak over 7000 specimens have been tested for cholera and 47% were positive for Vibrio cholerae by culture. From 1 January 2017 through 31 December, 4985 cases including 99 deaths have been reported in Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar. The number of cases as well as geographical spread of cholera has markedly reduced compared to the two previous years. During the same period in 2016, 14 547 cases and 225 deaths were reported for Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar. In 2017, the highest number of cases was reported from Mbeya Region during week 31 (week starting 31 July 2017) and from Songwe Region during week 43 (week starting 23 October 2017). Between weeks 49-52, Uvinza, Songwe and Nyasa districts reported the highest number of cases. The resurgence of cases in Kigoma, Manyara, Dodoma, Mbeya and Dar es Salaam regions, and Ruvuma and Rukwa regions reporting cases for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak reflects the persisting risk for a cholera upsurge in many other regions. Zanzibar has reported no cases since the last case was reported on 11 July 2017, however high population movement to and from Tanzania Mainland still poses a risk of spread to Zanzibar. Figure 1: Number of cholera cases in Tanzania mainland reported by week of illness onset from 1 January through 7 January between 2015-2018. ### Public health response The following public health measures are currently being implemented: * The Ministry of Health (MoH) is collaborating with WHO and other partners (UNICEF and the United States Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) to implement and monitor cholera control activities through the National Task Force. * On 15 December 2017, the National Cholera Response Plan has been reviewed and validated by the MoH and stakeholders. * Cholera National Task Force meeting was conducted on Friday 29 December 2017 and agreed to deploy a team to assist Uvinza District to respond to the acute upsurge of cholera cases. * The MoH deployed a national rapid response team to Ruvuma Region which reported cases for the first time at the end of November 2017. * Community sensitization and awareness through local radio, television and social media is ongoing. * UNICEF is supporting the promotion and distribution of aqua tabs for household level water treatment and safe storage in the affected households. * Zanzibar is progressing to develop a ten year cholera elimination plan. * Initiation of exchanges for reinforcing the cross-border preparedness and response actions. ### WHO risk assessment Active cholera transmission has persisted in Tanzania Mainland, with Mbeya and Songwe Regions being the most active. The country remains vulnerable to the late detection of cholera due to the weak surveillance systems. The WASH activities, case management, community engagement, and surveillance pillars still require strengthening for optimal outbreak response and, if not addressed, further upsurge of cases may be observed throughout the country. The risk at national level is therefore high. The closure of the fishing camps along Lake Rukwa on the Songwe Region border, forced the fishermen to move further south to Kyela district which borders Malawi’s Karonga district. Malawi recently reported a cholera outbreak in Karonga. Cross-border population movement between the two countries might further increase the risk of transmission in Malawi. Other neighbouring countries such as DRC, Burundi, Zambia and Kenya are already experiencing large cholera outbreaks. The risk at regional level is high. ### WHO advice WHO recommends proper and timely case management in Cholera Treatment Centres. Improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities, are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar based on the information available on the current outbreak.

"(' During the week ending on 13 October 2017, the first identified case was admitted to a public hospital in Windhoek district, with signs and symptoms of hepatitis E. During the week ending on 8 January 2018, a total of 237 probable and confirmed cases have been seen at various health facilities in Windhoek district with the same signs and symptoms. All suspected patients tested negative for hepatitis A, B, and C. A total of 41 of the 237 cases were sent for further testing, and on 8 January 2018, the results showed 21 were IgM positive for hepatitis E. On 19 November 2017, there was one confirmed deceased case, a 26 year-old female, and four days prior to her death she had delivered a baby. The status of the baby is unknown. The majority of the cases were from Windhoek district, Khomas region. Figure 1: The number of patients seen with acute clinical jaundice in Windhoek district by week, from September 2017 to 8 January 2018 (n = 237) ### Public health response * On 14 December 2017, the national, regional, and district Health Emergency Management Committees were activated and the government of the city of Windhoek was informed of the outbreak. * Five different working groups have been formed to strengthen coordination and plan response activities under the following thematic areas; surveillance and laboratory, case management, coordination and logistics, WASH, environmental health, and social mobilization. * On 20 December 2017, the Minister of Health held a media briefing to educate the public about the outbreak with the participation of WHO and partners. * The Ministry of Health is currently leading the case management teams and all suspected cases have been referred to hospitals for treatment. To further strengthen surveillance and laboratory response activities, data collection and reporting tools have been distributed to health facilities. Case reporting and investigation, and line listing of cases have been enhanced. * An environmental health team from the Ministry of Health and Social Services and the City of Windhoek are currently conducting environmental investigations to identify exposures that led to the outbreak. * A national radio campaign to sensitize the affected communities to the risk of hepatitis E is ongoing as well as regular briefings of the public regarding the outbreak. The city of Windhoek has tested the water quality of the affected area and continues to monitor routinely. * The Ministry of Health has deployed a field epidemiologist to support the community engagement teams to ensure active case search and coordinated targeting of areas with active transmission. Beginning on 23 December 2017, orientations have been conducted to train Red Cross volunteers and community health workers to implement community sensitization and mobilization activities in areas at high risk of hepatitis E. * On 31 December 2017 a community engagement exercise was done to empower community leaders. The aim was to increase leaders’ awareness of disease prevention measures and also develop culturally acceptable interventions to change behavior and practices which were contributing to the spread of the disease in the community. * Community leaders and health extension workers were also oriented to educate the community on early care seeking for individuals having signs and symptoms compatible with hepatitis E. ### WHO risk assessment Although hepatitis A, B, and C are common in Namibia, hepatitis E is rarely diagnosed in the country. As a result, the country has limited capacity for hepatitis E laboratory diagnosis. Additionally, the majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported from informal settlements within the capital district, Windhoek, where living conditions are poor. These areas are overcrowded, and have limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. Moreover, the holiday season will likely increase the movement of people within the country. All of these could be major contributing factors to this outbreak. Additionally, during the rainy season, people often use rainwater or other surface water for drinking and domestic uses. This likely increases the risk of hepatitis E infection. Therefore, the above-mentioned factors might lead to the propagation of the cases from this area to other informal settlements and its distribution to other towns or districts, with similar poor environmental health conditions. Thus, the overall risk is assessed as high at the national level and low at regional and global levels. ### WHO advice WHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and proper sanitation through different methods, including at-home water purification techniques. The water quality should be regularly monitored in the affected areas. The number of latrines in different settlements should be increased to address the issue of open defecation. In addition, the waste management and the overall hygiene practices should be improved. Furthermore, the ongoing interventions should target at-risk population through the establishment of antenatal counseling for pregnant women, improving housing conditions for those living in these informal settlements and supporting the improvement of health facilities and patients care. The local and national reference laboratory capacities should be improved for timely confirmation of suspected cases. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Namibia on the basis of the information available on the current event. The implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease. ',)",237
"(' On 27 October 2017, the Ministry of Health in Mozambique notified WHO of an outbreak of cholera. From 14 August 2017 through 11 February 2018, 1799 cases and one death (case fatality rate = 0.06%) of cholera were reported from the two provinces; Nampula (1580 cases) and Cabo Delgado (219 cases). Underreporting of the number of cases and deaths is likely. This outbreak has been confirmed by Rapid Diagnostic Tests and culture. The outbreak started in Memba district in the north-eastern province Nampula and spread to Erati district by 15 October 2017. By 19 November, the outbreak had spread to two further districts in the same province (Nacaroa and Nampula city). Case incidence peaked in mid-November with 252 cases reported in one week; this peak was followed by a rapid decrease in reported cases (figure 1). A slow increase in the number of cases reported has been observed since late December 2017. On 5 January 2018, the first cases were reported from Pemba City in Cabo Delgado Province which is north of Nampula. In 2018 so far, the weekly number of cases have fluctuated between 30 and 60 cases. #### Figure 1: Number of cholera cases in Mozambique reported by the week of illness onset from 14 August 2017 through 11 February 2018 Cholera outbreaks have occurred in Mozambique every year for the past five years. The most recent outbreak prior to the current outbreak started in January 2017 and ended in April 2017, and resulted in a total of 2129 cases and four deaths (case fatality rate= 0.2%). Three provinces and six districts were affected in the 2017 outbreak (Tete, Nampula, and Maputo province). ### Public health response WHO and partners are supporting response activities to contain the outbreak. The following response measures are ongoing: * The Ministry of Health is leading a weekly coordination meeting at the national level to discuss the ongoing response. Partners including WHO, UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and the Red Cross attend and support the meeting. * Multi-sectoral coordination particularly at the district level; coordinating response actions between the different sectors and it is led by district officials. * WHO has conducted a rapid assessment of the situation in Nampula province and has shared the findings at the national coordination meeting. * WHO has supported training on case management and surveillance in Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces to improve case management, case detection, and reporting. * With support from UNICEF, national and local health authorities have provided logistical support to set up and supply cholera treatment centers with consumable, medication, and infection prevention and control supplies. Cholera treatment centers have been set up in each of the affected districts. * There are efforts to improve water quality, sanitation conditions, and hygiene practices in the affected districts are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities and water supply sector with the support of partners. * Social mobilization and risk communication activities are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities with the support of partners. ### WHO risk assessment Risk factors contributing to the propagation of cholera to other provinces and districts in this outbreak include a shortage of potable water and contamination of household drinking water, which emphasize the need to improve access to clean water, adequate hygiene, and sanitation. The three provinces which have reported cholera cases in this outbreak have been severely affected by the flooding which has resulted in the displacement of people and damage to the infrastructure, including health facilities. The meteorological forecast indicates that this heavy rainfall will continue for the next three months which may contribute to the potential spread of the outbreak. It is not possible to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, as no epidemiological or environmental investigations have been conducted in the two affected provinces and disease risk factors are unknown. Priorities at this stage are to strengthen the surveillance system, and harmonizing cholera data collection and line listing of the cases, as well as putting in place a mechanism for active case finding at the community level. In addition, the cholera case definition should be strictly applied to all suspected cases to decrease underreporting and to improve case detection in this outbreak. Other response activities such as case management, implementation of WASH interventions and social mobilization also need to be strengthened at the national, provincial, district and community levels. The overall risk is assessed as high at the national level; this assessment is partially due to the lack of information regarding the current outbreak dynamics and response actions. The risk is assessed to be low at the regional and global levels. ### WHO advice WHO recommends improving access to safe water, sanitation capacities, and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to case management should be improved in the affected areas. National capacity to rapidly detect and respond is needed if the outbreak spreads to other areas. The provision of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread of the outbreak should also be considered. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Mozambique based on the information available. The use of safe drinking water and the implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.

"(' On 14 February 2018, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of one case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N4) virus. This is the first human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) infection to be reported worldwide. The case-patient was a 68-year-old woman from Jiangsu Province with pre- existing coronary heart disease and hypertension and she developed symptoms on 25 December 2017. Seven days later, she was admitted to a local hospital for treatment of severe pneumonia and was discharged after 21 days. On 12 February, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) confirmed that the case-patient’s samples were positive for avian influenza A(H7N4). The NHFPC confirmed the diagnosis on 13 February 2018. The case- patient had reported a history of exposure to live poultry before onset of symptoms. Genetic sequencing of this A(H7N4) virus shows that all the virus segments originated from avian influenza viruses. This virus is sensitive to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors based on genetic sequencing. Twenty-eight close contacts of the case-patient have been under medical observation. Among close contacts, no abnormal findings have been found and all throat swabs from her contacts have tested negative. ### Public health response The Chinese government conducted a risk assessment, and has enhanced prevention and control measures, surveillance and epidemiological investigations including contact tracing and laboratory testing. Public risk communication and information sharing is ongoing. WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. WHO is facilitating information-sharing with Member States and is closely monitoring the situation, in line with the International Health Regulations (2005). ### WHO risk assessment This is the first report of a human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) infection globally and the case reported exposure to live backyard poultry before illness onset. Genetic analysis of this influenza A(H7N4) virus indicates that it is of avian origin. Close contacts of the case-patient tested negative for avian influenza A(H7N4) and remained asymptomatic. Current evidence suggests that this virus does not have the ability of sustained transmission to humans, thus the likelihood of sustained human to human transmission is low. Any animal influenza virus that develops the ability of human to human transmission can theoretically cause a pandemic. It is possible that additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N4) will be detected, however only one human case has been detected so far, and information on the circulation of avian influenza A(H7N4) in birds is not currently available. Further information needs to be gathered to increase the confidence in this assessment. ### WHO advice The public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry feces. Hand hygiene with frequent washing or use of alcohol hand sanitizer is recommended. WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied. ',)",1
"(' From mid-December 2017 through 3 February 2018, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Kenya reported 453 cases, including 32 laboratory-confirmed cases and 421 suspected cases, of chikungunya from Mombasa County. The outbreak was detected due to an increase in the number of patients presenting to health facilities in Mombasa County with high grade fever, joint pain and general body weakness. On 13 December 2017, eight blood samples from two private hospitals were collected and submitted to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) arbovirus laboratory in Nairobi. Of the eight samples tested, four were positive for chikungunya and four were positive for dengue by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. On 4 January 2018, blood samples were collected from 32 additional suspected cases and sent to the KEMRI laboratory. Of these, 27 samples tested positive and five samples tested negative for chikungunya by PCR. A large proportion, approximately 70%, of cases reported severe joint pain and high grade fever. The scale of this outbreak has likely been underestimated given the under-reporting of cases and low levels of health-seeking behaviors among the affected population. The large mosquito breeding sites in affected areas and inadequate vector control mechanisms also represent major propagating factors. Based on reports from peripheral health facilities, the outbreak has spread to the six sub-counties (Changamwe, Jomvu, Kisauni, Likoni, Mvita and Nyali) of Mombasa and one in Kilifi: with the majority of suspected cases reported from Mvita and Likoni in Mombasa. ### Public health response The following public health measures are ongoing: * WHO is supporting the MoH in drafting a chikungunya response plan for Mombasa County; * WHO is supporting the National Emergency Operations Centre with analyzing data and developing situation reports; * Vector control activities, including eliminating mosquito breeding sites, fogging and indoor residual spraying; * Chikungunya outbreak alert and fact sheet were issued to all health facilities, including private hospitals, in the affected areas; * Information, education and communication materials were developed and distributed to households by the community health volunteers. ### WHO risk assessment Based on the available information, the risk of continued transmission in affected areas and spread to unaffected areas cannot be ruled out. Mombasa is the second largest city in Kenya with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants. The city has a rapidly growing population, and some areas experience overcrowding, numerous open dump sites, inadequate drainage, stagnant water and ample breeding sites for mosquitoes. These factors make Mombasa particularly vulnerable to vector-borne diseases. Mombasa County is also a popular tourist destination and a sub-regional transportation hub with connections to Rwanda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. This is the first time that active circulation of chikungunya has been laboratory confirmed in Mombasa. Further sequencing of the circulating virus is therefore needed to better assess the current epidemiologic situation. ### WHO advice #### Personal protection Basic precautions should be taken by people living in and travelling to Mombasa County. These precautions include the use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting mosquitoes is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535 (3-[N-acetyl-N-butyl]-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester) or icaridin (1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester). The use of air conditioning, window screens, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers as well as sleeping under a mosquito bed net even during the day are recommended to prevent biting by mosquitos indoors. #### Vector control Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of the natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that act as mosquito breeding sites. This requires mobilizing the affected communities, strengthening entomological monitoring to assess impact of control measures and implementing additional controls as needed to avoid misconceptions and false rumors. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Kenya based on the information currently available. For more information, please see the link below: ',)",453
"(' From 25 November 2017 through 23 February 2018, 1065 cases including 43 deaths (case fatality rate = 4%) have been reported from 32 out of 35 health zones in Kinshasa province. From 25 November 2017 through 15 February 2018, 177 stool specimens were collected for testing at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). Out of the total stool specimens, 83 tested positive for Vibrio cholerae, 83 tested negative, and 11 are currently being analysed. Since the end of November 2017, Kinshasa province has been facing an outbreak of cholera. In January 2018, following intensive rains and flooding events, case numbers increased from less than five to more than 100 weekly reported cases. However since mid-January, there has been a downward trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cholera cases (Figure 1). #### Figure 1. Number of confirmed and suspected cholera cases in Kinshasa reported by week of admission from 25 November 2017 through 23 February 2018 The Democratic Republic of the Congo is an endemic country for cholera. Sporadic cases and outbreaks are common, particularly in the eastern provinces of the country. Kinshasa, is not part of the endemic provinces for cholera, but has reported several cholera outbreaks over the last years. ### Public health response * Case management continues at five of the cholera treatment centers (CTC) and cholera treatment units (CTU), Pakadjuma, Luka, Bumbu, Liziba CTUs and Maluka I CTC. * Pakadjuma, Luka and Bumba CTUs are managed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Belgium. * Liziba CTU is managed by MSF Spain. * Maluku CTC is managed by the Maluku I Health Zone with support from WHO. * MSF Belgium has planned for the withdrawal of Pakadjuma CTU which is scheduled for 28 February 2018, following a significant decrease in the number of cases. A transferral mechanism will be put in place for the transfer of any case to the Liziba CTU. The national laboratory INRB is providing laboratory confirmation services by testing stool culture. * WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to improve surveillance and case reporting at the community level and has procured and shipped diarrhoeal and emergency kits. * The National Red Cross Society is supporting hygiene promotion activities. * In 2016, the Ministry of Health supported by WHO and partners conducted an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign in Kinshasa, targeting around 375 000 individuals across five health zones (Limete, Maluku I, Masina II, Nsele and Kingabwa). The campaign was successful with an administrative coverage of 94.6% for the first round and 94.0% for the second round. ### WHO risk assessment Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria present in faecally contaminated water or food. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context. Kinshasa is the third largest city in Africa with a population of approximately 10 million inhabitants. The city is characterized by a rapidly growing population driven by rural migration, leading to overcrowding and frequent occupation of flood plains that are not suitable for settlement, poor infrastructure, lack of adequate drainage and limited access to water and sanitation. These factors make Kinshasa particularly vulnerable to flooding and waterborne diseases, especially during the rainy season, which runs from November to June. Although the weekly incidence of cases in Kinshasa has been on a downward trend since mid-January 2018, the situation remains alarming. New cases have been reported in areas located along the Congo River which is a major trading and transport axis to and from Kinshasa. During week beginning 13 February 2018, the health zone of Maluku I in Kinshasa province reported cases for the first time since the beginning of this outbreak. Maluku I is a major port city and an endemic area for cholera in Kinshasa. However since a vaccination campaign was conducted in this area in October 2016, no cases had been reported until now. The emergence of cases in areas along the Congo River and the arrival of the second rainy season which will last from March to June pose a risk for the resurgence of cases in Kinshasa. This outbreak has started in 2015 and is considered as the worst cholera epidemic experienced by the country since 1994. In 2017, a total of 55 000 cases and 1190 deaths have been reported nationally. This is almost double the number of cases reported in 2016. Overall 24 out of 26 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have reported cases. The country is going through a long lasting economic and political crisis. Furthermore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also responding to a large humanitarian emergency (IASC level 3) with more than 4 000 000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 600 000 refugees. The country’s resources and capacity to effectively respond to the current outbreak are limited. The risk of this outbreak spreading to neighbouring countries is considered high due to regular population movement and the risk at the global level was assessed to be low. ### WHO advice WHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and sanitation and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to appropriate case management should be improved in the areas affected by the outbreak to decrease mortality. Ensuring national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to the cholera outbreak will be needed to decrease the risk of spread to new areas. The use of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread should also be considered. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the information available on the current outbreak. The use of microbiologically safe drinking water and implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.

"(' Circulation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Somalia. Three cVDPV2s strains were isolated from environmental samples collected on 4 and 11 January 2018, in Banadir province (Mogadishu). These latest isolates are genetically linked to cVDPV2 strains collected from environmental samples in the same province on 22 October and 2 November 2017. No associated cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been detected. ### Public health response Since detection of the initial isolates in 2017, two large-scale immunization campaigns (SIA) in line with internationally-agreed guidelines have been implemented, in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle provinces. A third SIA is planned for March 2018, and further response based on evolving epidemiology and ongoing risk assessment is being evaluated. Surveillance for AFP is being strengthened. WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2. ### WHO risk assessment The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. Such event also underscores the risk in areas or regions with continued substantial insecurity that hampers maintaining high population immunity through routine vaccination. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and prevention measures being implemented. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement prevention measures, and speed-up the response if needed. Countries should also maintain uniformly on all their territory high polio immunization coverage through routine vaccination to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction or emergence. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel. Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to International Health Regulations Temporary Recommendations that request them to report a case of polio as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travelers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travelers before departure. ',)",0
"(' The ongoing cholera outbreak in Somalia started in December 2017. As of 18 March 2018, a total of 1613 cholera cases, including nine deaths (case fatality rate = 0.6%), have been reported from four regions: Hiraan, Banadir, Lower Juba and Middle Shabelle. The outbreak started in Beletweyne, Hiraan Region; it spread to Banadir Region in early January 2018, to Lower Juba in early February 2018, and to Middle Shabelle in early February 2018. Of the 66 stool samples tested in 2018, 19 were positive for Vibrio cholerae serogroup 01 serotype Ogawa. Banadir Region is one of the regions with the highest concentration of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Lower Juba has experienced cholera outbreaks in the past; on the border with Kenya and the region has many people who have been displaced by conflict in Middle Juba. Middle Shabelle has also previously had cholera outbreaks. Access to safe water and sanitation is limited in all of the affected regions. #### Figure 1. Number of confirmed and suspected cholera cases in Somalia reported from February 2017 through February 2018 Source: Situation Report for Cholera, Ministry of Health, Somali Federal Republic ### Public health response The Ministry of Health (MoH), with support from WHO and partners, has implemented the following ongoing response measures: * Established weekly meetings between the MoH and Health Cluster partners. * Strengthened surveillance and case investigations, where security permits. * Trained and deployed community health volunteers to provide basic patient care in affected communities. * Conducted training for national, state and regional level integrated rapid response teams. * Dispatched cholera and diarrhoeal disease kits to local response partners and hospitals. * Trained evaluators for systematic monitoring of cholera treatment centres to assess capacity and quality of care and recommend reinforcement where necessary. * Developed and implemented cholera case management sessions with the support of the Global Cholera Task Force partners. * Distributed hygiene kits to inaccessible areas through community health volunteers and different non-governmental organizations. * Carried out social mobilization and community education activities by State and Regional Government authorities. * Prepared and disseminated Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials on acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera prevention. * Implemented oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaigns. From 11 through 18 February 2018, an OCV campaign was conducted in Hudur district and Afmadow district. The second OCV has taken place from 11 through 18 March 2018. ### WHO risk assessment Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context. Cholera is endemic in Somalia and continuous transmission was reported in the last few years. The last outbreak, which occurred in 2017, was one of the largest cholera epidemics the country has experienced: 78 000 cases, including 1159 deaths (case fatality ratio = 1.5%) were reported from 16 regions. The outbreak reached its peak in April 2017 and gradually declined from June until August 2017, and only few sporadic suspected cases were recorded between October and November 2017. Despite the control and prevention measures implemented during the last large cholera outbreak in 2017, the risk of the current outbreak is considered high at the national level because of the following: * Only 16% of the at-risk population was vaccinated during last year’s OCV campaign, which is too low to provide population-level immunity; * There are large population movements in the affected areas due to drought, conflict and floods; * The regions affected have the highest concentration of IDPs where access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) is limited; * Funding for cholera control and treatment measures will continue through to 2018, which include activities related to WASH and OCV campaigns. The lack of longer-term funding, however, remains a concern as the seasonal recurrence patterns require more predictable financing for more effective prevention and mitigation. At the regional and global levels, the level of risk was assessed by WHO to be low. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO recommends improving access to safe water and sanitation to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcing surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to appropriate case management should be improved in the affected areas to decrease mortality. The use of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread should also be considered. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Somalia based on the information available.

"(' On 2 March 2018, the Australian National Focal Point (NFP) notified WHO of an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infection (listeriosis) associated with the consumption of rockmelons (cantaloupe) from a single grower. From 17 January 2018 through to 6 April 2018, 20 outbreak cases (19 confirmed and 1 probable) of listeriosis were reported. All of the cases were hospitalized and there have been seven deaths and one miscarriage associated with the outbreak. All of the outbreak cases have had illness onset since 17 January 2018. ### Public health response Epidemiological investigations suggested that the source of the outbreak was rockmelon (cantaloupe melons) from a single grower in Australia. Epidemiological and environmental investigations were undertaken, which led to the recall of rockmelons produced by the single grower on 27 February 2018. On 1 March 2018, the Australian NFP was notified that international distribution of the affected product had occurred. Australian authorities received information from trace forward investigations on 2 March 2018 that the rockmelons from this grower were exported to eight countries; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (China), Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Singapore, and United Arab Emirates. The Australian NFP directly advised these countries on 3 March 2018 about the export of rockmelons from Australia to their country. In parallel, a notification via the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) was also sent on 3 March 2018. Further trace forward investigations on 7 March 2018 identified that Bahrain also received an export of the rockmelons from this grower and on 8 March 2018, investigations further identified that the affected rockmelons may have been included in a consignment to the Seychelles. The Australian NFP advised the Bahrain NFP directly on 8 March 2018 and the Seychelles NFP directly on 9 March 2018. As of 8 March, trace forward activities have been concluded. The INFOSAN emergency contact points in the importing countries were provided with specific distribution details of the rockmelons to their respective countries by the INFOSAN emergency contact point in Australia, as they became available. On 4 April 2018, it was reported that more than 30 samples of melons from the grower through the supply chain, including retail and on farm, tested positive to Listeria monocytogenes. Additional testing found L. monocytogenes in the packing area. All L. monocytogenes samples had the same genetic sequence as the human cases. It is believed that the cause of the outbreak was a combination of environmental conditions and weather contaminating the surface of the fruit, with low levels of the bacteria persisting after the washing process. The grower continues to work closely with the relevant authorities and has returned to supply rockmelons (during the week starting 2 April) after testing cleared the property. ### WHO risk assessment The prompt epidemiological and environmental investigation carried out led to the identification of the outbreak source and enabled the issuing of a recall. Due to the potentially long incubation period of L. monocytogenes, further outbreak cases may be reported. Import details have been provided though INFOSAN to the affected countries to enable them to take appropriate management measures including local recalls and risk communication. Cases in the affected countries may still be identified. ### WHO advice Pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals should take precautions to avoid infection by Listeria by avoiding the consumption of high risk foods including dairy products made of unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, deli meat products (ready-to eat meat cuts, pâté, etc.); ice creams, raw seafood, crustaceans, and shellfish. These are the most common foods associated with Listeria infection. In recent years, melon, and other fruits and vegetables have been implicated on rare occasions in outbreaks of listeriosis. To reduce the risk, it is important to thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables. It is recommended that risk communication messages regarding listeriosis be targeted to at-risk groups, primarily pregnant women, older persons and people with weakened immune systems, for example people with cancer, HIV, diabetes, kidney or liver disease or those taking immunosuppressive medications. These messages should recommend avoiding the consumption of high-risk foods. ',)",20
"(' On 8 May 2018, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of two confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease occurring in Bikoro health zone, Equateur province. From 4 April through 9 May 2018, a total of 32 Ebola virus disease cases (among which two are confirmed, 18 probable and 12 suspected cases) were reported from Bikoro health zone, Equateur province, including 18 deaths. Three of the 32 cases were among healthcare workers. The patients presented with fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, myalgia and arthralgia, and some also showed haemorrhagic signs and symptoms. All cases were reported from the catchment area of the Ikoko-Impenge health facility, located 30 km from the central health zone office of Bikoro, which is 280 km by road from Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur province. Of the 21 initially reported cases on 8 May 2018, 17 had epidemiological links (potential contacts with another suspect case). Five samples were collected from hospitalized patients, three from Ikoko- Impenge and two from Bikoro. These were sent to Institute National de Recherche Biomédicale in Kinshasa on 7 May 2018, where the two samples from Ikoko-Impenge were found positive by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for Ebola virus on the same day. Over the last four decades, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced eight Ebola outbreaks. The most recent epidemic took place in May 2017 in the health zone of Likati, province of Bas-Uele. The ongoing epidemic is located in the Bikoro health zone, located in Equateur province, in western Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the border with the Republic of Congo. This is the fourth time that an Ebola outbreak has been reported in the former province of Equateur, following those of 1976, 1977 and 2014. However, this is the first time that the Bikoro health zone is facing an Ebola outbreak. The province of Equateur has an estimated population of 2.5 million people with 284 registered health facilities. Bikoro health zone has a population of around 163 000 people with three hospitals and 19 health centres covering the population, most with limited functionality. Medical supplies are provided by international bodies, but stock outs are frequent. ### Public health response * The Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo deployed Rapid Response Teams to investigate cases and deaths reported in Bikoro health zone in the Equateur province. * One million US dollars from the WHO contingency fund for emergencies have been mobilized. * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and Partners in the activation of multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response at all levels. * Médecins Sans Frontières is setting up a treatment centre for the management of cases in Bikoro health zone. * WHO has shared risk communication materials in French and Lingala with the WHO country offices. * Active surveillance activities among the community, the Ikoko-Impenge health centre team and Bikoro General Reference Hospital are being undertaken. * Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established. * Wellcome Trust is providing two million pounds sterling for the critical research needed to support the operational response which is now underway in the country. ### WHO risk assessment To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote area and appears to be geographically limited. However, in view of the available data, the overall risk is considered high at the national level due to the nature of the disease and the lack of epidemiological and demographic information to estimate the magnitude of the epidemic. The overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the proximity to the Congo river, which links with both the capitals of the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Information is currently limited and investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak. Based on the information currently available and the rapid response measures implemented by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and partners, the event does not meet the criteria of a public heath emergency of international concern as defined in the IHR (2005)1, and does not warrant the convening of an Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005). ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information.

Medical supplies are provided by international bodies, but stock outs are frequent. ### Public health response * The Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo deployed Rapid Response Teams to investigate cases and deaths reported in Bikoro health zone in the Equateur province. * One million US dollars from the WHO contingency fund for emergencies have been mobilized. * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and Partners in the activation of multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response at all levels. * Médecins Sans Frontières is setting up a treatment centre for the management of cases in Bikoro health zone. * WHO has shared risk communication materials in French and Lingala with the WHO country offices. * Active surveillance activities among the community, the Ikoko-Impenge health centre team and Bikoro General Reference Hospital are being undertaken. * Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established. * Wellcome Trust is providing two million pounds sterling for the critical research needed to support the operational response which is now underway in the country. ### WHO risk assessment To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote area and appears to be geographically limited. However, in view of the available data, the overall risk is considered high at the national level due to the nature of the disease and the lack of epidemiological and demographic information to estimate the magnitude of the epidemic. The overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the proximity to the Congo river, which links with both the capitals of the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Information is currently limited and investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak. Based on the information currently available and the rapid response measures implemented by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and partners, the event does not meet the criteria of a public heath emergency of international concern as defined in the IHR (2005)1, and does not warrant the convening of an Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005). ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions of the international traffic in place.

"(' In response to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO is working with the Ministry of Health, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), UNICEF and other partners including the Ministry of Health of Guinea, to conduct vaccination against Ebola for people at high risk of infection in affected health zones. On 21 May 2018, ring vaccination started along with vaccination of health workers in Mbandaka (WHO) and Bikoro (MSF). As of 21 May, Merck has provided WHO with 8640 doses of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV vaccine of which 7540 doses are available in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (approximately enough for 50 rings of 150 people). An additional 8000 doses will be available in the coming days. In 2017, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended, that for outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus, the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV vaccine should be used under the Expanded Access framework, with informed consent and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV vaccine is highly protective against Zaire ebolavirus and is the first with demonstrated efficacy. Several study trials that included more than 16 000 volunteers in Europe, Africa and America show that the vaccine has a good safety profile among persons six years of age and above. In Guinea and Sierra Leone, the vaccine was used in an efficacy trial of 7500 adults in 2015 and found safe and protective against Zaire ebolavirus infection. The evidence from all 117 rings in Guinea and Sierra Leone showed that no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after vaccination among all immediately vaccinated contacts and contacts of contacts versus 23 cases among eligible contacts and contacts of contacts who were not vaccinated or for whom vaccination was delayed. The estimated vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI 79·3–100·0, p=0·0033). This trial was conducted by WHO, with the Guinean Ministry of Health, MSF, and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. In March 2016, following a newly identify chain of Ebola virus transmission in Guinee Forestiere, 1510 individuals were vaccinated in four rings, including 303 individuals aged between 6–17 years and 307 front-line workers. It took 10 days to vaccinate the first participant following the confirmation of the first case of Ebola virus disease. No secondary cases of Ebola virus disease occurred among persons who received the vaccine. Given the remote location and limited road access to the populations affected in the current outbreak, implementing ring vaccination and maintaining the required -80⁰C cold chain presents major logistical challenges for the Ministry of Health, MSF, WHO and other partners on the ground. Vaccination will be implemented using a ring approach, similar to that used in Guinea in 2015, whereby the vaccine will be offered to people at risk, including but not limited to: (i) contacts and contacts of contacts; (ii) local and international health-care and front-line workers in the affected areas and (iii) health-care and front-line workers in areas at risk of expansion of the outbreak. With their agreement and consent, the individuals in the ring will be considered for the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, individuals will be followed up for a period of time. Each vaccination team is trained and knowledgeable of Good Clinical Practices. The team includes Guinean researchers that conducted the Ring Trial in Guinea and Sierra Leone and the intervention under Compassionate use/Expanded Access in Guinea. Any adverse effects will be treated by qualified physicians and all serious adverse effects will be reported to authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Merck and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). They are supported by experienced logisticians. The steps for the ring vaccination are clearly defined and include: * 1–2 social mobilizers in the vaccination team will visit the community and explain the process to people potentially eligible for the vaccine. * The definition of the ring is made by two members of the vaccination team who are trained and will list all the contacts and contacts of contacts of a patient confirmed with Ebola virus (including absent residents). * Eligibility of participants is assessed. * Informed consent of each individual eligible person is sought. * Vaccination of eligible persons who have given their consent. * Persons vaccinated will be monitored by a doctor for 30 minutes following vaccination and then followed up by home visits on days 3 and 14 after vaccination. The use of the investigational rVSVΔG-ZEBOV vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo marks a milestone for the control of Ebola virus outbreaks. Nonetheless, the vaccine is just one of several outbreak control measures, including case finding, contact tracing, isolation of suspected cases, prompt laboratory diagnosis, infection control in routine healthcare facilities, safe and dignified burials, community mobilization, and effective response coordination.

"(' Since the last Disease Outbreak News on 23 May 2018, six additional cases have been laboratory confirmed for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Recently available information has enabled the classification of some cases to be updated1 . From 4 April through 27 May 2018, a cumulative total of 54 Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases including 25 deaths (overall case fatality ratio = 46%) have been reported from three health zones in Equateur Province. The total includes 35 confirmed, 13 probable and six suspected cases from the three health zones, Bikoro (n=22; 10 confirmed, 11 probable and 1 suspected cases), Iboko (n=27; 21 confirmed, two probable and four suspected cases) and Wangata (n=5; four confirmed, and one suspected cases) (Figure 3). Of the four cases reported in Wangata, two have an epidemiological link with a probable case in Bikoro from April 2018. The suspected Ebola virus disease case reported in Ntondo health zone on 25 May has tested negative and has been ruled out. Five health care workers were among the 54 cases reported. As of 28 May, 74% of the 992 registered contacts have been traced. Figure 1 shows the date of illness onset for 46 confirmed and probable cases from 5 May through 25 May 2018. The age range of all cases is from 8 to 80 years old and the median age is 41 years old. 60% of the cases are male (Figure 2). Figure 2 shows the age and sex distribution for 47 confirmed and probable cases. Figure 3 shows the location of confirmed, probable, and suspected cases by health zone. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by date of illness onset from 4 April through 25 May 2018 (n=46) Date of illness onset is unknown for two cases. #### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by age and sex from 4 April through 25 May 2018 (n=47) Age is unknown for one case. #### Figure 3: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ebola cases per Health Zone in Equateur province from 4 April through 27 May 20182 ### Public health response The Ministry of Health is leading the response in affected health zones with the support of WHO and partners. Priorities include the strengthening of surveillance and contract tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, case management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, and vaccination. * Since the launch of the vaccination intervention on 21 May, a total of 462 people have been vaccinated. Populations eligible for ring vaccination are front-line health professionals, people who have been exposed to confirmed Ebola virus disease cases and contacts of these contacts. * WHO continues to strengthen surveillance and contract tracing activities. On 23 May 2018, a total of 40 staff in health facilities were trained in Mbandaka on the use of the field data collection tool (Early Warning, Alert and Response (EWAR) System) for the early notification of alerts and suspected Ebola virus disease cases and the follow up of contacts. * Case management and infection, prevention and control activities continue to be scaled up with the establishment, stocking and staffing of Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) within affected areas. WHO is coordinating the deployment of multiple medical teams to support the Ebola treatment centres (ETCs), case referral system, and to support health facilities to remain open for non-Ebola care. The care of suspected and confirmed Ebola virus disease patients is currently being provided by Médecins Sans Frontières in Bikoro, Wangata where ETCs have been set up. * WHO, UNICEF and partners are supporting the Ministry of Health to raise awareness and engage affected communities to promote the early identification of signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease, seek prompt treatment, and practice safe and dignified burials. Communication of key messages in churches, schools, market places and door-to-door house visits is the main approach used to raise awareness on Ebola virus disease in Mbandaka, Wangata, Bikoro and Itipo. * As of 29 May, WHO has deployed 156 technical experts to support response efforts in the three hotspots of Bikoro, Iboko, and Wangata (Mbandaka city). WHO is working with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners and technical networks, including the Emerging Diseases Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN) and the WHO Emerging and Dangerous Pathogen Laboratory Network (EDPLN) to coordinate response planning and to deploy additional technical support. As of 28 May, 15 experts from GOARN partner institutions are deployed through WHO to support response activities in the field. * WHO together with partners (International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) are assessing key strategic points of entry/exit in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, and Kinshasa, including international airports and major ports. Exit screening measures are in place and will be further strengthened with the aim to prevent the international spread of the disease. * WHO is enhancing preparedness and readiness activities in nine neighbouring countries: Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. The activities undertaken include the deployment of Preparation Support Teams (PST) to eight out of nine countries to assess Ebola virus disease readiness using a standardized tool and support development of contingency plans, with partners. ### WHO risk assessment The confirmed case in Mbandaka, a large urban centre located on major national and international rivers, roads and domestic air routes, increases the risk of spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. WHO has, therefore, assessed the public health risk to very high at the national level and high at the regional level. Nine neighbouring countries, including Congo-Brazzaville and Central African Republic, have been advised that they are at high risk of spread, and preparedness activities are being undertaken. At the global level the risk currently remains low. This risk assessment is continuously being review as further information becomes available. Based on the current situation and information available, the WHO Director- General convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) on 18 May to provide advice on whether the current outbreak constitutes a public heath event of international concern3 . It was the view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern have not currently been met. ### WHO advice In light of the advice of the Emergency Committee, convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, WHO continues to advise against the application of any travel or trade restrictions. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions on international traffic in place. The Emergency Committee while noting that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) are not currently met, issued comprehensive Public Health Advice. WHO has issued travel advice for international travellers in relation to the current Ebola outbreak. * * * 1The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results.

"(' ### Event summary On 19 May 2018, three deaths due to Nipah virus infection were reported in Kozhikode District, Kerala State, India. The three deaths occurred in a family cluster and a fourth death was subsequently reported in a health care worker who was involved in treatment of the family in the local hospital. Laboratory testing of throat swabs, urine and blood samples collected from four suspected patients has been conducted by the National Institute of Virology in Pune; three of the four reported deaths were confirmed positive for Nipah virus (NiV) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM Elisa for NiV. The field investigation team found bats living in the abandoned water well on the premises of a new house where the family had plans to move after renovation. One bat was caught and sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune for laboratory testing. As of 28 May 2018 and since the beginning of the outbreak, as a result of further investigations and contact tracing, 15 people have tested positive for NiV in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, Kerala State. Of the 15 laboratory- confirmed cases, two are hospitalized and thirteen have died, including the health care worker who was involved in treatment of the deceased. As of 28 May, 13 deaths have been reported: three from Malappuram District and ten from Kozhikode District. One deceased case, the index case, could not be tested but was epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case. There are 16 suspected cases identified through contact tracing who are under observation while their laboratory results are pending and at least 753 additional people, including health care workers, under observation. Laboratory testing is being conducted by the Manipal Institute of Virus Research and the National Institute of Virology, Pune; both laboratories have advanced capacity for RT-PCR. In the current outbreak, acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis have been observed. This is the first NiV outbreak reported in Kerala State and third NiV outbreak known to have occurred in India, with the most recent outbreak reported in 2007. ### Public health response ### Government response * A multi-disciplinary central team from the National Centre for Disease Control was sent to Kerala to investigate and respond. Contact tracing has been initiated. Infection prevention and control measures have been strengthened in health facilities. * Acute fever and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) surveillance have been enhanced across the state. Hospital and community surveillance have also been strengthened in Kerala. * The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Manipal Hospital and the National Institute of Virology are conducting laboratory testing to confirm cases. * The government is coordinating with all relevant sectors including zoonosis, wildlife, animal husbandry, human health, clinicians, pulmonologists, neurologists and private sector. * Risk communication messages are being delivered to the community, public, stakeholders, and partners. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has shared guidelines drafted by the National Centre for Disease Control with states and relevant stakeholders and also posted them on the MoHFW website. ### WHO response * WHO is in contact with national authorities and continues to closely monitor this event. * At the request of the MoHFW, WHO has shared materials, especially risk communication materials on Nipah virus, including those used in Bangladesh. * The MoHFW is conducting preliminary investigations and may request that WHO support the response. * The MoHFW is coordinating a multi-dimensional investigation and may request support from WHO. ### WHO Risk Assessment NiV infection is an emerging zoonotic disease of public health importance in the WHO South-East Asia Region with a high case fatality rate estimated to be between 40 and 75%; however, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. NiV was first recognized in 1998-1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. No subsequent outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia or Singapore since 1999. NiV was first recognized in India and Bangladesh in 2001; since then, nearly annual outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh. The disease has been identified periodically in eastern India (2001, 2007). Limited human-to-human transmission of NiV can occur among family members and health workers who treat infected patients. Large fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are the natural reservoirs of NiV and given the wide distribution of the species and migration of the locally-abundant fruit bats in India, the risk of exposure to NiV is high. Nevertheless, previous outbreaks in affected countries have had a strong seasonal pattern and a limited geographical range. Possible routes of transmission for this outbreak include consumption of fruits partially eaten by the bats, exposure to the virus by bats or human-to- human transmission through unprotected close contact in the community or hospital. Many cases identified in the current outbreak were infected through direct unprotected contact with other infected persons. Given that India has faced and contained Nipah virus outbreaks before, the country has the capacity to rapidly respond and verify cases with laboratory testing. At the moment, the outbreak is localized and WHO assesses the risk to be low at the national and regional levels. ### WHO Advice Currently, there are no specific treatments available for Nipah virus disease and care is supportive. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications. NiV infection can be prevented by avoiding exposure to sick pigs and bats in endemic areas, and by avoiding consuming fruits partially-eaten by infected bats or drinking raw date palm sap/toddy/juice. In health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for a patient suspected to have NiV fever should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing. Research is needed to better understand the ecology of bats and NiV. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on India based on the information currently available on this event. ',)",16
"(' In response to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO in collaboration with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and other partners, has developed a comprehensive strategic response plan for points of entry. The aim of the plan is to avoid the spread of the disease to other provinces or at the international level. The plan includes mapping strategic points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and therefore are at risk of Ebola virus disease transmission based on population movement. The plan also includes implementing health measures at the identified points of entry/traveller congregation points, such as risk communication and community engagement, temperature checks, provision of hand hygiene and sanitation materials, and the development of alert, investigation and referral procedures. As of 18 May 2018, a total of 115 points of entry/traveller congregation points have been listed and mapped along cordon sanitaires in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, larger Equateur Province, and Kinshasa. Of these, some 30 points of entry have been prioritized for in-depth assessments and for implementing relevant prevention, detection and control measures. These include major ports and congregation points along the Congo river, as well as the two airports and the international port in Kinshasa. Areas of large gatherings such as markets are also being assessed. Along the Congo river there are many private smaller ports and points of congregation with a low volume of traffic. Proper screening cannot be conducted at all 115 points, and the efforts currently focus on the 30 prioritized points of entries/ traveller congregation points, as well as on risk communications activities and community engagement. Entry and exit screening measures have been implemented at the Mbandaka airport, as well as in some terminals of the Kinshasa international airport. These include travel health declaration, visual observation for symptoms, temperature check and travel health promotion measures, as well as procedures for referral of suspect cases. The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, was convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, and advised against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in relation to the current Ebola outbreak, as flight cancellations and other travel restrictions may hinder the international public health response and may cause significant economic damage to the affected country (see link below). The Emergency Committee also advised that exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance; however entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value. WHO is monitoring travel and trade measures in relation to the current outbreak. As of 28 May, 23 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but there are currently no restrictions of international traffic in place. ### WHO advice The Emergency Committee convened by the Director-General on 18 May 2018 noted that the Ebola outbreak does not currently meet the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee issued comprehensive Public Health Advice , in particular with regards to the fact that there should be no international travel or trade restrictions, that neighbouring countries should strengthen preparedness and surveillance, and that during the response, safety and security of staff should be ensured, and protection of responders of national and international staff should prioritised. WHO has also issued travel advice for international travellers in relation to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see link below). #### Travellers going through the exit screening from the Democratic Republic of the Congo Effective exit screening helps prevent the exportation and spread of disease to other areas. During exit screening at international airports and points of entry, travellers will be assessed for signs and symptoms of an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease, or identified as contacts potentially exposed to Ebola virus disease. * Travellers with a possible exposure to Ebola virus and who are sick should postpone international travel and seek immediate medical assistance if there is a possible exposure to Ebola virus disease; * Any person with an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation (see link below); * Travellers should plan to arrive early at the travel facility and expect delays related to public health screening; * Travellers will be required to complete a Traveller Public Health Declaration, and these will be reviewed prior to clearance to board; * Temperature measurement will be required, in addition to normal security provisions; * Boarding may be denied based on public health criteria. #### Travellers with symptoms on board a conveyance There is a possibility that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus and developed symptoms may board a commercial flight or other mode of transport, without informing the transport company of his/her status. Such travellers should seek immediate medical attention upon arrival, mention their recent travel history, and then be isolated to prevent further transmission. Information of close contacts of this person on board the aircraft (e.g. passengers one seat away from the ill traveller on the same flight, including across an aisle, and crew who report direct body contact with the ill traveller) should be obtained through collaboration with various stakeholders at points of entry (e.g. airline reservation system) in order to undergo contact tracing. #### Returning travellers The risk of a traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. Transmission requires direct contact with blood or fluids of infected persons or animals (alive or dead), all unlikely exposures for the average traveller (see link below). There is, however, a risk for health care workers and volunteers, especially if involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients. The risk can be considered low, unless adequate infection prevention and control measures (such as use of clean water and soap or alcohol-based hand rubs, personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and proper waste management) are not followed, including at points of medical care at ports, airports and ground crossings. As the incubation period for Ebola is between 2 to 21 days, travellers involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients or who suspect possible exposure to Ebola virus in the affected areas, should take the following precautions for 21 days after returning: * Stay within reach of a good quality health care facility; * Be aware of the symptoms of infection; and, * Seek immediate medical attention (e.g. through hotline telephone numbers) and mention their recent travel history if they develop Ebola virus disease like symptoms.

"(' In Brazil, there is an ongoing measles outbreak. From 1 January through 23 May 2018, there were 995 reported cases (Amazonas State, n=611, and Roraima State n=384). Of these cases, 114 have been laboratory confirmed (30 in Amazonas and 84 in Roraima), including two deaths. Eighty three cases were discarded and 798 remain under investigation. In Amazonas State, 611 suspected cases were reported from 1 January through 23 May 2018, of which 30 were confirmed1, 63 discarded and 518 are under investigation. In Roraima State, 384 suspected cases were reported, of which 84 were confirmed, 20 discarded and 280 are under investigation2. Of the 84 confirmed cases, 58 are among Venezuelans (69%), 24 Brazilians (28,6%), one from Guiana (1,2%) and 1 Argentinian (1,2%). Of all confirmed cases, 34 are indigenous. Two measles deaths were among Venezuelans from Boa Vista municipality. The rash onset dates of the confirmed cases in both States were from 4 February through 2 April, 2018. Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz/RJ) conducted an analysis, where they identified the genotype as D8 for all laboratory confirmed cases, which is identical to the 2017 Venezuela outbreak. Figure 1 shows the progression of the outbreak with a growing upward trend. It is important to consider that there are pending laboratory results for 798 suspected cases under investigation. An exponential increase of confirmed cases could be observed in the coming weeks. Figure 1. Reported measles cases by rash onset date, Amazonas and Roraima states, Brazil, from 1 January through 12 May, 2018. Source: Data provided by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and reproduced by PAHO/WHO. ### Public health response Actions implemented include: * Roraima and Amazonas states have started a vaccination campaign that targets six month old infants through 49-year-old age groups. * Intensified epidemiological surveillance through active and retrospective institutional case finding, contact tracing, and monitoring of contacts has been implemented. * Strengthened laboratory network. * A risk communication strategy has been implemented. * Training of health care workers in case management. ### WHO risk assessment Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains a cause of death among young children globally. Measles virus is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10–12 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one of several of the following: runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, and most people recover within two to three weeks. Case management includes vitamin A administration and antipyretics, and antibiotic and anti- diarrheal medications as needed. Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population’s immunity status. The Region of the Americas was declared free of measles in September 2016, nevertheless, outbreaks caused by imported cases from other regions may occur sporadically. The risk of spread at the national level in Brazil remains high due to the epidemiological situation and the high potential of transmission. The main challenges are vaccination coverage among immigrants and laboratory diagnostic capacity in local facilities. Because of ongoing transmission, vaccination strategies and other actions are being implemented to control the outbreak by local and federal authorities in Brazil. At the regional level, the potential impact is considered high given the performance of routine immunization programmes and prevention and control capacities in other countries in the Region. ### WHO advice On 1 September 2017, the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) shared information on this outbreak with its Member States and alerted them regarding the risk of outbreaks occurring from imported measles cases, as well as the possibility of re-introduction of the disease in areas with low vaccination coverage. In light of continuous reports of imported measles cases from other Regions and ongoing outbreaks in the Americas, PAHO/WHO urges all Member States to: * Vaccinate to maintain coverage of 95% with the first and second doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. * Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.), and international travelers. * Maintain a reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine and syringes for control of imported cases in each country in the Region. * Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of measles for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within five days of being taken. * Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the re-establishment of endemic transmission. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent and fluid communication channels between all levels (national, sub-national, and local). For more information, please see the links below: * * * 1Suspected cases were reported in 14 municipalities: Anori, Beruri, Careiro da Várzea, Humaitá, Itacoatiara, Itapiranga, Iranduba, Jutaí, Manacapuru, Manaus, Novo Airão, Parintins, São Gabriel da Cachoeira and Tefé.

"(' Since the first Disease Outbreak News on 10 May 2018 through 12 June, the primary focus of the response to Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has shifted from the urban areas of Equateur Province to remote and difficult to reach places. This shift has come after a series of concerted actions and effective measures implemented by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners. The first stage of the EVD response focused on protecting the populated town of Bikoro and the city of Mbandaka from increases in cases, which could potentially threaten major cities in the country as well as its neighbours along the river. The next stage is focused on implementing expeditionary surveillance, tracking the contacts and engaging communities in remote areas, including indigenous populations in and around the villages of Itipo and Iboko in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since 17 May 2018, no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case-patient in Iboko developed symptoms on 2 June 2018 (Figure 1). From 1 April through 10 June 2018, a total of 55 EVD cases1, including 28 deaths, have been reported from three health zones in Equateur Province. The total includes 38 confirmed, 14 probable and three suspected cases from the three health zones: Bikoro (n=22; 10 confirmed, 11 probable and one suspected cases), Iboko (n=29; 24 confirmed, three probable and two suspected cases) and Wangata (n=4; four confirmed) (Figure 2). The median age of cases was 41 years (range: 8 years–80 years) and 31 (60%) were male (Figure 3). Five cases among health care workers have been reported. As of 10 June 2018, a total of 634 contacts remain under active follow up. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by date of illness onset from 4 April through 10 June 2018 (n=52) #### Figure 2: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ebola cases per Health Zone in Equateur province from 4 April through 10 June 2018 #### Figure 3: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by age and sex from 4 April through 10 June 2018 (n=51) Age is unknown for one case. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health (MoH) is leading the response in the affected health zones with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the strengthening of surveillance and contract tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), case management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination and vaccination. Additionally, to avoid the spread of the disease from affected provinces to non-affected provinces and to other countries, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has put into place cross-border surveillance at points of entry (neighbouring, at-risk zones, provinces, countries, and at important travellers’ congregation points). WHO continues to work closely with the Ministries of Health from nine neighbouring countries to strengthen preparedness in order to mitigate the risk of international spread. * On 11 June 2018, the Director-General (DG) of WHO and the Minister of Health visited Itipo health area in Iboko Health Zone to support response operations. * Since the launch of the vaccination intervention on 21 May through 10 June, a total of 2295 people have been vaccinated in Wangata (713), Iboko (1054) and Bikoro (498). Populations eligible for ring vaccination are front-line health professionals, people who have been exposed to confirmed EVD cases (contacts) and contacts of contacts. * Early Warning, Alert and Response (EWAR) Systems and supporting electronic field data collection tools have been deployed at strategic sites to support these activities. * In the past week, the Ministry of Health, UNICEF and WHO have trained more than 60 Congolese army personnel, 65 female leaders, 50 provincial and Pygmy leaders and 100 youth leaders in Mbandaka, Bikoro and Iboko on EVD prevention. * Anthropological assessments and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys are being conducted in 11 villages in Itipo. Social mobilization and community dialogue activities are ongoing in villages in Itipo, Besefe and Loondo. * Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) has established isolation facilities in Mbandaka’s main hospital (20 beds) and Bikoro hospital (15 beds). Two Ebola treatment centres (ETC) are being set up in Iboko and Itipo. * Case management and IPC activities continue to be scaled up with the establishment, stocking and staffing of ETCs within affected areas. WHO is coordinating the deployment of multiple medical teams to support the ETCs, case referral systems and to support health facilities to remain open for non-Ebola care. * As of 12 June 2018, WHO has deployed a total of 271 technical experts in various critical functions of the Incident Management System (IMS) to support response to the EVD outbreak, including 37 experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions. A WHO anthropologist and risk communication experts have trained Ebola responders on community engagement, including safe burial and contact tracing. * As of 12 June 2018, 26 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, there are currently no restrictions of international travel in place. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event. * In collaboration with WHO, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Africa Centre for Disease Control and other partners, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has developed a comprehensive strategic response plan for points of entry (PoEs). The goal is to avoid the spread of the disease to other provinces and at the international level. A total of 30 points of entry (port and airports)and sites of congregations (markets, schools, churches and parking lot) were identified along three cordon sanitaires, including Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, Ntonde, Igende, Equateur Province, Kinshasa and Kisangani areas2. * Since 6 June 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo`s sub-commission on surveillance of POEs, continues to meet daily in order to review and strengthen screening and sensitization of EVD in the key 30 prioritized sites, including ports on the Congo river, Kinshasa international and Mbandaka airports. * The WHO Regional Strategic Plan for EVD Operational Readiness and Preparedness has been developed by WHO with Member States and partners. Phase I of the plan aims to be implemented in the next three months to enhance the capacities of the countries to respond should there be any importation of EVD cases. Phase II aims to scale up the preparedness actions to ensure sustainability of the operational readiness capacities linking to the ongoing longer term emergency preparedness and implementation of IHR core capacities. ### WHO risk assessment WHO considers the public health risk to be very high at the national level due to the serious nature of the disease, insufficient epidemiological information and the delay in the detection of initial cases, which makes it difficult to assess the magnitude and geographical extent of the outbreak. WHO has assessed the public health risk to be high at the regional level. Nine neighbouring countries, including the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, have been advised that they are at high risk of spread, and preparedness activities are being undertaken. At the global level the risk currently remains low. This risk assessment is continuously being reviewed as further information becomes available. ### WHO advice The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee was convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, and advised against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in relation to the current Ebola outbreak. Flight cancellations and other travel restrictions may hinder the international public health response and may cause significant economic damage to the affected country. The Emergency Committee also advised that exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance. However, entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value. Although the Emergency Committee stated that the conditions for a PHEIC are not currently met, the Committee issued comprehensive public health advice3. WHO travel advice was issued on 29 May 20184, aiming to sensitize travellers on how to reduce the risk of exposure and where to obtain appropriate medical assistance in case of EVD like symptoms after possible exposure , considering the risk of an international traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. In addition WHO in collaboration with transport and travel partners (ICAO, IATA) are working together to increase travellers’ awareness, vigilance on board of conveyances and points of entry and stress on the importance of establishing and maintaining a public health emergency contingency plan at POE in a multisectoral approach, pursuant to the IHR requirement. * * * 1The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are official information reported by the Ministry of Health. 2Measures implemented at these strategic points include 1) raising awareness of travellers/ population on how to avoid exposure to Ebola virus and what to do in case of EVD like symptoms, 2) detecting and managing possible EVD cases (temperature checks, health declaration form, alert, investigation and referral procedures, 3) any person with an illness consistent with EVD should not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation, 4) provision of hand hygiene and sanitation materials. 3http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/18-05-2018-statement-on-the-1st-meeting- of-the-ihr-emergency-committee-regarding-the-ebola-outbreak-in-2018 4http://www.who.int/ith/evd-travel-advice-final-29-05-2018-final.pdf?ua=1 ',)",55
"("" Since 18 May through 21 May 2018, the Mayo Oulo's Health Zone in Cameroon, reported three suspected cholera cases and no deaths in two health areas in Northern Cameroon, bordering Nigeria. These two health areas are Guirviza Health Area (n=2) and Doumo Health Area (n=1). On 18 May 2018, the first two cases (a 26 and a 30-year-old female, both in the same household) from Mbouiri Village, Guirviza Health Area, went to the Guirviza Integrated Health Center. On 19 May, the cases were admitted, and stool samples were collected and sent to the Pasteur Center in Cameroon (CPC), in Garoua, for confirmation. On 21 May, a third case, (a 30-year-old female) from Doumo Health Area went to a health facility and was admitted. A sample was sent for laboratory confirmation. All three cases reportedly consumed food items from the Nigerian side of the border, with subsequent onset of symptoms. On 23 May, CPC, in Garoua, released laboratory results, indicating one positive sample for vibrio cholera and one negative sample, among the two suspected cases from Guirviza Health Area. The third sample from Doumo was not tested due the stool sample being inadequate1 to test. All cases are females and are being clinically managed at local health facilities. Since 21 May, no new case has been reported. Guirviza and Doumo Health Areas are located in difficult to reach areas in Northern Cameroon, and may represent challenges due to extreme insecurity as a result of their proximity to the Nigerian border and the presence of the Boko Haram movement. The last notable cholera outbreak was reported in 2014, in the same region, with more than 1500 cases reported. ### Public health response WHO and partners are supporting response activities to contain the outbreak. The following response measures are ongoing: * The WHO Country Office (WCO) is strengthening surveillance. A line list of cases has been produced and distributed. Active case search in the affected areas and alerting of neighboring districts are ongoing. * Situation reports have been produced and disseminated. * As of 24 May 2018, cholera kits have been distributed. * As of 24 May 2018, WHO and partners have performed chlorination of water sites and supplies. Additionally, isolation and treatment of cases has been performed in health care facilities. * Communication and social mobilization activities are ongoing. Community health workers (CHWs) in villages and neighbourhoods are conducting advocacy and public awareness with the support of the Mayor of Mayo Oulo to increase awareness to the population. * The Governor of the Northern Region of Cameroon has organized and chaired Regional Crisis Committee Meetings. * The cholera contingency plan, which was previously developed for Northern Cameroon, has been activated, based on the confirmation of this outbreak. * Multi-stakeholder consultation meeting involving the Ministry of Health of Cameroon, WHO, Equipe Cadre de District (ECD), and the Regional Centre for the Prevention and Fight against Epidemics (CEPRLE) was held to respond to the outbreak. * As of 24 May 2018, the heads of affected areas and health centres have been briefed on case management and dissemination of case definition are ongoing. ### WHO risk assessment Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria present in faecal contaminated water or food. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context. Mayo Oulo district in the northern region of Cameroon is bounded on the west by Mubi district in Adamawa State, Nigeria, which has been at the epicenter of an ongoing cholera outbreak. The affected area is remote and in the conflict zone (Boko Haram), underreporting of the number of cases is likely. With an estimated population of over 500,000, there is likelihood of travel between the affected areas in Mayo Oulo district and Mubi district in Nigeria which is approximately 42 km away. Due to the location (between Nigeria and Chad) and porous borders, and movement of people between these areas, further spread cannot be ruled out. The existence of Central African refugees (about 21,197 people) in the Northern region of Cameroon coupled with poor sanitary and hygienic conditions, and limited access to health care and treatment in affected communities may predispose the population to further spread of the disease. There have also been some reports of insecurity in the area with repeated kidnappings, ransom demands and frequent attacks by groups of organized bandits. This security situation may have implications on response activities. The event will continue to be monitored and assessed as more information becomes available. ### WHO advice WHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, proper waste management, food safety and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Key public health communication messages should also be provided. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management should be implemented in the areas affected by the outbreak to decrease mortality. Ensuring national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to the cholera outbreak will be needed to decrease the risk of spread to new areas. As the outbreak is occurring in border areas with active population movements, WHO encourages respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Cameroon based on the information available on the current outbreak. For further information, please refer to: * * * 1When the quantity of the stool sample is not sufficient or it is not collected in the right container to keep the pathogen alive it is considered inadequate.

"(' On 8 June 2018, the Ministry of Health (MoH) for Kenya confirmed an outbreak of Rift Valley fever. The first patient was admitted to a hospital in Wajir County in north-eastern Kenya on 2 June with fever, body weakness, and bleeding from the gums and mouth. The patient reported having consumed meat from a sick animal; the patient died the same day. On 4 June, two relatives of the index patient were admitted. Blood samples were collected and sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute, one of which was confirmed positive for Rift Valley fever on 6 June. As of 16 June, a total of 26 human cases have been reported from Wajir (24 cases) and Marsabit (2 cases) counties, including seven confirmed cases and six deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) = 23%); six patients have been discharged while one is still hospitalized. A high number of deaths and abortions among livestock, including camels and goats, has been reported in Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties. People living in these counties were reportedly consuming meat from dead and sick animals. ### Public Health Response Preparedness activities for Rift Valley fever have been ongoing since February 2018 in reaction to the heavy rains and flooding in Kenya. An alert was issued to all County Directors in February 2018 and a general national alert was communicated in May 2018. The following actions have been taken since the outbreak was confirmed: * On 8 June, the MoH and Ministry of Agriculture convened an emergency meeting with the Ministry of Livestock (MoL) and key stakeholders. A health sector task force meeting was held, and partners pledged their support to Rift Valley fever control. * On 14 June, the MoH activated the Emergency Operations Centre, with an Event Manager and supporting technical team. * On 14 June, a multi-sectoral investigation teams was deployed in Wajir County to support the county health teams. Another team will soon be dispatched to support the Marsabit County team. * As part of ongoing preparedness activities, active surveillance for Rift Valley fever is being strengthened in affected and at-risk counties, as well as contact tracing in Wajir and Marsabit counties. In Wajir County, five treatment centres have been established. * Active case searching and community sensitization activities are ongoing in the affected areas. Guidelines for vector control and other informational materials have been dispatched to Wajir County, and messages are being disseminated through Community Health Volunteers. * A ban on slaughtering animals and restriction of livestock movement has been imposed in the affected areas. ### WHO risk assessment Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever are not uncommon in Kenya. The last documented outbreak occurred from November 2014 through January 2015 in north-eastern Kenya; in 2006, a large outbreak killed more than 150 people. The CFR has varied widely in documented outbreaks but the overall CFR tends to be less than 1%. Kenya’s prior experience with responding to Rift Valley fever outbreaks combined with the preparedness activities undertaken over the preceding months is of benefit. However, the high number of reported deaths and abortions in livestock is concerning, especially because the event affects nomadic communities for which diet is predominantly based on animal products. The high volume of movement of cattle and people in this area increases the risk of further spread of the outbreak both within Kenya, and to neighbouring countries. ### WHO advice Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on: * Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission resulting from unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene and wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals is recommended. * Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. In endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating. * Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and using larvicide to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, and wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers). * Restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas. * Routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to providing early warning for veterinary and public health authorities. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Kenya based on the current information available on this event.

"(' On 16 May 2018, Japan’s National International Health Regulations Focal Point (NFP) notified WHO of an ongoing outbreak of measles in Japan. On 20 March 2018, a traveller from overseas was diagnosed with measles in Okinawa prefecture, and thereafter additional cases of measles were reported from across the prefecture and later from other prefectures. In light of the situation, on 11 and 26 April 2018, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) circulated two alert notices. The national trend in notifications and reports of new measles cases from Okinawa Prefecture have both declined in recent weeks (onset date of the most recent case in Okinawa was 10 May). Okinawa Prefecture officially declared the outbreak over on 11 June, after four weeks had passed since this last case. This report provides the latest information on the epidemiologic situation of measles in Japan, including outbreak cases in Okinawa Prefecture and the other cases, and indicates the need for continued vigilance. From 1 January through 20 May 2018, 161 cases of measles were diagnosed, including 145 (90%) laboratory-confirmed cases (99 cases of measles and 46 cases of modified measles). Eighty-nine cases are male and 72 cases are female, and the median age is 29 years-old (range: 0‒58 years). Cases were reported from the following prefectures: Okinawa (88 cases); Aichi (25 cases); Fukuoka (17 cases); Tokyo (11 cases); Saitama (six cases); Ibaraki and Kanagawa (three cases from each prefecture); Yamanashi and Osaka (two cases from each prefecture); and Chiba, Shizuoka, Hyogo, and Yamaguchi (one case from each prefecture). The suspected location of infection was Japan for 136 cases, overseas for 12 cases, and unknown for the remaining 13 cases. Among the total cases, to date, information for 30 cases regarding their isolated measles virus genotype have been received through the national surveillance system; excluding one case with vaccine strain, 25 were genotype D8 and four were genotype B3. Cases of imported measles continue to occur in Japan. Japan has successfully eliminated endemic measles transmission and sustained this status since March 2015 through both high vaccination coverage and rapid detection of and response to every case of measles. In 2016, routine vaccination coverage was 97% for the first dose (one year of age) and 93% for the second dose (year before entrance to primary school, usually five years of age); serological surveys have confirmed that the proportion of antibody-positive (particle agglutination titer ≥16) individuals aged two years or more has remained at 95% or above nationally. ### Public health response Specific actions implemented by the MHLW and local governments for the ongoing situation include: * Active epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and monitoring of close contacts for all cases. * Risk communication and circulation of alerts to medical professionals, including the importance of considering measles as a possible diagnosis and implementation of appropriate infection control measures in medical settings. * Encouraging appropriate implementation of routine immunization for measles and catch-up immunization for those with low immunity against measles. ### WHO risk assessment Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that remains one of the leading causes of mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Transmission from person-to-person is airborne, as well as by direct or indirect contact of secretions (nasal, throat) of an infected person. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10–12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash for up to four days after the appearance of the rash. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, vitamin A is recommended by WHO for all children infected with measles regardless of their country of residence, as it is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality. In March 2015, Japan was verified as having achieved measles elimination (defined as interruption of endemic measles virus transmission for at least 36 months). Nevertheless, outbreaks caused by imported cases may occur sporadically. The risk of a large measles outbreak in Japan is low due to the control measures put in place and sensitive surveillance to detect cases promptly. However, the possibility of exported cases cannot be fully ruled out because of the high volume of international travellers. ### WHO advice In light of continuous reports of imported measles cases, WHO urges all Member States to: * Vaccinate to maintain homogeneous coverage of 95% with the first and second doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine in all municipalities. Conduct risk assessments to identify populations at risk of being missed by vaccination activities and proactively take corrective actions to fill immunity gaps, including development of special communication and immunization strategies as needed. * In settings with low incidence and high risk of importation of measles virus, vaccinate populations at high risk of exposure to imported measles (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.). * Ensure that policies and procedures are in place to reduce risk of hospital-associated transmission of measles, such as appropriate triage and airborne isolation of suspected measles cases; avoiding unnecessary hospitalization of mild measles cases; and ensuring that only measles-immune healthcare workers care for suspected measles cases. * Promote medical consultation prior to travel in order to vaccinate all non-immune international travellers who missed their recommended measles doses. In addition, this consultation will include information about the most important health risks, determine the need for any other vaccinations and/or medication and identify any other medical items that the traveller may require. * Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of measles for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private health care facilities and ensure that: cases are investigated within 48 hours of detection; and that adequate and appropriate laboratory specimens are collected for both serological and molecular tests at the first contact with suspected cases. Ensure that operational resources and training are adequate so that case investigations and laboratory sample transportation for case confirmation can be performed at all subnational levels. * Ensure that resources are in place at all levels so that measles outbreaks can be rapidly investigated and immunization response measures can be rapidly implemented. These contingency resources may include dedicated funds and rapid response teams; identification of flexible resources and public health personnel who may serve as surge capacity if large-scale investigation or immunization response is required; and a stock-pile reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine and supplies. Ensure that national plans and standardized operating procedures for measles outbreak response are developed and updated. For more information, please see the links below: ',)",161
"(' The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Contact tracing activities concluded on 27 June after the last people with potential exposure to the virus completed their 21-day follow-up without developing symptoms. Over 20 000 visits to contacts have been conducted by the field team throughout the outbreak. On 12 June, the last confirmed Ebola virus disease patient in Équateur Province was discharged from an Ebola treatment centre, following two negative tests on serial laboratory specimens. Before the outbreak can be declared over, a period of 42 days (two incubation periods) following the last possible exposure to a confirmed case must elapse without any new confirmed cases being detected. Until this milestone is reached, it is critical to maintain all key response pillars, including intensive surveillance to rapidly detect and respond to any resurgence. In light of progress in the response, WHO has revised the risk assessment for this outbreak (see section below). From 1 April through 3 July 2018, a total of 53 Ebola virus disease cases1 , including 29 deaths (case fatality ratio: 55%), were reported from Équateur Province. The total includes 38 laboratory-confirmed and 15 probable cases (i.e. suspected cases that died without the opportunity to collect samples for laboratory testing). Cases have been reported from three health zones: Bikoro (n=21; 10 confirmed, 11 probable), Iboko (n=28; 24 confirmed, 4 probable), Wangata (n=4; all confirmed) (Figure 2). Five cases were health care workers, of which two died. From 3 through 5 July 2018, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, conducted a strategic operations review to assess the current epidemiological situation, evaluate progress against the Ebola virus disease Strategic Response Plan, engage in initial lesson learning, and prioritize key activities and resources for continued vigilance in affected areas through to the end of the outbreak. The review included the development of a 90-day enhanced surveillance and response plan for the continuation of core activities after the end of the outbreak, as well as planning for sustaining local and national capacities for ongoing health emergency response across the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Ebola treatment centres will remain operational and continue to provide clinical care to suspected cases. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by date of illness onset, Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 1 April through 3 July 2018 (n=53) #### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 April through 3 July 2018 (n=53) ### Public health response The Ministry of Health continues to lead the response in the affected health zones with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the strengthening of surveillance and contract tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), case management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination and vaccination. Additionally, to avoid the spread of the disease from affected provinces to non-affected provinces and to other countries, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has put into place cross-border surveillance at points of entry (neighbouring at-risk zones, provinces, countries, and at important travellers’ congregation points). WHO continues to work closely with the Ministries of Health from nine neighbouring countries to strengthen preparedness to mitigate the risk of international spread. * Since the launch of the vaccination intervention on 21 May through 30 June, a total of 3330 people have been vaccinated in Iboko (1530) Wangata (893), Bikoro (779), Ingende (107), and Kinshasa (21). Populations eligible for ring vaccination include front-line health professionals, people who have been exposed to confirmed Ebola virus disease cases (contacts) and contacts of contacts. A total of 2020 vaccine doses are available in the central vaccine stores and 870 doses are in Mbandaka. * Intensive surveillance activities are ongoing, including active case searching at the community and health facility levels, real-time investigation of alerts, and laboratory testing of all suspected cases to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. From 13 May through 3 July, 728 alerts were investigated and 387 individuals meeting the suspected case definition were tested. * WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to establish a one year programme for care to survivors. The programme will be focused on three axes: clinical follow-up, counselling and semen testing, and psychosocial support. A workshop to launch the project will be held in Mbandaka from 6 through 7 July. * Risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement activities continue in the area with support for active community-based alerts for epidemic prone diseases, addressing rumours related to Ebola virus disease and reduction of stigma against survivors. * As of 6 July, WHO has deployed a total of 332 (217 international, 115 national) technical experts in various critical functions of the Incident Management System (IMS) to support response to the Ebola virus disease outbreak, including 20 experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions. * WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event. As of 6 July, no restriction of international traffic was put in place. Based on informal sources available publicly, 25 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from Democratic Republic of the Congo during this outbreak. * To date, no exported cases have been reported. The risk of missed cases able to travel outside of Équateur Province and internationally during the incubation period (2 to 21 days) is considered very low. However, it was decided to maintain exit screening at points of entry and congregation sites as a precautionary measure and to prepare a deactivation plan for after the end of the outbreak. ### WHO risk assessment On 3 July 2018, WHO reviewed the level of public health risk associated with the current outbreak. The latest assessment concluded that the current Ebola virus disease outbreak has largely been contained, considering that over 21 days (one maximum incubation period) have elapsed since the last laboratory- confirmed case was discharged and that contact tracing activities ended on 27 June 2018. However, there remains a risk of resurgence from potentially undetected transmission chains and possible sexual transmission of the virus by male survivors. It is therefore, critical to maintain all key response pillars until the end of the outbreak is declared. Strengthened surveillance mechanisms and a survivor monitoring program are in place to mitigate, rapidly detect and respond to respond to such events. Based on these factors, WHO considers the public health risk to be moderate at the national level. In the absence of ongoing transmission, the probability of exported cases is low and diminishing, and has been further mitigated by the undertaking of preparedness activities and establishment of contingency plans in neighbouring countries. WHO has assessed the public health risk to be low at the regional and global levels. ### WHO advice The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee was convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, and advised against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in relation to the current Ebola outbreak. Flight cancellations and other travel restrictions may hinder the international public health response and may cause significant economic damage to the affected country. The Emergency Committee also advised that exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance. However, entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value. Although the Emergency Committee stated that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) are not currently met, the Committee issued comprehensive public health advice2 . WHO travel advice was issued on 29 May 20183 , aiming to sensitize travellers on how to reduce the risk of exposure and where to obtain appropriate medical assistance in case of Ebola virus disease like symptoms after possible exposure. .In general the risk of an international traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. * * * 1The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results.

"(' As 42 days (two incubation periods) have passed since the last possible exposure to a confirmed Ebola virus disease case, on 24 July 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga announced the end of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, commends the country and partners in the response against the outbreak while urging them to extend this success to combatting other diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In contrast to previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks in the country, this outbreak involved three health zones, including an urban centre with river connections to the capital and to neighbouring countries, as well as remote rainforest villages. Within hours of the outbreak being declared on 8 May 2018, WHO advanced more than US$2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, deployed a team to augment capacity in the field, and activated an emergency incident management system. More than two-thirds of the 360 people deployed to respond came from within the WHO African Region, including vaccination teams from Guinea. From 20 through 21 July 2018, WHO supported a workshop to harmonize, reconcile and validate the wide range of data arising from the outbreak response. The workshop brought together teams responsible for coordination, surveillance, case management, laboratory investigations and vaccinations in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Itipo, Iboko and Kinshasa to share their findings, and harmonize data records. As a result of this exercise, changes to the number of confirmed and probable cases, including deaths among these cases, were agreed. These changes only affected the reclassification of data records of past cases, who were otherwise known to field investigators and received full follow-up as part of the response. As of 24 July 2018, a total of 54 Ebola virus disease cases (38 confirmed and 16 probable) were reported, with illness onset between 5 April and 2 June 2018 (Figure 1). Of these cases, 33 died (overall case fatality ratio: 61%), including 17 deaths among confirmed cases. Cases were reported from three health zones (Figure 2): Bikoro (n=21; 10 confirmed, 11 probable), Iboko (n=29; 24 confirmed, 5 probable), and Wangata (n=4; all confirmed). Seven cases were health care workers, of whom two died. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by epidemiological week of illness onset, Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 5 April through 24 July 2018 (n=54) #### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 5 April through 24 July 2018 (n=54) ### Public health response From 3 through 5 July 2018, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, conducted a strategic operations review to assess the current epidemiological situation, evaluate progress against the Ebola virus disease Strategic Response Plan, engage in initial lesson learning, and prioritize key activities and resources for continued vigilance in affected areas. A key product of the operations review was the development of a government-led Consolidation and Stabilization Plan (August – October 2018) to transition resources deployed, strengthen emergency response capacity and preparedness, and overall resilience of the health systems. This plan includes: * Maintaining and strengthening surveillance capacity to rapidly detect and respond to potential new cases of Ebola virus disease, including for points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and in neighbouring provinces and countries; * Strengthening infection prevention and control, as well as Water, Sanitation, and Health (WASH), in targeted health facilities; * Maintaining evidence-based standards for case management (clinical care of patients and access to monitored use of investigational therapeutics); * Maintaining local laboratory capacity for confirmation of new potential cases and management of care to survivors; * Providing health services and psychosocial care for survivors and their families; * Strengthening community engagement to improve knowledge of and response to Ebola and epidemic-prone diseases in targeted health zones; * Improving food security in health zones affected by Ebola virus disease; * Leveraging resources and knowledge from the first two phases of the response to facilitate the development of a National Health Security and Resilience Plan, based on previous assessments and the after action review which is planned from 10 through 14 September 2018. As part of this next phase of the public health response, WHO will support the Ministry of Health in leading an After-Action Review with partners and donors to engage in lessons learning and determine how best to leverage resources and knowledge from the first two phases of the response to strengthen health systems and national resilience under a National Action Plan for Heath Security. ### WHO risk assessment The latest WHO assessment concluded that the current Ebola virus disease outbreak has been contained, considering that 42 days (two maximum incubation periods) have elapsed since the date of the second negative test of the last case confirmed case on 12 June 2018. Under the Consolidation and Stabilisation Strategic Plan adopted by the Ministry for Health, enhanced surveillance, a program for long-term Ebola survivor care and other response mechanisms, remain in place following the end of the outbreak declaration to maintain increased vigilance and contribute to resilience of the health system. WHO considers the public health risk associated with the recent Ebola virus disease outbreak to be low at national, regional and global levels. Ebola virus disease is, however, endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and may re-emerge at any time. ### WHO advice WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce Ebola virus disease transmission: * Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption. * Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home. * Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission, based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for Ebola virus. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available evidence. WHO has monitored travel and trade restrictions during this outbreak, and recorded 26 countries that put in place entry screening measures, while no country has implemented any travel or trade restrictions, as recommended by the Emergency Committee.

"(' On 28 July 2018, the North Kivu Provincial Health Division notified the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a cluster of suspected acute haemorrhagic fever cases. On 1 August 2018, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa reported that four of six samples collected from hospitalised patients tested positive by GeneXpert automated PCR. These presumptive positive tests prompted an immediate escalation of response activities by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, and the declaration of the outbreak by the Minister of Health. The prompt alert by the Ministry of Health to WHO, under the International Health Regulations, followed the detection and rapid investigation of a cluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in a family in North Kivu Province during mid to late July 2018. Local health officials have since identified sporadic, antecedent deaths in the community since May 2018 (tentatively classified as probable cases), which are subject to ongoing investigations to determine if they are related to the current outbreak. The Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are working to establish the full extent of this outbreak. As of 3 August 2018, a total of 43 Ebola virus disease cases (13 confirmed and 30 probable), including 33 deaths, have been reported. An additional 33 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. Three healthcare workers have been affected, of whom one has died. Geographically, confirmed and probable cases are currently localised to five health zones in North Kivu Province (38 cases, including 13 confirmed and 25 probable), and one health zone in Ituri Province (5 probable cases) (Figure 1). Suspected cases are currently under investigation in one additional health zone of Ituri Province. The affected areas host over one million displaced people and shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda, with frequent cross border movement due to trade activities. The prolonged humanitarian crisis and deterioration of the security situation is expected to hinder response to this outbreak. Further laboratory testing by INRB has detected Ebolavirus using conventional PCR in three of the initial batch of six samples from Mabalako Health Zone. These results are highly suggestive that Ebola Zaire species is the cause of this outbreak; however, genetic sequencing is necessary to definitively confirm the virus species. Characterization of viral sequences will help to inform the potential use of vaccines and therapeutics, and any link to the recent outbreak in Équateur Province – located in the far west of the country, some 2 500 km from the current outbreak. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that these events are related. Figure 1: Ebola virus disease by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 3 August 2018 ### Public health response The Ministry of Health has initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. In addition, the potential for use of Ebola vaccines, as well as therapeutics for treatment of Ebola virus disease, are being reviewed. * The Ministry of Health and WHO have deployed Rapid Response Teams to the affected health zones to initiate response activities. * WHO has activated country, regional and global coordination mechanisms to assess risks and respond accordingly to the event. An incident management team has been established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and support teams have been reactivated at the WHO Regional Office for Africa and at headquarters. Coordination meetings with Ministry of Health and partners were held on 1 August 2018 for deployment of human resources and material. Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established, and a full response plan is being developed. * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and partners in the activation of a multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response. * With support of international partners, Ebola treatment centres are being established in Mangina, Beni and Goma. * A mobile laboratory has been established in Beni to facilitate timely diagnoses of suspected cases. The establishment of additional laboratory capacities elsewhere is being explored. * Contact tracing activities have been initiated. Thus far, 879 contacts have been registered for follow-up. * The Regional Emergency Director for Africa has informed neighbouring countries (Rwanda and Uganda) of the outbreak and emphasized the importance of surveillance and preparedness actions, especially along the border. * Activities to sensitize communities to the outbreak, and hygiene and sanitation measures, through media and churches have begun in affected communities, and in neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda. * On 1 August, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Operational Support Team has issued an alert to its network partners, providing an overview of the current situation and ongoing response activities. On 2 August, the GOARN Steering Committee and WHO Regional Office for Africa conducted a joint coordination call for operational partners in Africa. GOARN partners continue to contribute to response activities. ### WHO risk assessment This new outbreak of Ebola virus disease is affecting north eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk is considered high at the national and regional levels and low globally. ### WHO advice As investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries to ensure health authorities are alerted and prepared to respond. WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

"(' As of 17 July 2018, a total of 19 Nipah virus (NiV) cases, including 17 deaths, were reported from Kerala State: 18 of the cases were laboratory- confirmed and the deceased index case was suspected to have NiV but could not be tested. The outbreak was localized to two districts in Kerala State: Kozhikode and Malappuram. No new cases or deaths have been reported since 1 June 2018 and, as of 30 July, human-to-human transmission of NiV has been contained in Kerala State. As reported in the Disease Outbreak News published on 31 May 2018, three deaths due to NiV infection were reported on 19 May from Kozhikode District, Kerala State. Three of the four reported deaths were confirmed positive for NiV by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM ELISA for NiV. Two patients recovered completely and were discharged from the hospital. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis were observed among the patients infected. This was the first NiV outbreak reported in Kerala State and the third NiV outbreak known to have occurred in India; the two previous outbreaks occurred in the state of West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. ### Public health response #### Government response * A multi-disciplinary central team from the National Centre for Disease Control was sent to Kerala to investigate and respond, in close coordination with state government officials. * More than 2600 contacts were identified and followed up during the outbreak. All symptomatic contacts were investigated and tested for NiV. * Syndromic surveillance was enhanced in Kerala State. Hospital and community surveillance were also strengthened in Kerala. The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Manipal Hospital and the National Institute of Virology conducted laboratory testing to confirm and rule out cases. * The central team provided Kerala officials with the following guidelines and reference materials for Nipah virus, which were made publically available during the outbreak: case definitions; guidelines for hospital infection prevention and control; guidelines for sample collection and transportation; clinical management guidelines for suspected and confirmed cases; guidelines for safe disposal of dead bodies of confirmed Nipah virus cases; and information for the general public and for health care personnel. Risk communication messages were delivered to the community, public, partners and other stakeholders. * Training and capacity building for health care personnel were done in the following areas: sample collection and transportation; safe disposal of dead bodies; contact tracing; hospital waste management; hospital infection prevention and control; and the use of personal protective equipment. * The government coordinated amongst all relevant sectors including zoonoses, wildlife, animal husbandry, human health, clinicians, pulmonologists, neurologists and private sector. * The Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC) at the National Centre for Disease Control was activated to monitor the outbreak. * The Ministry of Health provided the Kerala government with 5000 personal protective equipment kits and 100 body bags. * Samples from animals (bats, pigs, cows, and goats) tested at National High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory at Bhopal early in the outbreak tested negative for NiV. Later, Pteropus giganteus bats (the reservoir of NiV infection) were collected from areas around the house of the index case in Kozhikode, Kerala to understand the circulation of NiV in bats in the affected area; 19% (10 of 52) of the bats were found positive by RT-PCR for NiV. #### WHO response * As per the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the event was notified to WHO on 23 May 2018 and WHO published a Disease Outbreak News on 31 May 2018. * WHO provided technical materials and guidance on Nipah virus disease to the Ministry of Health and Kerala State health authorities, and provided technical support to the Ministry of Health. * WHO continues to work closely with the Ministry of Health to strengthen overall indicator- and event-based surveillance for epidemic-prone diseases and strengthen overall IHR (2005) capacities. * WHO is also working with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to advance the research agenda for the Nipah research and development (R&D) blueprint. WHO will continue working closely with the Ministry of Health to ensure that health systems preparedness for emerging zoonoses is strengthened in the country. ### WHO risk assessment NiV infection is an emerging zoonotic disease of public health importance in the WHO South-East Asia Region with a high case fatality rate estimated to range between 40 and 75%; however, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. NiV was first recognized in 1998-1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. No subsequent outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia or Singapore since 1999. NiV was first recognized in India and Bangladesh in 2001; since then, nearly annual outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh. The disease has been identified periodically in eastern India (2001, 2007). Limited human-to-human transmission of NiV can occur among unprotected family members and health workers who treat infected patients. Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are the natural reservoirs of NiV. Possible routes of transmission of NiV include consumption of fruit contaminated by the saliva of infected bats, from direct contact with infected bats or their feces/urine, or human-to-human transmission through unprotected close contact with an infected patient in the community or hospital. Many cases identified in the current outbreak were infected through direct unprotected contact with other infected persons. This outbreak is the third Nipah virus outbreak in India. The country demonstrated its capacity to rapidly contain the outbreak, including by the identification of cases, verifying cases with laboratory testing and caring for patients. ### WHO advice Currently, there is no evidence of NiV infection in humans in Kerala State; however, surveillance for NiV in humans and fruit bats should be maintained in endemic areas. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on India based on the information currently available on this event. Currently, there are no specific treatments available for Nipah virus disease and care is supportive. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications. NiV infection can be prevented by avoiding exposure to bats and sick pigs in endemic areas, and by avoiding consuming fruits partially-eaten by infected bats or drinking raw date palm sap/toddy/juice. The risk of international transmission via fruit contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption. Fruit with signs of bat bites should be discarded. In health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for a patient suspected to have NiV fever should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing. Research is needed to better understand the ecology of bats and NiV. ',)",19
"(' On 1 August 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease in North Kivu Province, in the eastern part of the country. North Kivu is among the most populated provinces in the country, shares borders with Uganda and Rwanda, and experiences conflict and insecurity, with over one million internally displaced people and migration of refugees to neighbouring countries. The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners are continuing to strengthen activities across all key response pillars. As of 7 August 2018, 44 Ebola virus disease cases (17 confirmed and 27 probable), including 36 deaths, have been reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. This includes sporadic, antecedent deaths in affected communities since May 2018, which were identified from clinical records and tentatively classified as probable cases pending further investigations. Two healthcare workers (one confirmed and one probable) have been affected, of which one has died. Confirmed or probable cases are localised to five health zones in North Kivu, and one neighbouring health zone in Ituri Province. The majority of cases (13 confirmed, 21 probable) have been reported from Mabalako Health Zone (Figure 1). An additional 47 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. On 6 August 2018, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) confirmed by genetic sequencing that this latest outbreak is caused by the Zaire ebolavirus species, and is not related to the recent outbreak in Équateur Province. For more information, see: #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 7 August 2018 ### Public health response The Ministry of Health has initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. * On 2 August 2018, the Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the WHO Representative and representatives of several partner agencies visited Mabalako Health Zone (the epicentre of the outbreak) and Beni to assess and support the local response. * The Ministry of Health and WHO have deployed Rapid Response Teams to the affected health zones to initiate response activities. As of 7 August, WHO has deployed 30 technical and logistics specialists to support response activities. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the WHO response to Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in nine bordering countries. * On 8 August, the vaccination of frontline health care workers started, followed by the vaccination of community contacts and their contacts. There are currently 3220 doses of rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine available in Kinshasa. A clinical team with therapeutics arrived on 7 August. * Ebola treatment centres have been established in Mangina and Beni, with the support of international partners. The deployment of experienced clinicians to support partners in caring for patients is in process. * On 3 August 2018, two GeneXpert machines were set up in Beni to facilitate the timely diagnosis of suspected cases. The establishment of additional laboratory capacity elsewhere is being explored, including additional GeneXpert machines in Mangina, Goma and other areas as needed. The INRB is working to deploy additional diagnostic capacities in Mangina, including conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology, haematology and biochemistry. * The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is supporting the Democratic Republic of the Congo Red Cross to establish systems to ensure safe and dignified burials throughout the affected zones. Currently, two teams are operating from Beni and are covering the affected areas. * The WHO Regional Emergency Director for Africa has informed neighbouring countries (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and South Sudan) of the outbreak and emphasized the need for heightened surveillance and preparedness actions in the respective countries, particularly along the border with North Kivu. * Thirty-two key points of entry have been identified in which to strengthen capacity to rapidly detect and respond to potential new Ebola virus disease cases and to engage communities along border areas to improve knowledge of Ebola virus disease and its prevention. * Activities to sensitize communities to the outbreak began in affected communities through the Social Mobilization Commission, and in neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda. WHO and partners have held a series of briefings with community and neighbourhood leaders, teachers, religious leaders, journalists, and community groups to raise awareness about Ebola, including information on the current outbreak and preventive measures. * As of 8 August, three charter cargo planes from Mbandaka arrived in Beni with a total of 23 tonnes of supplies. A further charter is scheduled to depart Dubai with 20 000 sets of viral haemorrhagic fever Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and 50 000 sets of standard PPE. ### WHO risk assessment This latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease is affecting north eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which are in close proximity to Uganda. Potential risk factors for transmission of Ebola virus disease at national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the implementation of response activities.

"(' On 1 August 2018, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the town of Mangina, Mabalako Health Zone, North Kivu Province. Confirmed cases have since between reported from Beni and Mandima health zones, Ituri Province; however, all confirmed exposures and transmission events to date have been linked back to the outbreak epi-centre, Mangina. North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the country, share borders with Uganda and Rwanda, and experience conflict and insecurity, with over one million internally displaced people and migration of refugees to neighbouring countries. As of 15 August 2018, 78 EVD cases (51 confirmed and 27 probable), including 44 deaths, have been reported.1 Since the DON published on 9 August, 34 new confirmed cases have been reported: seven from Ituri Province (Mandima Health Zone) and 27 from North Kivu Province (one in Beni and 26 in Mabalako health zones). The 78 confirmed or probable cases reside in five health zones in North Kivu and one health zone in Ituri. The majority of cases (39 confirmed and 21 probable) have been reported from Mangina in Mabalako Health Zone (Figure 1). As of 15 August, 24 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude EVD. Eight new confirmed cases among health care workers have been reported, bringing the total number of infected health care workers to 10 (nine confirmed and one probable deceased case). These health care workers were likely exposed in clinics, not Ebola treatment centres (ETCs), many of which may have been infected before the declaration of the outbreak. WHO and partners are working to increase awareness of Ebola among health care and other frontline workers, and to strengthen infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. The MoH, WHO and partners continue to systematically monitor and rapidly investigate all alerts in other provinces and in neighbouring countries. Since the last DON was published, alerts in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as in Uganda, Rwanda, and the Central African Republic were investigated; EVD was ruled out for all. For more information, see: #### Figure 1. Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 15 August 2018 ### Public health response The MoH rapidly initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. * During a two-day mission to the outbreak epi-centre, the WHO Director-General (DG), WHO Regional Director (RD) for Africa and WHO Deputy Director-General (DDG), Emergency Preparedness and Response, together with the Minister of Health, observed the launch of Ebola vaccination activities, visited the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), met with partners and staff to discuss the challenges ahead, and assessed response measures and needs. * The WHO DG and the RD then visited Uganda where they were briefed by the WHO Representative on the country’s EVD preparedness. The DG and RD later met the Uganda Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Health, and the Minister of State for Primary Health Care to discuss EVD preparedness and WHO support. * The MoH has activated a multi-partner incident management system and an EOC to coordinate the response, with the main centre in Beni and the field coordination centre in Mangina. WHO has established an incident management team with personnel from the WHO Country Office, Regional Office for Africa and headquarters who are collaborating closely to ensure a comprehensive and effective response to the outbreak. * On 8 August, the MoH, with support from WHO and partners, launched the Ebola ring vaccination activities for high-risk populations. In the first days, health care and other frontline workers were vaccinated. As of 15 August, a total of five rings have been defined around 13 recently confirmed cases. Within these initial rings, more than 500 contacts and their contacts consented and received rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine thus far. Teams are continuing to identify and vaccinate all eligible contacts to help interrupt transmission of the virus. * The MoH and WHO continue to strengthen surveillance in the affected and surrounding areas. As of 15 August, nearly 1600 contacts, including more than 120 health workers, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been registered and are being followed up on daily basis. * As of 15 August, WHO has deployed over 100 technical and logistics specialists to support response activities. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in bordering countries. For more information about operational readiness and preparedness activities, please see the DON published on 14 August. * In addition to the mobile laboratory established in Beni on 3 August, local testing with Xpert Ebola has since been established in hospital facilities in Beni, Goma, and Mangina to facilitate the timely diagnosis of suspected cases. * The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have established 60-bed ETCs in Beni and Mangina, respectively. The partners are preparing the ETCs to provide therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with MoH and Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical expertise support on site and assisting with the creation of a data safety management board. * The MoH team, with support from UNICEF, are training 90 psychosocial agents to provide psychosocial care to patients and other affected people. * Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys were conducted in Beni and Mabalako health zones to assess the levels of EVD awareness in the communities. Findings from the survey will be used to improve the risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement strategy. * Two planes with supplies of cold chain equipment, isolation units and vehicles arrived in Beni on 11 and 12 August. ### WHO risk assessment This latest outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo which border Uganda. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally. ### WHO advice The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) working group on Ebola vaccines and the SAGE members have reviewed the epidemiological situation and the evidence available with regard to the different candidate Ebola vaccines and the impact of different interventions. While ring vaccination remains the preferred strategy (as stated in the April 2017 SAGE report, a geographic targeted approach was proposed as an exceptional alternative if the ring vaccination around a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola proves unfeasible. The following interim recommendation was agreed upon: “Should an Ebola disease outbreak occur before the candidate vaccine is licensed, SAGE recommended that the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine be promptly deployed under the Expanded Access framework, with informed consent and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. If the outbreak is caused by an Ebola virus species other than Zaire, consideration should be given to the use of other candidate vaccines that target the putative viral species”. For more information, see: As investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak and the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond. WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. For more information, see: * * * 1The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results. ',)",78
"(' On 14 August 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) received information from the WHO Regional Office for Europe about a confirmed yellow fever case in French Guiana. On 10 August 2018, the French National Reference Centre for arboviruses (Institut Pasteur de la Guyane) reported an autochthonous (locally acquired) laboratory confirmed case of yellow fever in an unvaccinated 47-year-old Swiss man in French Guiana. Since April 2018, the case patient has lived in a forest area in the commune of Roura in French Guiana. On 4 August 2018, he developed flu-like symptoms, and on 8 August 2018 he was hospitalized in Cayenne, French Guiana, with fulminant hepatitis. On 9 August 2018, he was transferred to Paris, France where he received a liver transplant. Epidemiological and entomological investigations have been conducted and no additional cases have been identified in the area of the patient’s accommodation. During contract tracing it was revealed that contacts of the case-patient did not report any unusual non-human primate mortality. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was conducted at the French National Reference Centre and was positive for yellow fever. ### Public health response French Guiana health authorities are implementing several public health measures: * Vector control measures have been strengthened around the risk zone (accommodation, health care facilities and airport). * Information has been disseminated to health care workers to raise awareness about yellow fever. * Messages on prevention measures for yellow fever are being disseminated in French Guiana through mass media campaigns (press release, radio) for local awareness and the promotion of vaccination. * Control of immunization status of travelers is being reinforced. ### WHO risk assessment Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause a serious public health impact in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection. French Guiana is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission and a yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travelers over one (1) year of age. Vaccination coverage in French Guiana is optimal; however, the coverage in some populations could be suboptimal and therefore these populations may be at risk for yellow fever infections. ### WHO advice Advice to travelers planning to visit, or reside in, areas at risk for yellow fever transmission includes: * Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. * Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites. * Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever. * Promotion of health care seeking behaviour while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e., where the competent vector is present). This report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with a favourable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission. WHO, therefore, reminds Members States to strengthen the control of immunization status of travelers to all potentially endemic areas. Viraemic returning travelers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities. WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restriction be applied to French Guiana based on the information available for this event. ',)",1
"(' On 8 September 2018, the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) National Focal Point (NFP) of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of a laboratory- confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The case is a 61-year-old male Korean national who visited Kuwait on business from 16 August through 6 September 2018. He returned to Korea via Dubai. On 28 August, while in Kuwait, he experienced diarrhoea. On 3 September his symptoms worsened and he visited a local hospital on 4 and 6 September. On 7 September, he returned to Korea and presented to a general hospital in Seoul with diarrhoea and fever. A diagnosis of pneumonia was made, and due to his travel history, MERS was suspected. He was immediately isolated, transferred to the Seoul National University Hospital where he was immediately placed in an isolation ward. The patient is currently in a stable condition. A sputum sample was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on 8 September at the laboratory of Seoul Provincial Institute of Public Health and Environment. Viral isolation is being performed. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health in the Republic of Korea is closely monitoring 21 individuals who had close contact with the patient: family members, individuals who were seated near the patient during travel, flight attendants, close contacts while in Seoul and four health care workers. All identified contacts have been placed in quarantine at home and are currently asymptomatic; they will be monitored by local public health centres for 14 days after exposure to the patient. In addition, up to 435 individuals, including the passengers on the flight, were or are under passive surveillance. Health authorities in the Republic of Korea have been in contact with the Ministry of Health in Kuwait. The epidemiological investigation of the patient’s exposures and travel history in Kuwait is ongoing. WHO is working with Ministry officials in the Republic of Korea, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates and providing technical advice and guidance for investigations in the three Member States to determine the patient’s movements, exposures and to minimize the occurrence of secondary infections. ### WHO risk assessment The virus does not pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Community-acquired human infections with MERS-CoV have occurred from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV can also transmit between humans, through unprotected contact with an infected person. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. Human-to-human transmission can be stopped with adequate infection prevention and control measures. The notification of a confirmed case in the Republic of Korea does not change WHO’s overall global risk assessment for MERS. As a result of comprehensive contact tracing and testing of high risk contacts, additional cases may be identified in relation to this one case. Additional infections identified as part of the ongoing public health response will not change the overall global public health risk, which is low. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that sporadic cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who have acquired the infection after exposure to infected animals, animal products or human cases (for example, in a health care setting). To date, no cases have been associated with Hajj. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. WHO recommends the collection of exposure information, including recent travel history, contact with dromedary camels and visits to health care facilities in countries where MERS-CoV is circulating. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are nonspecific. Therefore, health care workers should consistently apply standard precautions with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Community and household awareness of MERS and MERS prevention measures in the home may reduce household transmission and prevent community clusters. People with underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, or who are immunocompromised are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise any screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions, such as quarantine or travel bans. WHO recommends that travellers to or from Middle East be informed on preventive measures to avoid exposure to MERS-CoV and when or where to seek medical attention in case of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Information can be provided via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators or at points of entry. WHO also recommends that routine core capacity requirements are in place at designated points of entry. If a passenger on board an aircraft has symptoms suggestive of MERS-CoV infection, the pilot should follow the International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines for infection control and notify public health authorities at the destination airport via air traffic control, in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Authority Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Air Traffic Management (ICAO PANS-ATM). As of August 2018, the total global number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported to WHO since 2012 is 2249, including 798 MERS-CoV associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under the IHR (2005); the total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of through follow up with affected Member States.

"(' On 23 August 2018, the Algerian Ministry of Health (MoH) announced an outbreak of cholera in northern parts of the country, in and around the capital province Algiers. From 7 August to 6 September, 217 cases with cholera-like symptoms have been hospitalized, two of the patients died (CFR: 0.9%). Cases have been reported from seven provinces (Wilayas). Of these, 83 have been confirmed as Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 Ogawa at the Institut Pasteur Algiers. More than half of the confirmed cases have been registered in Blida Province, followed by Algiers, Tipaza, Bouira, Médéa and Ain Defla. A total of 21, including three private, water sources in the affected areas were tested for bacterial contamination, and 10 of these were deemed inappropriate for human consumption. One of the water sources tested positive for V. cholerae and was condemned for human consumption. ### Public health response * The MoH has reported there is sufficient capacity within the hospitals to treat the cholera patients. Patients are being treated at two provincial hospitals in the affected areas. According to the information from the MoH as of 3 September, 10 cases remained hospitalized. The remaining cases have been discharged. * Surveillance and active case searching around the identified cases are ongoing and have been intensified by the MoH. * The public water supply in Algeria is tested on a daily basis; all samples collected have tested negative for enteric pathogens. * Following a request from Institut Pasteur Algiers, WHO sent 5000 rapid diagnostic tests to Algeria. ### WHO risk assessment Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of water or food contaminated with V. cholerae bacteria. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high rates of morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context. The last confirmed case of V. cholerae infection in Algeria was reported in 1996. The current outbreak developed rapidly with 41 confirmed cases reported between 7 and 23 August, and an average of four cases reported daily from 24 to 30 August. The source of the outbreak and transmission vehicle is currently not known but the MoH and Institut Pasteur Algeria reported that most of the cases were clustered within a family group. Cases have been reported in an urban setting where there is an increased risk of transmission, especially as the source of the outbreak has not been identified and therefore the source may still persist as a risk in the community. However, the most recent information published by the MoH suggests that the outbreak is receding. ### WHO advice For this outbreak, further analysis of the laboratory-confirmed specimens is recommended, including sequencing for the cholera toxin gene, to identify if the outbreak is due to an epidemic strain of V. cholerae. For preventing and controlling cholera, WHO recommends proper waste management, implementing adequate food safety and hygienic practices and ensuring access to safe water and sanitation. Key public health messages should be provided to the affected population. Reinforcement of surveillance is advised. Appropriate case management should be implemented in the areas affected by the outbreak to decrease mortality. Ensuring national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to the cholera outbreak will be needed to mitigate the risk of spread to new areas. WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to Algeria based on the information currently available in relation to this outbreak. For further information, please refer to: ',)",217
"("" On 15 July, the outbreak of cholera was officially declared by the Ministry of Public Health of Niger. The first three cases were residents of Nigeria from Jibiya Local Government Area (LGA) in Katsina State on the border with Niger. The cases were all from the same family and reportedly had an onset of symptoms in Jibiya LGA before seeking treatment on 5 July 2018 at a health facility in a bordering town in Niger. Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 Inaba was confirmed in stool samples from all three cases, one of which died within minutes of admission. In addition to these cases, six cases were reported in the following two days from villages in Niger located approximately 4km away from Jibiya LGA. Since then, the outbreak has continuously expanded geographically and in magnitude with peaks of around 400 cases reported in two weeks in August and in early September. As of 1 October 2018, 3692 cases (14% of these were cases in Nigerian residents seeking care in Niger) with 68 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.8%) have been reported from twelve health districts in four regions: Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua, and Zinder. Four affected districts (Aguié, Guidam Roumji, Madarounfa, and Maradi commune) in Maradi Region and two affected districts (Birni Koni, and Mabalza) in Tahoua Region are on the border with Nigeria, while Gaya District in Dosso Region is close to the border with both Benin and Nigeria. Overall, 34 cases from four regions have been confirmed for Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba at the Centre for Medical and Health Research (CERMES) in Niamey: Dosso Region (1), Zinder Region (3), Maradi Region (10) and Tahoua region (20). Poor sanitary conditions in the affected areas have been implicated in the spread of the outbreak. Frequent population movement between Niger and neighbouring Katsina State in Nigeria, which is also experiencing an upsurge in cases of cholera, is likely impacting on the outbreak. ### Public health response The following public health response sections have been implemented: * Multisectoral cholera outbreak coordination structures have been set up at the district, regional and national levels. A regular National Epidemic Management Committee (NEMC) meeting is being held under the leadership of the Ministry of Health (MoH).In addition, WHO is finalizing the WHO action plan to support the MoH. * WHO is supporting the deployment of eight epidemiologists to the Maradi and Tahoua regions to support surveillance activities. * Surveillance activities are being scaled up with support from WHO and other partners and the daily reporting and line listing of cases have been established. * Cholera treatment centres have been put in place by the Ministry of Health with the support of Médecins Sans Frontières, and the Non-governmental Organization (NGO) ALIMA (partnered with the local NGO Bien Être de la Femme et l'Enfant au Niger (BEFEN)). In total, six treatment sites have been set up in the affected districts and initial medical supplies have been dispatched. Niger has laboratory capacity through the national laboratory (CERMES) which confirmed Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 Inaba. * Social mobilization and risk communication activities are being scaled-up with support from UNICEF and Niger Red Cross, focusing on hygiene messages. * Currently, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities are focusing on the distribution of aqua tabs. ### WHO risk assessment The current outbreak started in Madarounfa district in Maradi Region, one of the known hotspots for cholera along the Niger – Nigeria border, and has since spread to three geographically dispersed regions, including some of the most affected districts during previous cholera outbreaks. These areas are classified as high-risk areas for the spread of cholera given the presence of local risk factors such as poor hygiene and sanitary conditions coupled with significant population movement and trade between these districts and neighbouring areas in Nigeria. With the ongoing rainy season and the increase in cases in neighbouring Katsina State in Nigeria, the potential for further spread of the disease both within Niger and across the border with Nigeria is high. The population in the capital city Niamey as well as neighbouring Benin are at risk of being affected given the confirmation of cases in the Dosso Region which is a major trading hub on the border with Benin but also links the capital city Niamey. The bridge connecting Niger to Benin across the Niger River close to Gaya town has collapsed on 5 September, which may slow down population movement across this particular border but also forces the population to travel longer distances (possibly through Burkina Faso and Nigeria) to maintain economic and personal links with the other countries in the region. The recent upsurge of cholera cases in Borno State in Nigeria also puts the population in Niger’s Diffa Region at risk given porous borders and mass movement in this area. The last major cholera outbreak reported in Niger occurred in 2014 and involved more than 2000 cases. ### WHO advice WHO recommends proper and timely case management in Cholera Treatment Centres. Improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities, are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with the international community based on the information available on the current outbreak.

"(' Since the last Disease Outbreak News was published on 20 September (with data as of 15 September), an additional 4914 cases have been reported including 92 laboratory-confirmed cases. The cholera outbreak in Harare was declared by the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) of Zimbabwe on 6 September 2018 and notified to WHO on the same day. As of 3 October 2018, 8535 cumulative cases, including 163 laboratory-confirmed cases, and 50 deaths have been reported (case fatality rate: 0.6%). Of these 8535 cases, 98% (8341 cases) were reported from the densely populated capital Harare (Figure 1). The most affected suburbs in Harare are Glen View and Budiriro. Of the 8340 cases for which age is known, the majority (56%) are aged between 5 and 35 years old. Males and females have been equally affected by the outbreak. From 4 September through 3 October, the majority of deaths were reported from health care institutions. The pathogen is known to be Vibrio cholera O1 serotype Ogawa. Since confirmation on 6 September 2018, a multi-drug resistant strain has been identified and is in circulation; however, this does not affect the treatment of most cases, where supportive care such as rehydration solutions are used. Antibiotics are only recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, the antibiotic which is being used for severe cases in Harare is Azithromycin which remains effective in the majority of cases. Contaminated water sources, including wells and boreholes are suspected as the source of the outbreak. #### Figure 1: Cholera cases in Harare, Zimbabwe from 4 September through 3 October 2018 #### Figure 2: Cholera cases in Zimbabwe from 4 September through 1 October 2018 ### Public health response * On 3 October 2018, an oral cholera vaccine mass vaccination campaign started in Harare City and surrounding areas such as Chitungwiza and Epworth. WHO is supporting the MoHCC on a strategy for rolling out the vaccination campaign, as well as implementing the campaign and sensitizing the public about the vaccine. More than 600 health workers have been trained to carry out the campaign. On 27 September 2018, 500 000 doses have arrived in Harare. In total, 2.7 million doses have been approved for two rounds of vaccination. * WHO and experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are providing technical oversight into case management and providing guidance on the interpretation of laboratory findings to guide the choice of antibiotics. * Four cholera treatment centres (CTCs) have been established. UNICEF has prepositioned seven tents at Glenview for the CTC and Oxfam is providing mobile toilets in three CTCs. * The key risk communication and community engagement interventions have been on raising awareness on cholera prevention through the mass media and social media, and working with specific community groups, including Apostolic sect leaders and Apostolic women’s groups. * Sixty volunteers have been deployed to provide risk communication, community engagement and social mobilization support to CTCs in Budiriro and Glen View. Health and hygiene promotion is taking place through drama shows at schools and business centres, roadshows and door-to-door visits, which also focuses on identification and case referral. * Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities include enforcement of regulations for food vendors, City of Harare fixing burst water pipes and increasing the water supply to hotspots, with private sector players supporting installation of water tanks and water trucking. * UNICEF is supporting distribution of non-food items (soap, buckets), along with Oxfam, Christian Care, Mercy Corps and Welthungerhilfe (WHH), as well as key components of community mobilization. * WHO has sent supplies to treat 3800 people and arrangements are in place for additional supplies to arrive in the coming days. In addition, more than 44 000 litres of ringers lactate from South Africa have arrived in country and the RDTs are being cleared from the airport. * Since the cholera outbreak was declared on 6 September 2018, weekly meetings of the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee on Health (IACCH) have been held. * On 12 September 2018, following the declaration of the cholera outbreak as a state of disaster, the Cabinet Committee on Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Management was reactivated. * On 18 September 2018, the national government set up an inter-ministerial committee on the cholera outbreak, involving all major government stakeholders, to provide leadership and to monitor the cholera response efforts and provide regular briefs to the President. * On 21 September 2018, the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated, with support provided by local business organizations. The Incident Command Structure (ICS) was finalized and will be published by the EOC. * On 1 October 2018, Econet began fixing Information and Communications Technology equipment in the EOC in MoHCC of Zimbabwe to support real time reporting. * On 29 September 2018, a rapid assessment of surveillance was conducted in coordination with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC). ### WHO risk assessment The outbreak started on 5 September and the number of cases notified per day continues to rapidly increase, particularly in Glen View and Budiriro suburbs of Harare. Cases with epidemiological links to this outbreak have been reported from other provinces across the country. Glen View, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, is an active informal trading area where people come from across the city and the rest of the country to trade. Key risk factors for cholera in Zimbabwe include the deterioration of sanitary and health infrastructure and increasing rural-urban migration which further strains the water and sanitation infrastructure. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 135 cases have been reported from provinces outside Harare. With the upcoming rainy season in November, there is a concern that cases may increase in the hotspots. In Harare, contaminated water from boreholes and wells is suspected to be the source of the outbreak. Sixty-nine percent of the population in Harare relies on these boreholes and wells as a source of water. The water supply situation in Harare remains dire due to the high demand of water that is not being met by the city supply though this is a focus of response efforts. The country’s available response capacities are overstretched as authorities are already responding to a large typhoid outbreak which started in August 2018. WHO assessed the overall public health risk to be high at the national level and moderate at the regional and low at global levels. ### WHO advice WHO recommends proper and timely case management in CTCs. Increasing access to potable water, improving sanitation infrastructure, and strengthening hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities are the most effective means to prevent and control cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to the affected population. WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Zimbabwe based on the information currently available in relation to this outbreak.

"(' On 31 May 2018, the State Ministry of Health (SMOH) of the Red Sea State in Sudan reported four suspected cases of chikungunya fever from Swakin locality, in Red Sea State. Among the signs and symptoms were sudden onset of fever, headache, joint pain and swelling, muscle pain and/or inability to walk. The first suspected case of chikungunya in the neighboring Kassala State was reported on 8 August 2018, in a male travelling from the Red Sea State. Since then cases have been reported in three localities of the State (Kassala, West Kassala and Rural Kassala). On 10 August, among 24 collected blood samples, 22 samples tested positive for chikungunya by PCR and ELISA at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) in Khartoum. On 9 September, an additional 100 samples were collected and pooled in batches of ten: 50% of pools tested positive for mixed chikungunya and dengue viruses, and all pools were positive for chikungunya virus. From 31 May through 2 October 2018, seven States (Kassala, Red Sea, Al Gadaref, River Nile, Northern State, South Darfur, and Khartoum) have been affected with a total of 13 978 cases of chikungunya, 95% of which are from Kassala State. No hospital admission or death has been officially reported. Approximately 7% of the reported cases were children less than 5 years of age and 60% were females. ### Public health response * Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) and the Health Cluster organized an ad-hoc Health Cluster Coordination meeting to engage health cluster partners in addressing the current outbreak. * FMOH in collaboration with WHO and partners prepared an accelerated response plan to scale up vector control and health education campaigns. * Volunteers were mobilized to conduct house-to-house visits, inspection and targeted health education campaigns. * WHO technically and financially supported the surveillance system and case management. * WHO and partners provided logistical and financial support to the response operation (case management, surveillance, vector control, health education and risk communication) in affected localities in Kassala, Gadaref and Red Sea States. * WHO mobilized funds to support the scaled up operations by the FMOH including deployment of various staff at both the Federal and State level. ### WHO risk assessment The overall risk of chikungunya at the national level is very high because of the following: presence of Aedes aegypti in most parts of the country, availability of breeding sites in houses and uncoordinated community involvement in vector control aggravated by the ongoing rainy season which favours the proliferation of the vector and spread of the outbreak to other states in the country. Also, in the absence of a good surveillance system to clearly define the dynamics of the outbreak, it is a big challenge to target the public health actions to control the outbreak. The lack of financial and technical resources to respond to needs, if not addressed immediately and properly, may lead to further escalation of the number of cases and eventually overwhelm the already over-stretched capacities of the country. The risk at the regional level is considered moderate. WHO Regional Office is already mobilizing its resources to support the ongoing outbreak and is prepared to support other neighbouring countries if the outbreak spreads outside Sudan. The overall risk at the global level is low. ### WHO advice Prevention and control of chikungunya relies heavily on reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected communities. During outbreaks, insecticides may be sprayed to kill mosquitoes, applied to surfaces in and around containers where the mosquitoes land, and used to treat water in containers to kill the immature larvae. For protection during outbreaks of chikungunya, clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting vectors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. For those who sleep during the daytime, insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection. Basic precautions should be taken by people travelling to risk areas and these include use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.

"(' From July through September 2018, six cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 case in Jigawa and Katsina States, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from 18 July through 16 September 2018. This outbreak has also affected Jigawa, Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, and Borno states in Nigeria, with 17 cases reported since April 2018. Nigeria has also reported a separate cVDPV2 outbreak in Sokoto State that dates back to January 2018. Nigeria is one of only three countries in the world classified as endemic for wild poliovirus, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan. As part of the polio outbreak response in the Lake Chad Basin countries (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria) the last monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) round was implemented in Niger in January 2017. ### Public health response The outbreak response plan is being finalized to include the outbreak zone most at risk and the exact scale and extent of the response is being determined. * Two mOPV2 response vaccination campaigns will reach 3.2 million children under five years of age in four provinces in Niger (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi and Zinder). The first round took place from 24 through 27 October 2018 and the second is scheduled for 7 through 11 November 2018. * Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced. * WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. * Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded. * WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement. * WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health are working together to finalize the deployment of the human resources needed at national and provincial levels. ### WHO risk assessment The emergence of cVDPV2 in Niger is a reminder that until polio is eradicated, polio-free countries will remain at risk of polio re-infection or re- emergence. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. As this outbreak is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria, the risk of further international spread associated with this virus remains high. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement prevention measures, and speed-up the response if needed. Countries should also maintain high polio immunization coverage through routine vaccination to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction or emergence. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel. For travellers to Niger, IPV is recommended as it is effective against cVDPV2, whereas the type 2 component is no longer included in OPV. All countries should report any polio case using the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Countries affected by polio transmission should comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director General following advice from the IHR Emergency Committee concerning ongoing events and context involving transmission and international spread of poliovirus. These recommendations include that affected countries declare a national public health emergency, and encourage departing travellers to be vaccinated. ',)",6
"(' On 22 November 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed by Dutch authorities of a laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever. The case-patient is a 26 year-old male who visited Gambia from 3 through 17 November 2018, with a three day trip to Senegal from 12 through 14 November. He had no history of vaccination for yellow fever prior to the trip. On 18 November 2018, the case- patient developed symptoms including fever, nausea and vomiting. On19 November 2018 he was hospitalized with symptoms of acute liver failure and he is still in hospital as of 10 December. The International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) from the Netherlands has notified counterparts in Gambia and Senegal about the case, and about the exact locations visited by the patient. There have been no other reports of confirmed yellow fever cases from Senegal, Gambia or The Netherlands at this time. ### WHO risk assessment Yellow fever is an acute viral illness that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause a serious public health impact in an unimmunized population. Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing the infection. The importation of a case of yellow fever from Gambia or Senegal to the Netherlands represents international disease spread. However, sporadic imported cases of yellow fever from endemic countries in unvaccinated travellers are not unexpected. The risk of further local transmission of yellow fever virus related to this case in the Netherlands or further within the WHO European Region is currently considered to be negligible, as no competent vector for yellow fever has been established in the Netherlands . Both Senegal and Gambia have sustained high levels of population immunity against yellow fever, which should prevent major amplification of disease transmission in humans locally. However, the high coverage in the endemic population will not offer protection to unimmunized individuals in high risk areas because yellow fever can be spread from the infected non-human primate reservoir to unimmunized persons through mosquito bites (vector-borne transmission). Therefore, travel to endemic areas remains a significant risk for unvaccinated individuals. ### WHO advice Advice to travellers planning to visit, or reside in, areas at risk for yellow fever transmission include: * Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel for all travellers aged nine months or older. Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. * Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites. * Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever. * Promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e., where the competent vector is present). This case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with favorable environments for yellow fever transmission, such as Gambia and Senegal. WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to seek rapidly medical advice upon noticing their onset. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present. WHO advises against the application of any restrictions on travel or trade to the countries associated with this case based on the information available for this event.

"(' Pakistan Health Authorities have reported an ongoing outbreak of extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid fever that began in the Hyderabad district of Sindh province in November 2016. An increasing trend of typhoid fever cases caused by antimicrobial resistant (AMR) strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (or S. Typhi) poses a notable public health concern. In May 2018, the case definitions for non-resistant, multi-drug resistant (MDR) and XDR typhoid fever were formally agreed by the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU) in Karachi, following a review by an expert group of epidemiologists, clinicians and microbiologists from Pakistan. All typhoid fever cases reported from 2016 to 2018 were reviewed and classified according to these case definitions (see Table 1). #### Table 1. Classification of Typhoid Fever Cases by Drug Resistance Status, Pakistan, 2018 From 1 November 2016 through 9 December 2018, 5 274 cases of XDR typhoid out of 8 188 typhoid fever cases were reported by the Provincial Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (PDSRU) in Sindh province, Pakistan. Sixty-nine percent of cases were reported in Karachi (the capital city), 27% in Hyderabad district, and 4% in other districts in the province (Table 2). The circulating XDR strain of S. Typhi haplotype 58 was resistant to first and second-line antibiotics as well as third generation cephalosporins. Informal reports of XDR typhoid cases occurring in other parts of Pakistan were made and required further verification. #### Table 2. Distribution of reported XDR typhoid fever cases in Sindh Province, Pakistan [1 November 2016 through 9 December 2018] In addition, from January to October 2018, there were reports indicating international transmission of the XDR typhoid strain through persons who had travelled to Pakistan. Six travel-associated cases of XDR typhoid were reported; one in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and five in the United States of America. Four of the travel-associated cases had visited or resided in Karachi (Sindh province), Lahore (Punjab province) and/or Islamabad in Pakistan. Details regarding these four cases are as follows: * Two of the cases travelled to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. * One case travelled only to Karachi. * One case pending confirmation, is a resident from Lahore with travel history to the US where he/she was diagnosed and treated. The case has since returned to Pakistan. Limited information is available about their mechanism of exposure or the exact date of onset of illness for these cases but, there are evidence that all the travel-associated cases were successfully treated. ### Public health response In January 2017, the Government of Pakistan initiated a public health response to the increasing number of XDR typhoid fever cases in Sindh province. The resulting activities included: * Community and school awareness campaigns on safe hygiene and sanitation practices were carried out in Hyderabad, including specific health education on hand hygiene, use of safe drinking water, and environmental sanitation. * Water purification and sanitation activities were implemented, including distribution of chlorine tablets to affected communities in Hyderabad. * General practitioners and clinicians in Hyderabad were sensitized on the rational use of antimicrobials for typhoid fever by the Department of Health and partners, with support from the WHO. * A typhoid vaccination campaign was commenced on 5 August 2017 in Hyderabad with Vi-polysaccharide typhoid vaccine (ViPS). Approximately 6000 children aged 6 months to 10 years, were vaccinated. A subsequent mass vaccination campaign with typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) was launched in Hyderabad in January 2018, resulting in approximately 118 000 children, aged 6 months to 10 years being vaccinated to date. The government of Pakistan also applied for GAVI support for a three-year phased TCV introduction into the routine National Program on Immunization, starting from 2019. Prior to the introduction, phased catch-up campaigns in urban areas will be conducted. The target age group for this activity is children aged 9 months to 15 years. * XDR National Taskforce was established in July 2018, and a joint WHO and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) mission was founded. Recommendations these collaborations are currently being translated into a draft national action plan in Pakistan. * Updated surveillance tools and a line listing template for data collection on typhoid cases were shared with all the provincial departments of health on 7 September 2018. The purpose of this was to collect additional information and enhance surveillance, particularly about the occurrence and spread of XDR typhoid to other parts of Pakistan, and beyond. WHO has been leading initiatives to make a sustained difference in the continuing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These initiatives include: * The Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS): A standardized approach to the collection, analysis and sharing of data related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including reports of emerging resistance via GLASS-EAR (Emerging Antimicrobial Resistance). The purpose of this activity was to inform decision-making and drive local, national and regional action. * WHO supported the XDR National Task Force in Pakistan, chaired by the Director-General of Health, in the development of the National Action Plan on AMR1. * Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP): A joint initiative of WHO and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) which encourages public-private research partnerships, including on typhoid fever. ### WHO risk assessment The risk of XDR S. Typhi at the national level is considered high in Pakistan due to insufficient water, poor sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, low vaccination coverage and limited surveillance for typhoid fever. The fact that AMR S. Typhi confirmatory testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is only conducted by major laboratories and tertiary care hospitals are other priority considerations in terms of risk. These factors, coupled with sub- optimal antibiotic prescribing practices, have limited the ability to track the occurrence, spread, and containment of XDR S. Typhi. Outbreaks of MDR typhoid and sporadic cases of infection with ceftriaxone- resistant S. Typhi have been reported in several countries. However, this is the first time a large outbreak caused by XDR S. Typhi has been observed in Pakistan. The risk at regional level is considered moderate due to the similar environments and approaches to treatment of typhoid fever, as well as the widespread over-use of anti-microbials which is compounded by considerable levels of migration within the region. Globally, the risk is considered low due to the availability of antimicrobials and rational prescribing practices. However, S. Typhi has a global distribution and the potential for travelers to spread this resistant clone, especially in countries with poor WASH infrastructure, cannot be eliminated. The high level of resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics in the H58 clonal strain identified to be circulating in parts of Pakistan increases the potential risk at all three levels. ### WHO recommendations This outbreak highlights the importance of public health measures to prevent the spread of resistant and non-resistant pathogens. While the emerging resistance in S. Typhi complicates treatment, typhoid fever remains common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers, and typhoid vaccination are the main and most important recommendations. WHO recommends typhoid vaccination in response to confirmed outbreaks of typhoid fever, and travelers to typhoid-endemic areas should consider vaccination. Further, where the TCV is licensed, WHO recommends TCV as the preferred typhoid vaccine. Typhoid vaccination should be implemented in combination with other efforts to control the disease. In view of the observed capacity for S. Typhi to quickly acquire new resistance mechanisms, WHO recommends strengthening surveillance of typhoid fever, including surveillance of AMR to monitor known resistance, detect new and emerging resistance, and mitigate its spread. WHO also recommends that surveillance data is shared locally and internationally in a timely manner. Currently, azithromycin is the only remaining reliable and affordable first- line oral therapeutic option to manage patients with XDR typhoid in low- resource settings. Patients with suspected typhoid fever should be tested microbiologically to detect S. Typhi and define antimicrobial susceptibility wherever possible to inform patient management and contribute to the surveillance efforts. Verification and advanced testing (including molecular methods) of S. Typhi strains with unusual resistance should be performed by designated expert laboratories that provide confirmatory testing, where such capacity exists within countries. In countries where no laboratory capacity currently exists, regional collaboration may be an option, whereby a neighbouring country’s reference laboratory or a WHO Collaborating Center can fulfill this role. ### For more information: 1 Chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 2 Cefixime is recommended by the International Academy of the Philippines (IAP) for uncomplicated typhoid fever.

"(' The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While communities in affected areas are generally supportive of the Ebola response, operations in some areas have been temporarily disrupted due to insecurity. On 27 December 2018, protests at government buildings in Beni spilled over to an Ebola transit centre, frightening people waiting for Ebola test results and the staff who were caring for them. Staff at the centre temporarily withdrew and most suspected cases were transferred to a nearby treatment centre. WHO is concerned about the negative effects that the current insecurity is having on efforts to control the outbreak. After an intensification of field activities, marked improvements in controlling the outbreak were observed in many areas, including a recent decrease in cases in Beni. These gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity that results in increased Ebola virus transmission. While maintaining focus on ending the outbreak and resuming normal operations as soon as possible, all response partners remain committed to ensuring the safety of staff. WHO continues to monitor the situation closely and will adapt their response as needed. As of 26 December 2018, a total of 591 EVD cases, including 543 confirmed and 48 probable cases, have been reported from 16 health zones in the two neighbouring provinces of North Kivu and Ituri (Figure 1). Of these cases, 54 were healthcare workers, of which 18 died. Overall, 357 cases have died (case fatality ratio 60%). In the past week, ten additional patients were discharged from Ebola treatment centres; overall, 203 patients have recovered to date. The highest number of cases were from age group 15‒49 years with 60% (355/589) of the cases, and of those, 228 were female. Highest attack rates have been observed in children aged more than one year (especially male infants) and females aged 15 years and older. Trends in case incidence (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas. The general decrease in the weekly incidence observed in Beni since late October continued; however, the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, and new clusters have emerged in other health zones. Thirteen health zones reported a total of 109 confirmed cases in the last 21 days (5‒26 December 2018). The majority of which were concentrated in major urban centres and towns in Katwa (26), Komanda (21), Mabalako (15), Beni (14) and Butembo (10) health zones. An isolated case was also recently detected in Nyankunde Health Zone – a newly affected area in Ituri Province – whom likely acquired the infection in Komanda. This case, highlights the continued high risk of continued spread of the outbreak and the need to strengthen all aspects of the response in Ituri, North Kivu and surrounding provinces and countries. The MoH, WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside of the abovementioned outbreak affected areas. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 26 December 2018 (n=591) #### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 26 December 2018 (n=591)* *Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning – trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously. ### Public health response The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross- border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened. For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: ### WHO risk assessment This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information. As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond. ### WHO advice International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene. For more information, see: * * * 1The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results. ',)",591
"("" WHO is supporting the Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar to respond to an unusually large measles outbreak. Madagascar last experienced measles outbreaks in 2003 and 2004, with reported number of cases at 62 233 and 35 558, respectively. Since then, the number of reported cases had sharply declined until the current outbreak. From 4 October 2018 to 7 January 2019, 19 539 measles cases and 39 “facility-based” deaths (case fatality ratio: 0.2%) have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) of Madagascar. Cases were reported from 66 of 114 total districts in all 22 regions of Madagascar. Among the 19 539 measles cases, 375 have been laboratory confirmed (all are IgM+) and 19 164 were confirmed by epidemiological link. Cases confirmed by epidemiological link are those who presented clinical symptoms based on the case definition and had been in contact with another laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked case. The outbreak has spread to densely populated urban cities including Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsirabe, Toliara and the capital city Antananarivo. Most cases were reported from Analamanga (61%) and Boeny (20%) regions. The highest attack rates were observed in Antananarivo- Renivohitra district (714 per 100 000 inhabitants), and Ambato-Boina district (668 per 100 000 inhabitants), in Analamanga and Mahajanga regions, respectively. These rates are considerably higher compared to the national attack rate of 108 per 100 000 inhabitants. In the current epidemic, children aged 1 to 14 years account for 64% of the total number of cases. The age distribution in this group is as follows: under five years at 35%, 5-9 years at 22% and 10-14 years at 19%. Both sexes are equally affected with a male to female ratio of 1.04. The national immunization programme recommends routine measles immunization for children aged nine months. According to WHO and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the estimated measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. More than half of the cases (51%) reported during the current outbreak have not been vaccinated or have unknown immunization status. Madagascar has the highest proportion of malnutrition among children under five (47%) in the African region which can increase children's risk of serious complications and death from measles infection. The circulating genotype for the current measles outbreak in Madagascar is B3, usually found in Africa and Europe. No measles cases with travel history to Madagascar, however, have been reported in neighboring countries and initial investigations in Madagascar have not shown any link with cases from countries with measles outbreak in the Africa region or Europe. The measles outbreak has occurred concurrently with the resurgence of plague in the country—which reoccurs seasonally—straining the public health response. ### Public health response The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public Health response measures include: * Enhancement of active surveillance (active case finding, community-based surveillance, distribution of specimen collection kits) in all affected districts. * Use of the Global Measles Programmatic Risk Assessment Tool to target priority districts for vaccination. * Completion of targeted vaccination campaigns: * Campaign conducted from 22 October to 9 November 2018 in four districts of Antanavarivo city. The campaign targeted at least 95% of children aged between nine and 59 months. Preliminary results show coverage of 84% of the targeted population. * Campaign planned from 14 to 18 January targeting 2 083 734 children aged between nine months and nine years in 25 districts across 13 regions. The campaign is being funded by Measles Rubella Initiative (MRI), the Government of Madagascar, WHO, UNICEF, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Commission de l'Océan Indien (COI), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Embassy of France in Madagascar and the World Bank and the total cost is US$ 2 355 989. * Reinforcement of routine immunization (one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) as per the national immunization programme) for children aged between nine and 11 months. * Continued management of severe measles cases in referral hospitals, provided to patients free of charge. Vitamin A is being administered to patients under care in all referral and district health centres. * Continued community mobilization with the support of UNICEF and USAID, aiming to increase understanding of the disease as well as uptake of the vaccines from campaigns and routine vaccination. * Reactivation by USAID of the 910 hotline, formerly used during the 2017 plague epidemic, for information sharing on measles. ### WHO risk assessment Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease that has potential to lead to major epidemics. Low coverage with measles vaccine combined with a low incidence of measles in recent years in Madagascar has contributed to a significant proportion of the population which is susceptible to measles. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, the measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. The malnutrition rate is also a contributor as malnutrition increases children's vulnerability of serious complications and death from measles infection. WHO estimates the overall risk for Madagascar from this measles outbreak to be very high. Currently, several concomitant factors are likely to hinder or delay public health intervention and might jeopardize the response: post- election conflict, geographical isolation and remoteness of cases, insecurity, hurricane season and multiple outbreaks. Targeted immunization campaigns and strengthening of routine immunization activities are paramount in the effective control of the outbreak. Administration of Vitamin A, specifically in a context of high rates of malnutrition, can reduce illness and deaths from measles infection. The risk at the regional level is low although the spread of measles to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other African countries and Europe cannot be excluded. Strengthening of surveillance in neighboring countries is recommended. The overall global risk is considered to be low. ### WHO advice WHO urges all Member States to: * Vaccinate to maintain coverage of 95% with two doses of MCV. * Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.), and international travelers. * Maintain a reserve of MCV and syringes for control of imported cases in each country in the region. * Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of fever or rash cases for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within five days of being taken. * Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the establishment or reestablishment of endemic transmission. * Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (50,000 IU for a child less than 6 months of age, 100,000 IU for children 6-12 months of age or 200,000 IU for children 12-59 months); two doses, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day). WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and or trade to Madagascar based on the information available on the current outbreak.

"("" On 19 December 2018, the Argentinian Ministry of Health and Social Development issued an epidemiological alert regarding an increase in cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Epuyén, Chubut Province. Between 28 October 2018 – 20 January of 2019, a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS, including 11 deaths have been reported in Epuyén, Chubut Province. Epuyén has a population of approximately 2 000 persons, and Chubut Province is located in Patagonia in southern Argentina. The index case had environmental exposure prior to symptom onset on 2 November, and subsequently attended a party on 3 November. Six cases who also attended the party experienced the onset of symptoms between 20-27 November 2018. An additional 17 cases, all of whom were epidemiologically-linked to previously confirmed cases, experienced symptom onset between 7 December 2018 and 3 January 2019 (Figure 1). Potential human-to-human transmission is currently under investigation. Of the confirmed cases, 59% were female, and had an incubation period ranging from 8 to 31 days. Approximately 50% of these confirmed cases reported symptoms within the past three weeks. Cases were confirmed by ELISA IgM u-captura or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As of 17 January 2019, a total of 98 asymptomatic contacts have been identified and are being monitored for the potential development of symptoms. In Argentina, four endemic regions have been identified: North (Salta, Jujuy), Centro (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Ríos), Northeast (Misiones) and Sur (Neuquén, Río Negro, and Chubut). Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 100 confirmed cases were registered annually, with the provinces of Buenos Aires, Salta, and Jujuy having the highest numbers of cases. Between 2013 and 2018, 114 confirmed deaths from hantavirus were reported in Argentina, with a case- fatality rate of 18.6%, though this figure was close to 40% for some provinces in the southern region of the country. In Chile, one of the confirmed cases was a healthcare worker who resides in Palena Province, Los Lagos Region, and reported experiencing symptoms on 2 January 2019. The case had a travel history to Epuyén for one day in mid- November, and later hosted and cared for a confirmed case from Epuyén while she was in her prodromal phase. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in Los Lagos Region in 2019. During 2018, there were eight cases of hantavirus reported in Chile, including two deaths. #### Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of HPS by week of symptom onset in Epuyén, Chubut Province, Argentina. Source: Published by the Ministry of Health of Chubut Province and reproduced by PAHO/WHO ### Public health response Health authorities in Argentina and Chile are implementing the following public health measures: * Enhanced surveillance and active case finding including increase local diagnostic capacities for hantavirus for early diagnosis * Daily follow-up of contacts * Deployments of multi-disciplinary teams to the affected areas for outbreak investigation * Environmental control measures * Conduct risk communication activities; including educational awareness and health promotion in the communities and in healthcare facilities * Implementation of infection prevention and control measures * Safe case management of HPS patient in dedicated health care facilities ### WHO risk assessment HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic rodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to the virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one week and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can reach 35-50%. In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents, mainly Sigmodontinae species, transmission can occur when people come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human transmission of HPS due to Andes virus in Argentina has been previously documented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient isolation. Standard precautions1 should always be put in place, as well as rodent control measures. ### WHO advice PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus. Particular attention should be paid towards travelers returning from the affected areas. Early identification and timely medical care greatly improves clinical outcomes. To raise awareness regarding potential HPS cases, clinicians should consult epidemiological data for guidance of the possible exposure, and be vigilant of patients presenting with suspicious clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. Care during the initial stages of the disease should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad- spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICU). Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, is not approved for either treatment or prophylaxis of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infection. Health awareness campaigns must aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people’s exposure. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. Most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposure of travelers to rodents or their excreta. However, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking, should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials. HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. The implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations, is recommended. References: * * * 1 Standard precautions refer to a set of practices that are applied to the care of patients, regardless of the state of infection (suspicion or confirmation), in any place where health services are provided. These practices aim to protect both healthcare professionals and patients and include: hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, safe handling of sharps materials, safe injection practices, use of sterile instruments and equipment and cleaning of hospital environments and the environment.

The first one, was from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case with onset of paralysis on 21 October 2018, a six-year old girl with no history of vaccination, and the second isolate was from a community contact of the first case, a child aged one-year old. ### Public health response WHO and partners at the regional and country level are assisting the Ministry of Health and local public health authorities to conduct a thorough field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological), to assess the extent and original source of circulation of this virus more clearly, and to further plan and support the implementation of an outbreak response as appropriate, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. While national routine oral polio vaccine type 3 (OPV3) immunization coverage in 2017 was estimated at 80%, population immunity gaps remain at subnational levels, especially in Zambézia province (with 60% OPV3 coverage). ### WHO risk assessment WHO assessed the overall public health risk at the national level to be high due to a decline in population immunity to type 2 poliovirus and the risk of international spread to be medium due to ongoing population movements. The detection of cVDPV2 underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation and underscores the risk posed by any medium to low- level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniform high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that before travelling to areas with active poliovirus transmission, travellers from polio-free countries should ensure that they have completed the age-appropriate polio vaccination series, according to their respective national immunization schedule. Travellers to polio-infected areas who completed an OPV or IPV vaccine series more than 12 months previously should be given another one-time booster dose of polio vaccine. Before travelling abroad, persons of all ages residing in polio-infected countries (i.e. those with active transmission of a wild or vaccine derived poliovirus) and long-term visitors to such countries (i.e. persons who spend more than four weeks in the country) should have completed a full course of vaccination against polio in compliance with the national schedule. Travellers from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel to boost intestinal mucosal immunity and reduce the risk of poliovirus shedding, which could lead to reintroduction of poliovirus into a polio free area. For persons who previously received only IPV, OPV should be the choice for the booster dose, if available and feasible. In case of unavoidable last-minute travel, travellers who have not received a documented dose of polio vaccine within the previous 12 months should still receive one dose of OPV or IPV before departure. Updates on currently or recently infected countries can be found on the website of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication such as adequate vaccination of international travellers; intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data and intensify cross border efforts. In addition, the Committee emphasized that states infected with cVDPV2 should encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel. States should ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status. The Committee also noted the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections and recommended that States should consider requesting vaccines from the global monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2. The full statement of the Emergency Committee Polio is available from the WHO web site. ',)",2
"(' On 3 January 2019, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Jamaica notified WHO of an increase in dengue cases in Jamaica. From 1 January though 21 January 2019, 339 suspected and confirmed cases including six deaths were reported (Figure 1). In 2018, a total of 986 suspected and confirmed cases of dengue including 13 deaths have been reported. The number of reported dengue cases in 2018 was 4.5 times higher than that reported in 2017 (215 cases including six deaths). Cases reported to date for 2019 exceed the epidemic threshold (Figure 2). According to historic data, Jamaica reported a major outbreak in 2016, when 2297 cases of dengue infection including two deaths were reported. Dengue virus 3 (DENV3) and DENV4 circulations were confirmed at the time. By the end of 2018, the largest number of reported cases were notified by Kingston and Saint Andrew parishes. In 2019 so far, the largest proportion of cases have been reported by Saint Catherine parish. Laboratory tests have identified DENV3 as the dengue serotype currently circulating. In January 2019, some countries and territories in the Caribbean region, such as Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint Martin, reported an increase in dengue cases. Of note, in Saint Martin and Guadeloupe, serotype DENV1 is currently circulating. #### Figure 1. Dengue fever cases and deaths by week of onset from 1 January 2018 through 21 January 2019 in Jamaica* Source: Jamaica Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO *Cumulative suspected/ presumed/ confirmed cases = 1325 #### Figure 2. Suspected, presumed and confirmed dengue cases by month for 2018 and 2019 versus monthly averages and epidemic threshold for Jamaica Source: Jamaica Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO ### Public health response * The Ministry of Health (MoH) declared the dengue outbreak on 3 January 2019. * Health authorities in Jamaica are implementing measures for the following activities; strengthened integrated vector control, enhanced surveillance of cases, social mobilization, clinical management, enhanced laboratory diagnostic capacity, and emergency risk communications. * The MoH has been collaborating with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and other international agencies to strengthen and co-ordinate the response activities. * Since July 2018, the MoH has intensified its vector control activities. * The MoH launched the Emergency Operations Centre on 27 December 2018; and fully activated it on 3 January 2019 to facilitate the coordination and reporting of activities. The response activities are geared towards strengthening the response capacity with adequate human resources, as well as supporting efforts to reduce the entomological indices for the Aedes aegypti mosquito across the island and enhancing clinical management capacity. ### WHO risk assessment Jamaica has been reporting dengue cases since 1990 and throughout 2018; however, an increase has been observed since December 2018 exceeding the epidemic threshold. Similar large increases were reported in 2010 (2887 cases), 2012 (4670 cases), and 2016 (2297 cases). The increase of dengue in the Caribbean islands may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and require comprehensive risk communication. ### WHO advice On 21 November 2018, PAHO/WHO alerted Member States about an increase in dengue cases in countries and territories in the Americas and recommended coordinated actions both inside and outside of the health sector, including prioritizing activities to prevent transmission of dengue as well as deaths due to this disease. PAHO/WHO further advises to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue, available at the link below. There is no specific treatment for disease due to dengue; therefore, prevention is the most important step to reduce the risk of dengue infection. WHO recommends proper and timely case management of dengue cases. Surveillance should continue to be strengthened within all affected areas and at the national level. Key public health communication messages should continue to be provided to reduce the risk of transmission of dengue in the population. In addition, integrated vector management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposures. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. Where indoor biting occurs, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce biting activity. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce biting. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, personal protective measures such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight hours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing. The use of repellents must be in strict accordance with label instructions. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection for those who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, the bedridden, and night-shift workers) as well as during the night to prevent mosquito bites. WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied based on the information available for this event. ',)",1325
"(' From 1 January through 10 February 2019, 327 cases of Lassa fever (324 confirmed cases and three probable cases) with 72 deaths (case fatality ratio = 22%) have been reported across 20 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with the majority of cases being reported from Edo (108) and Ondo (103) states. Twelve cases have been reported among healthcare workers in seven states – Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu. The number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 February 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio = 27%) were reported from nine states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019 represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1). Of the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. Sixty contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive. Ninety-one case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care. #### Figure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 January through 10 February 2019 Source: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) ### Public health response * On 22 January 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency. * Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities. * Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC. * Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country. * Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 through 17 January 2019. ### WHO risk assessment Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. Although Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly. With twelve confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures. ### WHO advice Prevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information. For more information on Lassa fever, please see the link below: ',)",327
"(' On 12 February, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) has been confirmed in Papua province, Indonesia. Two genetically-linked VDPV1 viruses were isolated from a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) with onset of paralysis on 27 November 2018 and in a healthy community contact, a child whose stool sample was collected on 24 January 2019. The location of this healthy child, with the VDPV isolation, is in a remote village, approximately 3–4 km away from the AFP case with onset of paralysis on 27 November 2018. Even though this province shares a border with Papua New Guinea, this outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 outbreak currently affecting its neighbouring country. ### Public health response WHO and partners are supporting the Ministry of Health (MoH) and local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation, a thorough risk assessment and planning an outbreak response. The exact extent and timing of the outbreak response is being finalized. Initial outbreak response immunization (ORI) has been conducted in Yahukimo district and 5718 children under 15 years of age have been immunized with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). Disease surveillance, including conducting retrospective and active searches for additional acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, has been further strengthened in community health centres, hospitals and other health facilities including all districts and cities in Papua province. Surveillance has also been strengthened at entry and exit ports and monitoring notification and reporting through the Early Warning, Alert, and Response System (EWARS) has been reinforced. Other provinces have been alerted to improve immunization and AFP surveillance. The most recent National Immunisation Day (NID) conducted in Indonesia was in March 2016 using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) (in advance of the trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV switch), and Papua province conducted a bivalent OPV/measles/rubella Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) in late 2018. In addition, in response to the recent cVDPV1 outbreak in Papua New Guinea, MoH Indonesia had already established border vaccination posts and initiated environmental surveillance in Papua province. They had also conducted a simulation exercise to test their polio outbreak response plan. However, the polio vaccination coverage in Papua province remains low (2016 SIA coverage: 77% and 2018 SIA coverage: 72%; overall OPV4 coverage: 68.2% in 2017 and 40.8% in 2018). ### WHO risk assessment The detection of cVDPVs underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any polioviruses. These events also underscore the risk posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented. The overall risk is assessed as moderate at the national level due to the sub- optimal polio vaccination coverage and surveillance quality in Papua province of Indonesia. The population density in the highlands, from where the virus has been isolated, is relatively low and population movement from that area to other provinces not significant. Locally in Papua province, there is limited capacity within existing resources for implementing response measures. At the regional level despite proximity with Papua New Guinea the overall risk is assessed to be low as there is limited cross border population movement from the affected area; however, virological analysis indicates that the virus may have been possibly circulating for a few years with immunization coverage being low in neighbouring areas. Jayapura, a nearby district that has high international population movement has not had any persons test positive for cVDPV. At the global level, the overall risk is assessed as low due to generally high polio vaccine coverage, established AFP surveillance systems and availability of technical expertise for polio control. This risk will be continuously assessed and could be reviewed according to the evolution of the situation. ### WHO advice Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPVs) are rare but well documented strains of poliovirus that can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. The emergence of VDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection. It is important that all countries, in particular those with persons who frequently travel and have contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health (http://www.who.int/ith/en/) recommends that before travelling to areas with active poliovirus transmission (i.e. those with active transmission of a wild or vaccine derived poliovirus), travellers from polio-free countries should ensure that they have completed the age-appropriate polio vaccination series, according to their respective national immunization schedule. In addition, they should be given another one- time booster dose of polio vaccine if the OPV or IPV vaccine series were completed more than 12 months previously. Before travelling abroad, persons of all ages residing in polio-infected countries and long-term visitors to such countries (i.e. persons who spend more than four weeks in the country) should have completed a full course of vaccination against polio in compliance with the national schedule. In addition, they should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel to boost intestinal mucosal immunity and reduce the risk of poliovirus shedding, which could lead to reintroduction of poliovirus into a polio-free area. For persons who previously received only IPV, OPV should be the choice for the booster dose, if available and feasible. In case of unavoidable last-minute travel, travellers who have not received a documented dose of polio vaccine within the previous 12 months, should still receive one dose of OPV or IPV before departure. Updates on currently or recently infected countries can be found on the website of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication such as adequate vaccination of international travellers; intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data and intensify cross border efforts. State should ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.

"(' On 12 February 2019, the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) received a report regarding surgical site infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa after invasive procedures performed in Tijuana, Mexico. As of 11 February, a total of 20 cases, 16 confirmed and 4 suspected, have been identified in nine states in the United States. As per the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) case definition, a confirmed case is defined as Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase–producing carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (VIM-CRPA) isolated from a patient who had an invasive procedure in Mexico in the month prior to collection of the VIM-CRPA positive specimen. A suspect case is CRPA unavailable for mechanism testing or pending mechanism testing from a patient who had an invasive procedure in Mexico in the month prior to collection of the specimen. Of the 20 total cases, two were reported retrospectively and had dates of specimen collection in 2015 and 2017, while the remaining 18 cases had dates of specimen collection between 5 September 2018 and 24 January 2019. All cases were in travelers who received medical care from healthcare facilities in Tijuana, Mexico. Fifteen of the total cases reported having surgery, primarily for weight loss, at Grand View Hospital. Half of the total cases reported the use of the same medical tourism travel agency based in the United States to coordinate their surgical procedure in Mexico. Although most referred patients were from the United States and Canada, this medical tourism travel agency has reportedly referred patients from additional countries to Grand View Hospital since 1 August 2018. A total of 13 cases have been hospitalized in the United States for complications associated with VIM-CRPA infection following invasive procedures in Mexico; most presented with a surgical site infection. One patient with a bloodstream infection and several underlying comorbidities died. Of the 17 cases with available information on sex and age, 14 (82%) were female, and ages ranged from 29 to 62 years. A local investigation at Grand View Hospital identified reusable equipment that was not being appropriately processed, which poses a small but potential risk of transmission for bloodborne infections among patients. On 9 January 2019, the US-CDC issued a Travel Notice regarding cases of resistant P. aeruginosa infection linked to surgery at Grand View Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, with a recommendation that US residents not undergo surgery (bariatric or other type) at Grand View Hospital until it is confirmed that VIM-CRPA is no longer spreading at the facility. On 22 January 2019, the US- CDC issued a notification recommending that individuals who had surgery at Grand View Hospital on or after 1 August 2018 talk to their healthcare provider about getting tested for the following bloodborne pathogens: hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). On 13 February 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) also issued a Public Health Notice regarding Canadian travelers who may have been exposed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria after having undergone surgical procedures in Tijuana, Mexico. In addition, Canadian travelers who had procedures at Grand View Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, may also be at-risk for bloodborne infections such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Given the possibility of exposure to these health risks, PHAC recommends that patients who have had surgery at Grand View Hospital or other medical facilities in Tijuana, and who are experiencing signs of an infection—such as fever, redness, pus or swelling at the surgical incision site—see a healthcare provider immediately. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their travel to Mexico and all medical care or surgeries they had while they were outside of Canada. ### WHO risk assessment Individuals in the United States with resistant P. aeruginosa infections following invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy) in Mexico have reported undergoing procedures at different healthcare facilities in Tijuana. One facility, Grand View Hospital, is associated with an ongoing outbreak of VIM-producing P. aeruginosa infections. Persons who underwent procedures at this healthcare facility may be infected or at-risk of developing VIM- producing P. aeruginosa infections. There is a risk of spreading resistant P. aeruginosa by patients returning to their home countries, particularly in healthcare settings. A single medical tourism travel agency based in the United States reported referring individuals from different countries to Grand View Hospital since 1 August 2018; however, persons from additional countries may also be affected. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO encourages sharing this outbreak information with relevant public health authorities and clinicians, to enable timely recognition of potential cases that could be related to this outbreak. WHO recommends implementing infection prevention and control measures, as described in the “Guidelines for the prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in health care facilities”, to prevent the dissemination of multi-drug resistant microorganisms in healthcare settings, available at the link below. As antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, including in the Region of the Americas, WHO encourages States Parties to increase efforts for early detection of resistant microorganisms and to implement prevention and control actions for containing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Surveillance is a key component of prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and should be strengthened, along with laboratory capacity, to support the detection of infection caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria and to inform infection prevention and control practices and antimicrobial stewardship. Treatment policies should be based on both antibiotic susceptibility testing when possible and on the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance when empiric treatment is prescribed. Clinicians must be updated on treatment recommendations as these evolve due to very dynamic changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns. WHO recommends against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Mexico based on the information available for this event. ### For more information: ',)",20
"(' The rise in number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases observed in the North Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this week. During the last 21 days (20 March to 9 April 2019), 57 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 40% of the 141 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 207 probable and confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (83), Vuhovi (41), Mandima (29), Beni (21), Butembo (15), Oicha (8), Masereka (4), Lubero (2), Musienene (2), Kalunguta (1), and Mabalako (1). As of 9 April, a total of 1186 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 751 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1186 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (675) were female, and 29% (341) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 87 (7% of total cases), including 31 deaths. To date, a total of 354 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened the Emergency Committee for a meeting on 12 April, to consider whether the current EVD outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to provide recommendations. Progress on the ground this week focused primarily on intensifying infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in and around outbreak hotspot areas. IPC teams are concentrating their efforts at addressing reluctance to decontamination activities amongst some local residents by actively engaging in regular direct dialogues with community leaders. Along with intensifying decontamination efforts, other IPC measures being undertaken include rapid evaluation of IPC practices in healthcare facilities and patients’ homes and identifying facilities at increased risk of contact with EVD cases. Results from these rapid evaluations demonstrated a range of IPC gaps depending on the type of facility, which were then promptly addressed through supplementary supervision. Reoccurring issues include limited knowledge of standard precautions, lack of triage and isolation capacity, insufficient supplies (e.g., of personal protective equipment), inappropriate waste management, and lack of capacity for decontaminating medical equipment. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining supportive supervision and mentorship at priority facilities throughout the response. WHO is confident that strengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the spread of EVD in the outbreak areas. WHO and partners in Risk Communication and Community Engagement are continuing with activities to build and maintain a trusting relationship between communities and the Ebola response teams. Dialogues with community committees are ongoing in the hotspot areas of Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi, and form a key part of a larger increase ownership of the Ebola response by the communities. Information about community disquiet are systematically collected and monitored to ensure that any misunderstanding leading to reluctance, refusal, or resistance of the Ebola response is followed up with and resolved as quickly as possible. This has been made possible by feedback from the community members, received through ongoing dialogue and various research activities within both the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring areas. In an effort to address the feedback received and specific concerns over the outbreak response, guided visits of the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) in various affected areas have been organized. Students and community associations who attended these guided visits to the ETCs can see first-hand how EVD patients are treated and help stop the potential dissemination of misinformation surrounding EVD and the ongoing response efforts. The security situation has remained calm for the past week as well. Provisional results released on 9 April by the Commission Électorale Nationale Indépendante concerning the national and provincial legislative elections in Beni, Butembo city (North Kivu), and Yumbi territory (Mai-Ndombe) have caused no significant unrest or disruption to outbreak response activities. The continued increase in cases this past week reflects the complex reality of conducting an effective outbreak response in a geographically difficult area with a highly fluid population, intermittent attacks by armed groups, and limited healthcare infrastructure. Despite these challenges, WHO and partners remain committed to limiting the spread of EVD amongst these vulnerable populations through the continued strengthening of our multi-faceted response efforts. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 9 April 2019* *Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. #### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 9 April 2019 ### Table 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 9 April 2019** **Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health. ### Public health response For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: ### WHO risk assessment WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity. ### WHO advice International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene. For more information, see: * * * 1The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and the availability of laboratory results. ',)",1186
"(' In Brazil, seasonal increases of yellow fever have historically occurred between December and May. During the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons, the number of yellow fever cases was much larger than in previous years (Figures 1 & 2). The increase in cases was partly due to a geographical expansion of the areas affected by yellow fever to include areas previously considered risk- free (Figure 3). In the current 2018- 2019 season (July 2018 to March 2019), a total of 75 confirmed human cases, including 17 deaths (case fatality rate = 23%), have been reported in Brazil in the states of São Paulo (62), Paraná (12), and Santa Catarina (1). Of these cases, 88% (66/75) are males, the median age is 43 years, and 71% (53/75) are rural workers. In the state of São Paulo, the municipalities that reported confirmed cases are: Eldorado (16), Iporanga (15), Barra do Turbo (6), Cajati (5), Cananeia (4), Jacupiranga (4), Pariquera-açu (4), Juquia (1), Registro (1), Serra Negra (1), Sete Barras (1), Ribeira (1), Vargem (1) and for 2 cases, the municipalities were unknown. In the state of Paraná, the municipalities with confirmed cases are: Guaraqueçaba (2), Antonina (2), São José dos Pinhais (2), Morretes (1), Andrinópolis (3), Paranaguá (1) and in 1 case, the municipality is unknown. The state of Santa Catarina reported one fatal confirmed human case of yellow fever. The case is a 36-year-old male, without vaccination, whose municipality is unknown. Likewise, in the same reporting period of July 2018 to March 2019, 33 confirmed epizootics were reported in five federal states: São Paulo (20), Rio de Janeiro (8), Minas Gerais (1), Mato Grosso (2), and Paraná (2). In the four weeks preceding this report, epizootics have been confirmed in São Paulo and Paraná states. #### Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed human yellow fever cases by year.

Source: Data published by the Brazil Ministry of Health and the São Paulo and Paraná State Secretariats of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO #### Figure 3. Distribution of epizootics and confirmed human cases in Brazil from July 2018 to March 2019. ### Public health response Given the geographical expansion in Brazil of the human cases and the epizootic wave in the last two seasonal periods, the country has had to adjust its immunization policies for yellow fever. The number of areas with recommended vaccination has increased from 3,526 municipalities in 2010 to 4,469 municipalities in 2018. In line with the World Health Organization guidelines, Brazil has adopted a single dose vaccination scheme for yellow fever since April 2017. The use of fractional doses was also adopted to respond to outbreaks and the risk of urbanization of yellow fever, especially in large cities. This strategy was implemented in response to the 2018 yellow fever outbreak in 77 municipalities with the greatest risk for yellow fever in the states of São Paulo (54 municipalities), Rio de Janeiro (15 municipalities), and Bahía (8 municipalities). Prior to the vaccination campaign, the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo had already vaccinated about 13.2 million people. During the campaign, an additional 13.3 million people were vaccinated in São Paulo, 6.5 million in Rio de Janeiro and 1.85 million in Bahia. This resulted in a vaccination coverage of 53.6%, 55.6%, and 55.0% respectively and across all 77 municipalities with the greatest risk of yellow fever1. Furthermore, data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health indicate that vaccination coverage of at least 95% was achieved in 17.8% (71/399) of the municipalities of Paraná, 23.7% (118/497) of the municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul and 14.9% (44/295) of the municipalities of Santa Catarina. ### WHO risk assessment Further transmission is expected in the coming months based on seasonal patterns. Recent human cases of yellow fever during the current seasonal cycle have been reported in São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina states in Southeast Brazil. The preliminary assessment of the vaccination coverage in municipalities from Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, and Santa Catarina states suggests a high proportion of persons remaining susceptible and the necessity to intensify communication to encourage greater vaccine uptake among groups at risk. The geographical distribution of human cases and epizootics from the current and previous two seasonal cycles (Figure 3) suggests southward movement of the virus, which presents further risk to the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina. Furthermore, these areas have ecosystems favourable for yellow fever transmission and borders with other countries such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. During the 2017-2018 yellow fever season, human cases of yellow fever acquired in Brazil were reported among travelers, most of whom arrived from countries where the vector is absent (or absent during winter). To date, yellow fever transmission by Aedes aegypti has not been documented. An investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute and reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of the yellow fever virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes captured in rural areas of 2 municipalities in Minas Gerais (Ituêta and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942. The sylvatic yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated. In entomological studies conducted in some of the affected states during the 2016-2017 outbreak, isolated Haemagogus mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever, indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. Currently, based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk as High at the national level, Moderate at the regional level, and Low at the global level. ### WHO advice On 25 January 2019, PAHO/WHO alerted2 Member States about the beginning of the seasonal period for yellow fever and therefore, the highest risk of transmission to unvaccinated humans. Thus, PAHO/WHO advises Member States with areas at-risk for yellow fever to continue efforts to immunize susceptible populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended. WHO recommends vaccination of international travelers above 9 months of age going to Brazil. The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travelers were updated by WHO on 3 May 20183; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website: Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization, if vaccine is administered at least 10 days before travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer life-long protection against yellow fever infection: a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed and should not be required of international travelers as a condition of entry. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable. WHO advises against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Brazil based on the information available for this event. ### Resources Information on the yellow fever situation in Brazil and other countries in the Americas is published regularly on the PAHO/WHO website and on the Brazil Ministry of Health website: Information on the yellow fever situation in São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina states are available at: For more information on yellow fever, please see: * * * 1This data is preliminary and subject to change.

"(' Although the security situation has subsided mildly into an unpredictable calm, the transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) continues to intensify in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with more than 100 confirmed cases reported this week. The main drivers behind the continued rise in cases stems from insecurity hampering access to critical hotspot areas, persistent pockets of poor community acceptance and hesitation to participate in response activities, and delayed detection and late presentation of EVD cases to Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs)/Transit Centres (TCs). Of particular concern are the community deaths resulting from the culmination of these factors. Community deaths denote all EVD (confirmed and probable) cases who died outside of an ETC/TC. This includes cases who die at home, as well as those who die within public/private hospitals and other health centres. On average, community deaths comprise approximately 40% of cases reported each week. This proportion fluctuates on a weekly basis, ranging from 28% to 43% of cases since the beginning of April after peaking as high as 71% in February. Of the total deaths (1147) currently listed in surveillance systems, approximately two thirds (68%) occurred outside of ETCs. Many of the patients who arrive at ETCs, often do so in a severe condition with a poor prognosis, and subsequently die shortly after admission. Community deaths also pose a major transmission risk as these cases have spent more time in the community while symptomatic and remain highly infectious at the time of their death and thereafter; propagating EVD to other members of the community such as family members and healthcare workers. Despite the continued increase in EVD cases, it should be noted that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Kalunguta, and Beni. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 350 cases reported in the last 21 days between 24 April – 14 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). A new case was also reported in the health zone of Alimbongo this week with links to cases deriving from Katwa. Current transmission patterns also illustrate the challenges resulting from cases originating from hotpot health zones and re-introducing the virus to areas where transmissions have previously been successfully halted. During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 18 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). As of 14 May, a total of 1739 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1147 died (case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (974) were female and 30% (514) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 102 (6% of total cases). Of the EVD patients who received care at ETCs, 459 have been successfully discharged. Risk communication and community engagement teams continue to spread messages about the importance of seeking care early at healthcare facilities for an increased chance of survival. These messages have been particularly effective in Beni, where affected individuals have been reporting to the ETCs more frequently and more rapidly after onset of symptoms. The risk communication and community engagement actors have been instrumental in mediating instances of reluctance and resistance at the community level to ensure peaceful agreements are reached and that other pillars of the response such as vaccination, infection prevention and control (IPC), and safe and dignified burials (SDB) are able to carry out their respective response activities. It is anticipated that the rising case figures will continue within the hotspot areas in the coming weeks given the resumption of most major response activities, which will lead to the detection of more cases. The increased transmission rates witnessed recently continue to demonstrate a heightened risk of EVD spreading to other neighbouring provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to surrounding countries. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone. Data as of 14 May 2019* *Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.

The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. Renewed efforts and honing of security mitigation measures, addressing procedural, operational and physical security means to ensure staff safety and security are undertaken. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time. ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene. For more information, please see: * * * ',)",1739
"(' Although this past week continues to bear witness to a steady rise in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the overall security situation has allowed for the resumption of most response activities. While no major insecurity incidents have occurred, outbreak response teams, local healthcare workers, and community members cooperating with response efforts, are increasingly subjected to threats made against them by armed groups present in hotspot areas such as Katwa and Butembo. These threats are often disseminated through leaflets or direct intimidation. Armed groups’ presence, activities and increasing direct threats against response teams continue to be reported in other EVD affected areas, in particular Lubero, Masereka, Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi, resulting in some healthcare workers being unwilling to don personal protective equipment or perform critical Infection Prevention Control (IPC) measures out of fear of violence being levied against them or the healthcare facilities where they operate. During the past three weeks, reports indicate that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, and Musienene. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 349 cases reported in the last 21 days between 1 - 21 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 15 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). As of 21 May, a total of 1866 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1241 died (case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (1051) were female and 30% (545) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 105 (6% of total cases). 490 EVD patients who received care at ETCs have been successfully discharged. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time. ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene. For more information, please see: * * * ',)",1866
"(' On 9 May 2019, the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) notified WHO of the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from an environmental sewage sample collected on 20 April 2019 in Konarak district, Sistan-Baluchistan province, Islamic Republic of Iran. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only, and to date, no associated cases of paralysis have been detected. The subsequent scheduled sewage sample collected from the same site on 4 May 2019 (2 weeks after the positive sample) tested negative for poliovirus. The affected province borders both Baluchistan province in Pakistan, and part of Southern Region in Afghanistan. Genetic sequencing confirmed that the virus isolated is most closely linked to WPV1 currently circulating in Karachi region (Sindh province) in Pakistan. The last laboratory-confirmed indigenous wild polio case from the Islamic Republic of Iran was reported in 1997. From 1998-2000, cases of wild poliovirus were imported from Pakistan and Afghanistan. No polio cases have been confirmed since 2001. Routine immunization against polio has been mandatory since 1984. Highly organized and well-implemented national immunization days were held during the period from 1994 to 1998. Since 1999, supplementary immunization activities in high-risk areas and populations including province of Sistan-Baluchistan are conducted annually. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. The findings reconfirmed that immunization and surveillance systems in the Islamic Republic of Iran are strong. ### WHO risk assessment WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV-1 from the Islamic Republic of Iran to be low. The risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran’s very high levels of routine immunization coverage for OPV3 (3 doses of oral polio vaccine), estimated at 99%, and strong disease surveillance. However, this event reinforces the importance of implementing the Temporary Recommendations of the International Health Regulations (IHR) committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus by the Member States infected with WPV1, which include Afghanistan and Pakistan. ### WHO advice Polio is a highly infectious disease and can cause permanent paralysis or death. The poliovirus can spread easily and over large distances. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travellers and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas should be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. The twentieth meeting of the Emergency Committee under IHR regarding the international spread of poliovirus, held in February 2019 concluded that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, States infected with wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) with potential risk of international spread, and states infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) with potential risk of international spread should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. ### For more information: ',)",0
"(' A decline in the number of confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases has been reported this week (22 to 28 May). Over the past seven days, a total of 73 new confirmed cases were reported compared to the previous where 127 new confirmed cases were reported. This should be interpreted with caution given the complex operating environment and fragility of the security situation. Katwa, one of the epicenters of the outbreak, reported fewer cases this week and other health zones such as Mabalako, Kalunguta and Mandima have also seen a decline in case reporting. Active transmission was reported in 14 of the 22 health zones that have been affected to date. Other initial encouraging findings such as a lower proportion of reported nosocomial infections, a lower proportion of community deaths and a higher proportion of registered contacts at case detection have also been reported. Weekly fluctuations in these indicators have been reported in the past and uncertainties remain with regards to the ability of the surveillance system to identify all new cases in areas faced with ongoing insecurity. Operations are still regularly hampered by security issues, and the risk of national and regional spread remains very high. Mabalako reported 24% (73/309) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Nine out of the 12 Mabalako health areas have reported new confirmed cases during this period. In the 21 days between 8 to 28 May 2019, 83 health areas within 14 health zones reported new cases, representing 46% of the 180 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 309 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (24%, n=73), Butembo (21%, n=64), Katwa (14%, n=42), Beni (11%, n=34), Kalunguta (10%, n=31), Musienene (7%, n=23) and Mandima (6%, n=20) health zones. As of 28 May 2019, a total of 1945 EVD cases, including 1851 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1302 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1208 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 1945 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1122) were female, and 29% (572) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 108 (6% of total cases). All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. On 3 June, a pilgrimage is planned to Namugongo, Uganda to commemorate the death of Catholics and Anglican martyrs. Preparedness activities surrounding the pilgrimage are ongoing. ### EVD Cases in Under Five-Year Olds WHO periodically conducts in-depth epidemiological analyses so that data can help reveal any gaps and drive evidence-based response improvements. An in- depth analysis of EVD cases in children under five-years of age demonstrated some noteworthy trends. As of 28 May, children under the age of five accounted for 15% (300/1949) of EVD cases reported, with children under one year of age accounting for 6% (118/1949). Of the 300 cases in children under the age of five, 19 were probable cases (19/94, 20% of all probable cases). Data indicate that children under the age of five are being brought into healthcare facilities sooner than cases over the age of five (2.4 days vs. 3.2 days respectively), but most of these cases are not being referred to ETCs, and instead attend multiple local healthcare facilities. These cases visited on average 1.5 healthcare facilities, compared to 1.2 healthcare facilities for cases aged over five-years of age. These observations show that in general, parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities but are reluctant to bringing their children to ETCs, perhaps out of fear of being far from home and without the support of family members. More work needs to be done to reduce fear and misunderstanding of ETCs and to reduce any other barriers to access, with a special focus on this age group. All cases that may not be adequately isolated including children under five-years of age may pose a considerable transmission risk to healthcare workers, patients, and members of the community. With regards to contact-tracing, 28% of EVD cases under five-years of age are registered as contacts, compared to 41% in cases over five-years of age. Although EVD cases under five years of age are less frequently listed as contacts, proportions of cases both below and over five-years of age are under surveillance remain similar (18% vs. 20% respectively). The reasons underlying these low figures are unclear at this time and further investigations are ongoing. As of 28 May, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of EVD cases in children under the age of five stands at 77%. This CFR was notably higher than that of EVD cases over five-years of age at 57%. These figures are in line with those observed in the 2014 West Africa EVD outbreak1 . There are a number of possible explanations for the higher CFR in this vulnerable population: the lower proportion of cases that present to ETCs, higher baseline mortalities in this population in general, and the inability to vaccinate cases who were not listed as contacts. Community deaths (i.e. any EVD deaths occurring outside of Ebola treatment centres/Transit centres (ETCs/TCs) account for 76% of deaths due to EVD in children under the age of five and 65% above the age of five. Of the community deaths of children under the age of five, 54% died in a healthcare facility. As expected, the CFRs of EVD cases both younger and older than five-years of age (50% and 39% respectively) who sought treatment at ETCs is markedly lower than those who did not (86% and 68% respectively). The relative difference in CFRs between the two groups reduces upon admission into an ETC. This again reinforces the need to continue strengthening efforts to work with communities to encourage all affected populations, and in particular parents of young children, to seek treatment at ETCs as early as possible in order to give them the best chance of survival. Overall, the fact that these observed trends indicate that while it is promising to see lower CFRs in young children treated in ETCs, and to see that parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities, much emphasis needs to be made at improving contact listing of children under five years of age and encouraging parents to bring their children to be treated in ETCs. It must also be stressed that the proportions and resultant associations described above must be interpreted with caution given the often-limited demographic information available and are subject to change due to the fluid nature of the ongoing EVD outbreak. Efforts are ongoing to encourage community-based facilities to refer suspected cases to ETCs/TCs, however these activities can be further strengthened. Children of all ages, including infants, that have suspected or confirmed EVD, are cared for at ETUs with specific optimized, supportive care protocols. Paediatric-specific equipment, medicines and trained specialists are available to provide clinical support at ETCs for this age group. All confirmed children are also rapidly enrolled in investigational therapeutic protocols after informed consent is obtained. Children receive nutritional care and psychosocial support from psychologists while at the ETC and are cared for 24/7 by care providers from survivors so they are not alone. As with all age groups, infants and young children are offered support via a specialized programme of care for Ebola survivors. In addition, pregnant women that have survived EVD are followed closely in the survivor program and return to ETCs for delivery by a multi-disciplinary team that has obstetric and paediatric expertise. In light of these findings, UNICEF and WHO are working with partners in supporting activities related to nutritional care and psychosocial support of EVD patients, particularly for parents and children. These include supporting and providing information related to infant feeding for children separated from their parents or orphaned. UNICEF is working with EVD survivors and creating infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counselling support groups. They are also supporting the screening of malnourished children under two years old and their referral to Nutritional Units for assistance. Psychosocial support and material assistance are being conducted in outbreak areas where nurseries for children who have been separated from their mothers are set up and psychosocial support is provided to family members accompanying EVD affected persons and their contacts. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

"(' As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak surpasses the 2000 case mark, indicators over the past two weeks provide early signs of an easing of the transmission intensity. This follows a period of improved security and therefore access to communities, allowing response teams to operate more freely. A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past two epidemiological weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April. Declines in the incidence of new cases have been most apparent in hotspots such as Katwa, Mandima and Beni health zones. Concurrently, improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset (up from 30% three weeks ago to 55% last week), and a lower proportion of cases resulting from transmission within community health facilities (from 31% during the first week of April 2019 to 9% during the last week of May 2019), are encouraging. Nevertheless, both indicators are below where we would aim to be. The outbreak continues to be contained within 12 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. However, substantive rates of transmission continue within affected communities, and further waves of the outbreak may be expected. An increase in the incidence of new cases has been reported from Mabalako Health Zone in recent weeks, and high infection rates continue within Butembo metropolitan. Times between detecting, reporting and admission of cases at Ebola treatment/transit centres (ETCs) remains too long (median 6 days, interquartile range 4–9 days in the past 3 weeks), with about a third (34% in the past 3 weeks) of cases dying outside of ETCs. Collectively these indicators highlight that the risks associated with this outbreak remain very high. In the 21 days between 15 May to 4 June 2019, 80 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 12% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 280 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (27%, n=75), Butembo (23%, n=63), Katwa (16%, n=44), Beni (11%, n=30), Kalunguta (8%, n=23), Mandima (7%, n=19) and Musienene (5%, n=14) health zones. As of 4 June 2019, a total of 2025 EVD cases, including 1931 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1357 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1263 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2025 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1170) were female, and 29% (589) were children aged less than 18 years.

A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions.

"(' On 23 May 2019, WHO received notification through the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from an environmental sample collected on 20 April 2019 in a hospital in Northern Cameroon which borders Borno state in Nigeria and Chad. In this region, the vaccine coverage in 2018 for inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV1) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV3) was 73% and 72% respectively. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only – no associated cases of paralysis have been detected so far. Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolate is associated with the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in neighboring Nigeria which originated in Jigawa state and spread to other areas of Nigeria, as well as internationally to the Republic of Niger in 2018. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health and local health authorities have been involved in the response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria and across the the Lake Chad sub region (Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria) by providing monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2). A thorough investigation of the incident is ongoing with the support of partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and includes assessing the extent of circulation of this strain, identifying sub-national immunity gaps and supporting efforts to strengthen sub-national surveillance sensitivity. ### WHO risk assessment This event highlights the risk of renewed international spread of cVDPV2 from Nigeria and the rest of the Lake Chad region, given the large-scale population movement; subnational immunity and surveillance gaps across the Lake Chad region. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. WHO will continue to support the ongoing investigation and risk assessment by national authorities. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, particularly those reporting frequent travel to polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect imported cases and facilitate a rapid response. All countries should maintain a high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the impact of new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC which requires an outbreak of poliovirus to be declared as a national public health emergency and all international travellers to be vaccinated. Likewise, countries with the risk of exporting poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure. ',)",0
"(' The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to show a decrease in the number of new cases in hotspots such as Katwa, Beni and Kalunguta health zones. However, in other areas such as Mabalako and Butembo, moderate rates of transmission continue. With ongoing EVD transmission within communities in 12 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, factors such as persistent delays in case detection, approximately a third of cases dying outside of Ebola treatment or transit centres, and high population mobility, pose a high risk of geographical spread both within the DRC and to neighbouring countries. This was highlighted by the recent exportation of cases to Uganda – the first confirmed cases detected outside of North Kivu and Ituri province since the onset of the outbreak over 10 months ago. For more information, please see Disease Outbreak News on EVD in Uganda Weekly decrease in the incidence of new cases have been reported in several health zones; however, increase or a continuation of the outbreak has been observed in others (Figure 1). In the 21 days, between 22 May to 11 June 2019, 62 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 9% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 212 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (33%, n=69), Butembo (18%, n=39), Katwa (14%, n=30) Mandima (11%, n=23) and Beni (9%, n=20). Single confirmed cases were also reported from Rwampara and Komanda health zones this past week following a prolonged period since the last reported case, with both cases acquiring the infection in the aforementioned hotspots. As of 11 June 2019, a total of 2084 EVD cases, including 1990 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1405 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1311 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2084 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1194) were female, and 29% (605) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 118 (6% of total cases). Taking these recent events into consideration, the WHO Director-General will convene the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) on 14 June 2019. The independent group of public health experts will provide their views to the Director-General on whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). If the event is determined to constitute a PHEIC, the Director-General will issue Temporary Recommendations, which are usually health measures aimed at reducing the international spread of Ebola and avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic. A statement giving an account of the meeting and its conclusions will be posted on the WHO website immediately after the meeting. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up. ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene. For more information, please see: * * * ',)",2084

"(' 10 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported Hurricane Mitch approached the coast of Honduras on 27 October as a Category V hurricane. At that point, and subsequently for a number of days, it stalled off the coast, producing very heavy rainfall. The rains in many countries in Central America, caused rivers to overflow and provoked serious mudslides in many areas. To date, it has been very difficult to finalize an evaluation of health sector needs because of conditions in the country. There are no communications within the country. Tegucigalpa is inaccessible from the north, south and west of the country, making it very difficult for fuel and food to arrive. The roads to the north and to the south are seriously damaged. At this writing, more than 5,000 people have lost their lives, approximately 1.5 million persons have been affected, 500,000 have been evacuated, an estimated 70,000 homes have been damaged. (These figures are conservative.) The 50-bed San Lorenzo Hospital was destroyed. The Social Security Hospital is not serviceable. The roof of the Roatan Hospital was totally destroyed. Other units of the health services network suffered considerable damages, and are without electrical energy and water supply. A large percentage of health workers are themselves among the affected and/or evacuated. Some of the most pressing needs are for medicines and other critical supplies; vector control; adequate collection and treatment of solid waste; rehabilitation of primary health services; health education and communication; equipment for the San Lorenzo Hospital; and assessment of the damages and project design for the rehabilitation phase. The water distribution system is damaged, and the network needs urgent repair. The majority of surface water outlets have disappeared. In coming weeks, Tegucigalpa will suffer water rationing, and even the areas that can be repaired most quickly will only have water once or twice a week. Nicaragua\'s National Civil Defense System has provided the following figures (as of 4 November) on the number of people affected by Hurricane Mitch: Families Adults Children Injured Deaths Missing 136,930 405,526 342,037 229 1,368 1,804 The Pacific and northern regions of the country were most affected. In addition to the actual and potential loss of life, the principal damages can be summarized as follows: * In addition to the widespread threat of vector borne diseases, there is a severe threat of diarrhea, respiratory and dermatological diseases. * Much of the country\'s infrastructure was partially or totally destroyed, including 2500 km. of roads and more than 80 bridges. * Environmental deterioration, contamination and destruction of basic services such as water supply systems, wells, latrines, as well as an increase in the number of areas which have become a breeding ground for vectors. * Generalized overcrowding in shelters designed to accommodate fewer people, with a lack of proper waste management services. #### EL SALVADOR There has been a great deal of damage to infrastructure in this country. The death toll is 239 and 60,000 people have been displaced and are being housed in 107 shelters throughout the country. In spite of efforts by national authorities to adequately house all of the population who need shelter, health and sanitation conditions may deteriorate in the current conditions persist for a lengthy period of time.

"(' 14 July 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported Malaria epidemics in Kenya have become periodic since the 1980s. They have been characterized by transmission upsurges in the highlands in the western part of the country, and more recently in the semiarid north-eastern area, after the 1997 El Nino rains. These outbreaks were generally contained by case management, but the strategy began to fail with increasing chloroquine resistance. This year the epidemic districts were supplied with sulfa- pyrimethamine (SP) at the latest by end-April after the onset of the long rainy season. As a result, the outbreak was kept in check during the early stages, but as the intensity of transmission increased at the beginning of May, the number of patients outstripped the capacity of the health facilities, leading to a severe management crisis at all levels including in drug procurement systems. Although a general upsurge of malaria cases has been reported in most of the districts which usually experience epidemics, the following 9 districts have been more severely affected: Buret, Gucha, Kisii, Mount Elgon, Narok, Nyamira, Trans Mara, Trans Nzoia and West Pokot. The epidemic was first reported in Kisii, Mount Elgon, Trans Mara, Trans Nzoia and West Pokot districts, but has since spread to other districts (Gucha, Nandi, Nyamira and Uasin Gishu). Although other areas which regularly report epidemics such as Bomet, Kakamega, Samburu and Turkana have not yet been affected, they are being monitored closely since it is still the traditionally epidemic season for most of them. The Ministry of Health had established large stocks of antimalarial drugs in the 15 epidemic districts (including North-Eastern province) by the end of April, but these stocks have now been exhausted in most districts owing to the unusually severe outbreak this year. The central supplies unit in Nairobi has also issued all its quinine stocks, and other antimalarial drugs such as SP are fast running out. In line with the new national guidelines on epidemic preparedness and control. communities are being mobilized to: seek treatment early; attend to personal protection measures including the use of insecticide-treated nets; and participate in antivector activities such as indoor residual spraying, larviciding and environmental management. It has now become clear that case management alone cannot attenuate these epidemics, and an integrated approach to malaria control is needed. Mortality rates are still at emergency level, and they are not expected to decrease, as the number of new cases continues to rise. Environmental conditions are still suitable for mosquito breeding. WHO staff in the country and from the Regional Office for Africa and headquarters are fully mobilized. Malaria control activities are being coordinated in collaboration with NGOs such as MSF-France, MERLIN and World Vision. Contacts are being made with other NGOs, and bilateral and multilateral agencies for their possible support. ',)",7

"(' ### Situation in China, status of scientific and clinical knowledge 14 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported Situation in China China has today reported 109 new probable cases of SARS and 6 deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 1418 cases and 64 deaths. The largest number of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were reported. In addition, two provinces reported SARS cases for the first time – 10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian. The reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system, recently introduced by Chinese authorities, is working to detect and report cases. However, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with the challenge of SARS. Last week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that the health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases of SARS occurred in mid-November, had responded well to the outbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of other provinces, that lack Guangdong’s strong health system, to respond promptly and effectively to SARS. While Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some hospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit military hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO staff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official response to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing. WHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China. Shanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request and follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and will soon travel to China. Status of scientific knowledge Canadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will boost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a vaccine. The rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by collaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at laboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March. A PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been shown to be ten times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for SARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll out by the end of this week. Status of clinical knowledge Data available to WHO indicate that 96% of persons developing SARS recover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4% who are dying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday to gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and pool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of 213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1 in each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported four probable cases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have other causes. China, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected area. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most seriously affected area. Three of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend occurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a previously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or in persons with pre-existing disease.

"(' ### Situation in China, more than 6000 cases globally, areas with recent local transmission 2 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported Situation in China China reported 176 new probable SARS cases today, 96 of which were in Beijing. These numbers bring the cumulative total in China to 3799 and 1636 in the capital. Eleven deaths were reported, accounting for a cumulative total of 181 deaths. Inner Mongolia reported a jump of 26 in probable SARS cases, for a total of 180 cases in that province. Other provinces reporting new cases include Hebei (14), Guangdong (9), Jilin (5) and Shanxi (4). A WHO field visit to one large hospital not officially designated as a SARS hospital demonstrated the urgent need to review strategies for infection control procedures. Current infection control practices in emergency rooms may need to be modified, since health care workers continue to be infected. Among front-line health workers, 15 new cases were reported in Beijing. There are now 300 infected health care workers. 9 more cases among health workers were also reported in Tianjin. WHO team members in Beijing continue working with officials from the city’s municipal health authorities to analyze epidemiological trends, but much missing data remain to be collected, and reports from case investigations must still be completed. “The public needs to have more information on when and where infection is happening,” said Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO’s representative in China. “We don’t know that right now.” Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6054 probable SARS cases with 417 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 207 new cases and 26 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (2), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (8), and Taiwan (5). Taiwan, which has a rapidly evolving outbreak, reported today a cumulative total of 100 probable cases, with 11 new cases compared with yesterday. Eight SARS deaths have occurred in Taiwan. Canada reported 2 new probable cases today. Areas with recent local transmission As of today, WHO is now issuing daily lists of countries having areas where local transmission has occurred within the past 20 days. Local transmission occurs when one or more probable cases of SARS most likely acquired their infection locally, regardless of the setting, as opposed to cases in which infection was acquired in another country. The new list, which replaces the previous list of affected areas, also stratifies the extent of local transmission into low, medium, and high categories. ',)",7146
"(' 7 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported ### SARS case fatality ratio, incubation period Case fatality ratio WHO has today revised its initial estimates of the case fatality ratio of SARS. The revision is based on an analysis of the latest data from Canada, China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and Viet Nam. On the basis of more detailed and complete data, and more reliable methods, WHO now estimates that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14% to 15%. The likelihood of dying from SARS in a given area has been shown to depend on the profile of the cases, including the age group most affected and the presence of underlying disease. Based on data received by WHO to date, the case fatality ratio is estimated to be less than 1% in persons aged 24 years or younger, 6% in persons aged 25 to 44 years, 15% in persons aged 45 to 64 years, and greater than 50% in persons aged 65 years and older. A case fatality ratio measures the proportion of all people with a disease who will die from the disease. In other words, it measures the likelihood that a disease will kill its host, and is thus an important indicator of the severity of a disease and its significance as a public health problem. The likelihood that a person will die of SARS could be influenced by factors related to the SARS virus, the route of exposure and dose (amount) of virus, personal factors such as age or the presence of another disease, and access to prompt medical care. Many factors complicate efforts to calculate a case fatality ratio while an outbreak is still evolving. Deaths from SARS typically occur after several weeks of illness. Full recovery may take even longer. While an epidemic is still evolving, only some of the individuals affected by the disease will have died or recovered. Only at the end of an epidemic can an absolute value be calculated, taking into account total deaths, total recoveries and people lost to follow-up. Calculating case fatality as the number of deaths reported divided by the number of cases reported irrespective of the time elapsed since they became ill gives an underestimate of the true case fatality ratio. One method of overcoming this difficulty is to calculate the case fatality ratio using only those cases whose final outcome – died or recovered – is known. However, this method, when applied before an outbreak is over, gives an overestimate because the average time from illness onset to death for SARS is shorter than the average time from illness onset to recovery. With these methods, estimates of the case fatality ratio range from 11% to 17% in Hong Kong, from 13% to 15% in Singapore, from 15% to 19% in Canada, and from 5% to 13% in China. A more accurate and unbiased estimation of case fatality for SARS can be obtained with a third method, survival analysis. This method relies on detailed individual data on the time from illness onset to death or full recovery, or time since illness onset for current cases. Using this method, WHO estimates that the case fatality ratio is 14% in Singapore and 15% in Hong Kong. In Viet Nam, where SARS has been contained and measurement is more straightforward, case fatality was comparatively low, at 8%. One explanation for this is the large number of total cases that occurred in younger, previously healthy health care workers. Incubation period WHO has also reviewed estimates of the incubation period of SARS, using individual case data. On the basis of this review, WHO continues to conclude that the current best estimate of the maximum incubation period is 10 days. The incubation period, which is the time from exposure to a causative agent to onset of disease, is particularly important as it forms the basis for many recommended control measures, including contact tracing and the duration of home isolation for contacts of probable SARS cases. Knowledge about the incubation period can also help physicians make diagnostic decisions about whether the presenting symptoms and clinical history of a patient point to SARS or to some other disease. The incubation period can vary from one case to another according to the route by which the person was exposed, the dose of virus received, and other factors, including immune status. Estimates of the incubation period are further complicated by the fact that some patients have had opportunities for multiple exposures to the virus. The particular exposure that caused disease may prove impossible to determine. For these reasons, the most reliable estimates of the incubation period are based on a study of cases having a single documented exposure to a known case. In today’s review, WHO has analysed the incubation periods of individuals with well-defined single-point exposures in Singapore, Canada, and Europe. Findings support the original estimate of 10 days as the maximum incubation period. However, one recently published analysis of data from Hong Kong estimates a longer maximum incubation period in a group of 57 patients. This analysis, which may be significant and important for disease control, will be studied in more detail. The longer incubation period could reflect differences in methodology, specificity of diagnosis, route of transmission, infectious dose, or other factors. Reliable diagnosis – determining that all cases diagnosed as SARS are true cases of the disease – has been particularly difficult to establish in this outbreak, as diagnosis is made based on a set of non- specific symptoms and clinical signs that are seen in several other diseases. Prompt isolation WHO continues to recommend the earliest possible isolation of all suspect and probable cases of SARS. A short time between onset of symptoms and isolation reduces opportunities for transmission to others. It also reduces the number of contacts requiring active follow-up, and thus helps relieve some of the burden on health services. In addition, prompt hospitalization gives patients the best chance of receiving possibly life-saving care should their condition take a critical course. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6903 probable SARS cases and 495 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 186 new cases and 17 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (5), Hong Kong SAR (11) and Taiwan (1). ',)",143

"(' 19 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported ### Report on Guangxi (China) visit, situation in Taiwan, risk of SARS transmission during air travel Report on Guangxi (China) visit Guangxi Province appears to be responding well to its relatively small SARS outbreak, with the disease given high priority by both populations and health officials. This conclusion was reached by WHO experts following a joint field visit with Ministry of Health officials. To date, Guangxi has reported 22 probable SARS cases and 3 deaths. Some concern had been expressed that this “poverty province”, with its weak health infrastructure, would not be able to cope with a SARS outbreak. “We found the province well mobilized. There appears to be no major epidemic there,” said WHO team leader CK Lee. The team returned last Saturday to Beijing after a week-long visit in the province. Experts found an effective surveillance system set up to detect cases. Diagnostic procedures, treatment, and infection control at all hospitals visited was considered adequate. While no evidence of concealment of cases was found, the numbers of probable SARS cases could be higher due to problems with how cases are being defined. The team found that two separate clusters of SARS cases, dating from December and January, had recently been detected by local health officials following a review of hospital records. Guangxi’s surveillance system, which is similar to that of Hebei Province, relies on active, rigorous community-based surveillance, close checking of migrants returning home, and quarantine for two weeks in certain cases. An adequate case reporting system has been set up, with detailed reports sent daily from each city or prefecture to the provincial level. According to official records, some 260,000 migrant workers returned to Guangxi between April 1 and May 8, of whom 200,000 workers came from neighbouring Guangdong province. Surveillance checkpoints have been set up at main entry points into the province to register these workers. Screening teams staffed by township hospital doctors also visit villages to monitor returning workers. Hospital management appeared to be effective. Due to scrupulous infection control, no health care workers have been reported as infected. However, some measures taken may be unwarranted, unsustainable or even inappropriate. For example, health care workers are using three layers of hats, gowns, gloves and masks. Two of the three masks are made up of a 12-layer gauze material. Experts are also concerned that the numbers of reported cases may be low, due to how cases are being classified under the probable, suspect and “under observation” categories. WHO experts are further investigating this issue and working with the Ministry of Health to bring the national standard case definitions more in line with WHO case definitions. In a separate development, WHO has requested that joint research be undertaken to investigate the origins of the coronavirus to predict its possible reintroduction into the community. Situation in Taiwan Taiwan has today reported a cumulative total of 344 probable SARS cases with 40 deaths. On 17 May Taiwan reported 34 new cases, and 36 new cases were reported the following day, making Taiwan the most rapidly growing outbreak at present. As the SARS situation in Taiwan has evolved quickly, with cases now being reported in at least six hospitals, it is possible that the large number of cases being reported daily represents a backlog of cases that are only now being recognized as SARS. Lapses in infection control, particularly in emergency rooms, may have been one reason for the rapid increase in cases, particularly in hospitals. Local authorities are focusing on improving their infection control measures. Cases are now less likely to go unrecognized in emergency rooms, many of which have been reorganized to minimize the risk of further SARS transmission. A new monitoring system will also establish guidelines and procedures for the assignment of hospital beds in isolation wards. The department of health has established a 24-hour case reporting system to handle SARS reports made by physicians and hospitals. Delays in case reporting are punishable by law, and in the severest cases, subject to imprisonment. Taiwan authorities have adopted thorough contact tracing and quarantine measures to prevent further spread. The joint WHO-CDC team in Taiwan is working to ensure that detailed practical guidelines, developed by Hong Kong, Singapore, and other successful initial outbreak sites, are being made available to Taiwanese authorities. In particular, guidance on the safe screening of persons presenting with fever, and advice on policies for home quarantine and prevention of spread within schools are being shared by teams at other outbreak sites. Officials in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second largest city, have adopted contingency plans for the city, county and region. Should Kaohsiung exceed the simulated level of preparedness, the next level involves military intervention. The city’s level of preparedness in hospitals appears to be good WHO is confident that Taiwan will bring the outbreak under control using methods of case detection, isolation and good infection control in hospitals, vigorous contact tracing and follow-up surveillance, and public education and information that have proven their effectiveness in other areas. Additional WHO support staff will be sent to Taiwan soon. Risk of SARS transmission during air travel Globally, WHO has analysed information, as of 12 May, on 35 flights in which a probable symptomatic SARS case was among the passengers or crew. To date, symptomatic probable SARS cases on four of these flights have been associated with possible transmission of infection to fellow passengers or crew. The most recent flight during which SARS may have been transmitted from a probable symptomatic case to another fellow passenger, seated next to each other, occurred on 23 March during a flight from Bangkok to Beijing. On 27 March, WHO issued recommendations for the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission. In some areas that have experienced severe SARS outbreaks, including Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, measures being applied at airports exceed those recommended by WHO. In these areas, prompt detection and isolation of cases, and rigorous tracing and home confinement or quarantine of all contacts have served as the first line of protection against the risk that an infectious person could board an aircraft. Stringent measures for export screening confer yet another level of protection. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7864 probable SARS cases with 643 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 116 new cases and 20 deaths when compared with the last global update on Saturday. The new deaths occurred in China (7), Hong Kong (8), and Taiwan (5). ',)",277
"(' 21 May 2003 Note for the Press As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that people planning to travel to Taiwan province, China, consider postponing all but essential travel. This is an extension of the advice issued on 8 May recommending the postponing of non-essential travel to Taipei, and is based on information received by the WHO detailing the spread of SARS beyond that city. This temporary travel advice will be reassessed regularly. Following global alerts about SARS, issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number. On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission of SARS, continue to apply. (see SARS site ) Information about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Taiwan province, China, has been carefully reviewed by WHO. The travel advice is based on a consideration of the magnitude of the outbreaks in the area, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases. The extent of local chains of transmission as well as the potential for spread beyond these areas were also major factors in the reasoning for this advice. WHO travel advice is issued to protect international public health and to reduce opportunities for further global spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage. The SARS situation is assessed on a regular basis to determine whether the status of areas listed for travel advice needs to be modified, whether other areas need to be added, and if additional precautionary measures are required. Current travel advice, whereby WHO recommends that people consider postponing all but essential travel, are now in effect for several areas of China, namely: Beijing, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Taiwan and Tianjin.

"(' 27 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported ### SARS resolution approved, situation in Taiwan World Health Assembly adopts resolution on SARS Today in Geneva, more than 190 countries participating in the World Health Assembly – the supreme governing body of WHO – unanimously approved a resolution on SARS. The Assembly also considered a report (.pdf)on the emergence and spread of SARS and on the international response to date. The text of the resolution was based on a draft proposed by a group of Asian countries, and then fine-tuned during more than 7 hours of collaborative work by 37 nations. The group was chaired by Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a senior member of Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health. The resolution, which recognizes SARS as “the first severe infectious disease to emerge in the twenty-first century”, calls for the full support of all countries to control SARS and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It also urges countries “to report cases promptly and transparently and to provide requested information to WHO.” Countries are further asked to request WHO support when “control measures employed are ineffective in halting the spread of disease.” In the resolution and in the debate that preceded its adoption, SARS was clearly recognized as a serious threat to the stability and growth of economies, the livelihood of populations, and the functioning of health systems as well as a cause of great human suffering. Lessons learned in the ongoing response to SARS were considered relevant to improved preparedness for the next new disease, the next influenza pandemic, and a possible act of bioterrorism. While WHO was asked to continue to update the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the resolution acknowledges the need to do so in a way that minimizes the socioeconomic consequences. A statement made by the Italian delegation, praising the dedication of all health care workers, including several who have lost their lives to SARS, met with a round of applause. In a related item, also considered today, delegates approved a resolution setting out procedures and a timetable for revision of the International Health Regulations. The Regulations, which are administered by WHO, provide the legal framework for global surveillance and reporting of infectious diseases. They also provide the only mechanism through which measures to prevent international spread can be enforced. Basically unchanged since 1969, the Regulations are considered grossly inadequate in protecting nations and the international community against the resurgence of the infectious disease threat, which has resulted in the emergence of around 30 new diseases during the past two decades. As many speakers noted, this threat, dramatically illustrated by SARS, is amplified by conditions in a highly mobile, interconnected, and closely interdependent world. As the revision process will not be completed before 2005, the resolution adopted by consensus today requests WHO, through its Director-General, to take into account information about epidemics from sources other than official government notifications, and to conduct on-the-spot studies within countries to ensure that control measures are adequate to prevent international spread. These newly authorized functions are expected to strengthen WHO’s capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics quickly and with sufficient force to prevent spread to neighbouring countries and others. Situation in Taiwan A WHO official in Taiwan has today reported important strides forward in strengthening hospital infection control and contact tracing. Health officials have launched a widespread information campaign, set up a major screening programme and established fever clinics to keep persons suspected of having SARS out of contact with others. In the assessment of WHO, these efforts are beginning to bear fruit. The situation in Taiwan is expected to improve gradually in the coming days and weeks. Thirteen new probable cases and 4 new deaths were reported today from Taiwan. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8221 probable SARS cases with 735 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 24 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (4). ',)",178

"(' 18 August 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported The WHO team in Monrovia is continuing to assess the cholera situation, visiting cholera treatment centres and sanitation and water facilities. Data on the number of cases and deaths is very difficult to obtain (see previous report). There have been cholera outbreaks in previous years in Monrovia, especially during the rainy season. However, at the start of the outbreak in early June this year there were approximately 200 cases per week, compared with 30 cases per week during the same period in 2001 and 2002. In July 2003, there were 350 severe cases per week; during the week of 11-18 August, there were 240 severe cases of cholera. The number of cases is likely to increase in the near future because of the movement of population and the lack of safe water. The increased level of malnutrition has also added to the risk of more severe cases of cholera. Working with partners, WHO plans to reactivate the cholera control committee, disseminate health education material and work to mass cholrinate wells as soon as possible. ',)",30
"(' 25 August 2003 An outbreak of respiratory illness in an aged care facility in Canada has now been extensively investigated for SARS and WHO concludes the disease is not SARS. On 14 August, Canadian public health officials reported to WHO that an unidentified respiratory disease in a Surrey, British Columbia health care facility had infected 143 residents and staff. Some initial testing suggested the SARS coronavirus may have played a role. Now, WHO and Canadian health authorities have gathered enough evidence to conclude that the outbreak in British Columbia is not SARS. Analysis from laboratories in Canada and the United States did not confirm the initial concern that SARS had mutated into a milder disease. Two lines of evidence have converged to dismiss the SARS concern. Clinically, the disease itself was strikingly different from the SARS outbreak in the spring. The features of the current outbreak included a low case fatality, runny nose, lack of fever in most patients, and no SARS-like changes in the lung seen on X-ray. Now, sequencing of a portion of the virus causing the outbreak has led to the finding that it was not the SARS coronavirus but another human coronavirus known as OC43. This virus, which is one of the causes of the common cold, has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in aged care facilities in other countries. In terms of SARS, Canada continues to be a safe destination for travellers and travellers from Canada pose no exceptional risk to other countries. This outbreak has no international public health implications. ',)",3889
"(' 30 September 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported As of 29 September 2003, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, has reported a total of 90 cases from 8 districts (Tonkolili, Bombali, Kenema, Koinadugu, Porto Loko, Kambia and Kono) in the country (see previous report). Of the 90 cases, there are 4 laboratory confirmed cases, all from Tonkolili district, and 10 deaths. The Ministry of Health and Sanitation conducted a mass immunization campaign (100 000 doses) from 22-31 August in 4 out of 11 chiefdoms in the Tonkolili district. Most of the suspected cases and all of the laboratory confirmed cases come from these chiefdoms. Last week, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever provided the Ministry with 150 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine to implement a mass immunization campaign in the 7 remaining chiefdoms of Tonkolili district. This campaign is planned to start in the first week of October. The WHO West Africa sub-regional team is helping to strengthen surveillance in the affected areas and to coordinate the response.

"(' 21 November 2003 Since the beginning of October, outbreaks of influenza in a number of countries in Europe and North America have been due largely to A(H3N2) viruses; whereas, A(H1) viruses were responsible for outbreaks in Iceland. Influenza activity has continued to increase during November in Canada, Finland, France, Israel, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). In Europe (Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), most H3N2 viruses that have been characterized antigenically so far this season were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; in the UK, 2/3 of isolates characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and one third were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In Canada, more than a half of the A(H3N2) isolates characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, while the rest were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the US, more than ¾ of the A(H3N2) isolates were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the last eight weeks, five deaths in children, two in England and three in Scotland, have been confirmed as due to A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus. A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains are drift variants of the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine virus. Therefore antibodies produced against the A/Panama/2007/99-like strain(see WER 2003 78(9): 58-62 and WER 2003 87(11):77 ) do cross-react with A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, but at a lower level. For example, in laboratory tests of sera from recipients of influenza vaccines currently used in the northern hemisphere, there were on average 41% reductions in the post-immunization antibody titres to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, when compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain. However despite such reductions, the tests demonstrated that 76% of adult and 72% of the elderly vaccinees possessed protective levels of antibody(HI titres of >40) to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains.

So far, there have been very few reports of influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus being detected in Asia. According to the UK Office for National Statistics, the number of deaths from all causes is about average for this time of year in the past five years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta report that the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza in the USA is below the ""epidemic threshold"" for the time of year. An influenza A(H9N2) case was confirmed on 9 December 2003 by the Department of Health of Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China. This was a 5-year-old boy, hospitalized at the end of November with mild clinical symptoms and discharged 2 days later. It appears that this is an isolated case, with no evidence of further spread or of human-to-human transmission. Investigation continues. This is the second time that avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses have been isolated from humans in Hong Kong SAR.

Compared with the significant increase in previous weeks, influenza A(H3N2) activity seemed to be levelling off although, in several central and eastern European countries (Croatia, Latvia and Switzerland), it continued to increase. So far this season influenza B activity has been low and reported only from Asian countries (Republic of Korea and Thailand). Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized so far have been A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the others have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. Following last week’s update on the A(H5N1) outbreak in the Republic of Korea, no more farms have been reported to be infected by avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. The National Influenza Centre in the Republic of Korea has finished sampling sera from persons in contact with suspect infected animals and nearby residents, and will start serological studies shortly. Avian influenza virus A(H5N1) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of avian influenza in two southern provinces of Viet Nam; there is also information on outbreaks of avian influenza in other provinces. The virus, which spreads rapidly and has a mortality approaching 100% in chickens, has resulted in the deaths of 40 000 chickens and the culling of 30 000 more. Pigs and ducks are also reported to have been infected. Since the end of October 2003, hospitals in Hanoi and surrounding provinces have admitted 14 persons with severe respiratory illness – 13 children and one adult (the mother of a deceased child). To date, 11 of the children and the adult have died. The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Viet Nam and the National Influenza Centre in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (Hong Kong SAR) confirmed that three of these cases were infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. At present, there is no evidence that human-to-human transmission is occurring, and no health care workers have been infected. More information is available on the WHO web site. Belgium. Influenza A(H3N2) activity declined in week 1 (28 December 2003 to 3 January 2004) in terms both of the number of viruses identified and of the influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate. Canada. In week 1, widespread influenza activity was reported in Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and some parts of British Columbia. Overall ILI consultation rate dropped from 79 cases per 1000 consultations in week 52 of 2003 to 36 cases per 1000. Of the 456 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 429 (94%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (6%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2).

"(' 1 September 2004 Health authorities in France have notified WHO of a recent case of rabies in a dog with multiple opportunities to transmit the disease to humans and other animals. WHO is issuing this alert to assist French authorities in tracing persons and their animals known or thought to have been in contact with the infected dog during the period when virus transmission is possible. The dog, accompanied by her owner was present at several public gatherings during a time when numerous tourists were visiting this part of France. On 26 August 2004, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France has confirmed that the dog was rabid. The dog, a four-month-old female, was acquired near Agadir, Morocco, in early July 2004 and illegally imported into France on 11 July 2004. The dog, which was neither registered nor vaccinated against rabies, showed initial clinical signs of illness on 18 August and died on 21 August. The dog is described as of medium size, with medium-length hair of a brown- apricot colour, black muzzle, long tail, and drooping ears. Transmission of rabies from this animal to humans and other animals could have occurred at any time from 2 August to 21 August. Several opportunities for exposure occurred. The dog’s owner, a resident of Bordeaux in the Gironde region, frequently took the dog for walks throughout the city, but most often in the neighbourhoods of Pont de Pierre, Bastide, quai de Queyries, the botanical gardens, and near the lake of Bordeaux. The owner also travelled with the dog to other parts of southwestern France as follows: – on 2 August to Hostens (Gironde region) – on 5 August to the Mimos Festival in Périgueux (Dordogne region) – from 7 to 8 August to a street theatre festival in Miramont de Guyenne (Lot and Garonne region) – from 12 to 14 August to the Fest’Art music festival in Libourne (Gironde region). Throughout the period from 2 to 21 August, the infected dog had several contacts with persons and dogs and is known to have bitten some persons. Several of these people have been identified and treated against rabies. French authorities are now urgently seeking any additional persons and animals who may have been in contact with this dog during the infectious period. In particular, the authorities are seeking: – a French-North African couple with two children (a boy and girl around the age of five) who played with the dog one night (date not known) after 21:00 in Bordeaux on the quai rive gauche; – a young lady speaking French with a Spanish accent who was walking near the lake of Bordeaux with her young daughter and a small white West Highland terrier dog on 10 or 11 August; – a cyclist, around 40 years old, who was chased by the dog on the docks of Garonne in front of the restaurant l’Estacade; – a couple, around 50 years old, who played with the dog near Lac Bleu in Léognan (Gironde). Persons fitting this description are asked urgently to telephone this emergency number in Gironde: (+33) 5 56 90 60 00. Persons who believe their dog may have been in contact with the infected animal, involving licking, sniffing, playing, scratching, or bites, should contact a local veterinary service for an assessment of the risk. Rabies, a viral disease, is invariably fatal in infected humans and animals. Vaccine administered shortly after exposure and immunoglobulin when required can prevent development of the disease.

"(' 8 April 2005 As of 7 April, 205 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these, 180 have died. Zaire Province has reported its first 6 cases, bringing the number of affected provinces to seven, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country. Mobile surveillance teams in Uige were forced to suspend operations yesterday when vehicles were attacked and damaged by local residents. As the situation has not improved, no surveillance teams were operational today in this province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak. WHO staff in Uige were notified today of several fatalities but teams were unable to investigate the cause of death or collect the bodies for safe burial. Discussions have been held with provincial authorities to find urgent solutions. The dramatic symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and its frequent fatality are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by a lack of public understanding of the disease. Moreover, because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded. WHO is familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Two medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the public about the disease. In African countries, the single most important factor in controlling viral haemorrhagic fevers is the engagement of affected communities as partners in control. To achieve this engagement, local belief systems about the causes of disease and traditional rituals for mourning the dead must be respected. When the public understands and accepts a few simple messages – avoid contact with blood and other fluids when caring for the ill, don’t touch bodies of the deceased – transmission within the community can be stopped and the outbreak brought under control. International appeal Specialized international staff and equipment have been deployed rapidly and measures are beginning to have an impact. Control of the outbreak will require intensified and sustained technical support from multidisciplinary teams, and additional materials and supplies. Provision of adequate personal protective equipment is a particularly urgent need. Increased field coordination of technical, operational and logistic support is likewise needed. Today, WHO has launched an appeal, through the United Nations, for funding to support the emergency response to this outbreak. WHO needs US$ 2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health, Angola to intensify ongoing operations in the field. To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, priority activities include intensive social mobilization and health education in the towns and villages of Uige Province. To reduce the risk of transmission in health care facilities, priorities include the provision of personal protective equipment for front-line staff and essential supplies for infection control, including disinfectants. Additional activities that urgently need to be strengthened include the early detection and isolation of cases and the tracing and follow up of contacts. ',)",3475
"(' 14 April 2005 As of 12 April, 235 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 215 have died. Uige Province remains the most severely affected area, reporting a cumulative total of 208 cases and 194 deaths. The isolation ward at the province’s large 400-bed hospital, which has been specially equipped and staffed for the care of Marburg patients, is empty, despite the fact that cases and deaths are known to be occurring in the community. It is apparent that, for the time being, the community does not accept the concept of isolation. Residents are unwilling to report suspected cases and allow these people to be managed under conditions that reduce the risk of further transmission. Measures such as patient isolation and infection control that reduce opportunities for further transmission are the principal tools for bringing the outbreak under control. Given the urgency of the situation, WHO may temporarily introduce, as an emergency measure, a harm reduction strategy aimed at making a dangerous situation somewhat better. Family members and other caregivers who refuse to allow patients to be cared for in the isolation facility are being informed of ways to protect themselves from infection and given appropriate supplies. WHO has placed urgent orders for disinfectants, which are currently in short supply in Angola. Today, international staff drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network began training sessions for staff at the provincial hospital in the use of equipment and supplies to reduce the risk of infection in the health care setting. This training, which has been very well received, will continue through Saturday. Fever-screening units are being established to ensure that all persons admitted to hospital are initially screened for symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever before being admitted to the general hospital wards. Apart from continuing security concerns, another pressing problem is poor access to remote communities in Uige Province and correspondingly poor surveillance for cases in these areas. With the assistance of a military helicopter, international staff have begun pre-positioning supplies and equipment needed for outbreak control in these areas so that a response can be launched immediately should cases begin to occur. In a tragic development, four Red Cross volunteers, freshly trained in social mobilization, were killed today by lightning while on their way to work. Support from Red Cross volunteers has been instrumental in controlling large outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

Infrastructures and protocols for controlling the outbreak are in place and functioning well. The isolation unit at Uige’s provincial hospital is being used, infection control in the hospital has improved, and safe burial practices are now being followed. Portable field laboratories continue to provide rapid diagnostic support. A campaign to stop home treatment of patients using unsafe injections has resulted in the collection and safe disposal of a large number of needles and syringes. The campaign, which has been supported by religious and community leaders and volunteers from the local Red Cross, is thought to have raised public awareness of the associated risks considerably. Support from religious and community leaders has also allowed the work of mobile surveillance teams to run more smoothly, increasing the efficiency of case finding and contact tracing. However, some new cases continue to be linked to exposure in homes and at funerals, indicating that public understanding of the disease still needs to be improved. As transmission of the virus requires close personal contact with an ill or recently deceased patient, the risk to international travellers to Angola is considered to be very low. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Angola. ',)",11

These are the first cases in this municipality detected since early April. An urgent investigation has been launched to determine whether the Bungo cases can be linked to Uige municipality, where transmission is known to be ongoing. Another focus of transmission would be a disturbing development for outbreak control. In Uige municipality, procedures for contact tracing are now operating with greater efficiency. This week, staff from the mobile surveillance teams were able to visit and look for signs of illness in more than half of the 100 persons known to have had close contact with a Marburg patient. New cases are, however, continuing to occur with no known link to a previous case, suggesting that the surveillance system has not yet reached the efficiency needed to interrupt chains of transmission. Local and international staff have continued to identify cultural practices that create opportunities for exposure to the virus and thus allow the outbreak to continue. Most recently, around 200 traditional healers have been trained in ways to reduce risks to themselves and their clients and given masks and gloves. To date, at least two traditional healers have died of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Intensive educational campaigns, supported by local religious leaders and Red Cross volunteers, about the hazards of home treatment using injections have resulted in the collection and safe disposal of large numbers of syringes.

Half the cases have been reported in the past ten days, with the first case occurring in early October. Two cases have been confirmed to have been caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and laboratory testing continues.

Only one is under five years old, three are between 7 and 13 and five are between 26 and 58. The outbreak is due to imported poliovirus. Congo had recorded its last case of indigenous polio in 2000. Investigations are ongoing to determine definitively the origins of the virus. Nearly all cases have been reported from the port city of Pointe Noire, with cases also reported from Dolisie (2), Kayes, Bouenza, Brazzaville, and Mvouiti (one each). The Government of Congo has alerted the public to the outbreak and launched an emergency response plan, with support from key partners, including WHO, UNICEF and the US CDC. At least three nationwide vaccination campaigns are expected, using monovalent oral polio vaccine and targeting the entire population. The number, geographic extent and target age groups of further campaigns will be determined by the Government based on the evolving epidemiology. It is anticipated that a multi-country campaign will be required to cover bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported every day. It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of Africa strengthen AFP surveillance, in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also strengthen population immunity levels to minimise the consequences of any virus introduction.

"("" 21 April 2011 - Côte d'Ivoire is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) with three new cases reported with onset of paralysis on 27 January, 24 February and 27 February this year. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses show that they are linked to WPV3 last detected in mid-2008 in northern Nigeria. They are the first WPV3 recorded in Côte d'Ivoire since 2000. In 2008-2009, Côte d'Ivoire was affected by a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting west Africa (and which was recently stopped). There is currently a high risk of further spread of WPV3 - both within and from - Côte d'Ivoire. It is the first time since 2000 that WPV3 has been recorded in this part of west Africa (WPV3 transmission has been limited to northern Nigeria and parts of Niger, and since 2008 also in parts of Mali and one case in Benin). The outbreak response may be constrained by the current security situation in Côte d'Ivoire. Due to the persistence of subnational surveillance gaps in Côte d'Ivoire and other areas of west Africa, undetected further circulation cannot be ruled out at this time. Detection of these WPV3 cases underscores the risk suboptimal surveillance poses to the global polio eradication effort. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at its lowest level in history, with only nine cases reported worldwide in 2011 - efforts to rapidly interrupt all remaining chains of WPV3 transmission is a key priority for the global polio eradication effort. The overriding priority is to urgently stop the WPV3 outbreak, while maintaining high population immunity across west Africa to WPV1. Two rounds of coordinated, multi-country supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) across west Africa have been/are being implemented on 25 March 2011, and again on 29 April 2011, in 15 countries across west Africa (except Côte d'Ivoire, see next paragraph). A further outbreak response is currently planned in six countries, over and beyond these two multi-country SIAs. Such a further response could see planned SIAs scheduled for the fourth quarter to be brought forward to earlier in the year. In Côte d'Ivoire, the end-March SIA did not take place due to the current security and political situation. A response round is proposed in the affected province using bOPV in late April 2011, to be followed by two National Immunization Days (NIDs), as soon as the situation permits. Planning is underway to ensure capacity (ie technical, vaccine, operational) is in place for this emergency response. Coordination with other United Nations (UN) organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Côte d'Ivoire is ongoing, to ensure that OPV is added to any planned immunization activity, in particular for displaced populations. Ongoing transmission will be monitored, and mop-ups implemented as epidemiology dictates.

"(' 8 October 2012 - As of 7 October 2012, 49 cases (31 laboratory confirmed, 18 probable) with Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Of these, 24 have been fatal (10 confirmed, 14 probable). The cases reported are from Isiro and Viadana health zones in Haut-Uélé district in Province Orientale. The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to work with partners, under the National Task Force to identify all possible chains of transmission of the illness and ensure that appropriate measures are taken to interrupt transmission and stop the outbreak. The task force includes Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF); the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); US Agency for International Development (USAID); US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and WHO. Response operations continue in the areas of coordination; Infection Prevention and Control (IPC); surveillance and epidemiology; case management; public information and social mobilization; psychosocial support; anthropological analysis; and logistics. WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed experts to support operational response, including establishment of a field laboratory and in the area of infection prevention and control in health care settings. Initial samples were tested and confirmed by Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). CDC established a field laboratory in Isiro in the beginning of the outbreak and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is continuing to provide support on rapid diagnosis in the field with their mobile laboratory facilities in Isiro. Ongoing activities in Isiro and neighbouring areas include: training of health care workers on IPC in health care facilities, provision of support on case management, strengthening surveillance, working with traditional healers in raising awareness about EHF, providing psychosocial support to affected families, and conducting outreach to schools. With respect to this event, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to be applied to the DRC. ### General information on controlling infection of EHF in health-care settings Human-to-human transmission of the Ebola virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids. Transmission to healthcare workers has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus need to apply infection control measures to avoid any exposure to the patient’s blood and body fluids and/or direct unprotected contact with the possibly contaminated environment. In addition, it is important that Standard Precautions, particularly hand hygiene, the use of gloves and other personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and other measures are applied to all patients in all health care settings at all times.
