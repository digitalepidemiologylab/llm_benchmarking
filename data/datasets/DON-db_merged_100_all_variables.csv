"("" 10 February 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported Outbreak amongst Wildlife in South Africa and Associated Human Cases A laboratory confirmed outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) amongst wild animals in and near the Kruger National Park in South Africa has been reported by the National Institute for Virology in Johannesburg ( a WHO Collaborating Centre for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers and Arboviruses). Three associated human cases have also been reported, all with a benign febrile illness. Towards the end of January, six pregnant buffalo were observed to abort, and, shortly after, 3 giraffes and 1 waterbuck were found dead without obvious signs of predator attack. Three veterinarians in contact with tissues from these animals developed an uncomplicated, febrile illness. Deaths among goat kids in adjacent areas have also been recorded. Virus has been detected in tissues from the buffalo fetuses, the waterbuck, a giraffe, and 1 veterinarian. A program of control measures has been instituted: local farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock, and public health information on appropriate precautions has been disseminated to those involved in the livestock industry. Mosquito control measures have been increased in tourist destinations. However, most human cases of RVF reported in the past from South Africa were acquired through contact with diseased animals and their tissues, rather than through mosquito bites, so the general public is not perceived to be at particular risk of contracting the illness. Large outbreaks of RVF occurred in South Africa's inland plateau in 1974-76, and a small outbreak was recorded in 1981 in a coastal area of KwaZulu-Natal, but no disease activity has been detected in the intervening period. Several consecutive years with high rainfall have favoured the explosion of the Aedes mosquito population which is the vector for the virus.

"("" 06 August 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported On 5 August, the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin provided WHO with more details concerning the man hospitalized with suspected haemorrhagic fever, after returning from a trip to Côte d'Ivoire. He left Germany on 17 July for Abidjan, then travelled to Bouaké to spend 2 weeks at a scientific research camp located in the Komoe National Park. He returned to Germany on 1 August. The patient did not show any symptoms until he reached his home, so the Institute has concluded that the risk of person-to-person transmission to other passengers is minimal. All those who are known to have had direct contacts with him (either during the trip or after his arrival in Berlin) are under surveillance by the health authorities.

"(' In response to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO in collaboration with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and other partners, has developed a comprehensive strategic response plan for points of entry. The aim of the plan is to avoid the spread of the disease to other provinces or at the international level. The plan includes mapping strategic points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and therefore are at risk of Ebola virus disease transmission based on population movement. The plan also includes implementing health measures at the identified points of entry/traveller congregation points, such as risk communication and community engagement, temperature checks, provision of hand hygiene and sanitation materials, and the development of alert, investigation and referral procedures. As of 18 May 2018, a total of 115 points of entry/traveller congregation points have been listed and mapped along cordon sanitaires in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, larger Equateur Province, and Kinshasa. Of these, some 30 points of entry have been prioritized for in-depth assessments and for implementing relevant prevention, detection and control measures. These include major ports and congregation points along the Congo river, as well as the two airports and the international port in Kinshasa. Areas of large gatherings such as markets are also being assessed. Along the Congo river there are many private smaller ports and points of congregation with a low volume of traffic. Proper screening cannot be conducted at all 115 points, and the efforts currently focus on the 30 prioritized points of entries/ traveller congregation points, as well as on risk communications activities and community engagement. Entry and exit screening measures have been implemented at the Mbandaka airport, as well as in some terminals of the Kinshasa international airport. These include travel health declaration, visual observation for symptoms, temperature check and travel health promotion measures, as well as procedures for referral of suspect cases. The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, was convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, and advised against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in relation to the current Ebola outbreak, as flight cancellations and other travel restrictions may hinder the international public health response and may cause significant economic damage to the affected country (see link below). The Emergency Committee also advised that exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance; however entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value. WHO is monitoring travel and trade measures in relation to the current outbreak. As of 28 May, 23 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but there are currently no restrictions of international traffic in place. ### WHO advice The Emergency Committee convened by the Director-General on 18 May 2018 noted that the Ebola outbreak does not currently meet the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee issued comprehensive Public Health Advice , in particular with regards to the fact that there should be no international travel or trade restrictions, that neighbouring countries should strengthen preparedness and surveillance, and that during the response, safety and security of staff should be ensured, and protection of responders of national and international staff should prioritised. WHO has also issued travel advice for international travellers in relation to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see link below). #### Travellers going through the exit screening from the Democratic Republic of the Congo Effective exit screening helps prevent the exportation and spread of disease to other areas. During exit screening at international airports and points of entry, travellers will be assessed for signs and symptoms of an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease, or identified as contacts potentially exposed to Ebola virus disease. * Travellers with a possible exposure to Ebola virus and who are sick should postpone international travel and seek immediate medical assistance if there is a possible exposure to Ebola virus disease; * Any person with an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation (see link below); * Travellers should plan to arrive early at the travel facility and expect delays related to public health screening; * Travellers will be required to complete a Traveller Public Health Declaration, and these will be reviewed prior to clearance to board; * Temperature measurement will be required, in addition to normal security provisions; * Boarding may be denied based on public health criteria. #### Travellers with symptoms on board a conveyance There is a possibility that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus and developed symptoms may board a commercial flight or other mode of transport, without informing the transport company of his/her status. Such travellers should seek immediate medical attention upon arrival, mention their recent travel history, and then be isolated to prevent further transmission. Information of close contacts of this person on board the aircraft (e.g. passengers one seat away from the ill traveller on the same flight, including across an aisle, and crew who report direct body contact with the ill traveller) should be obtained through collaboration with various stakeholders at points of entry (e.g. airline reservation system) in order to undergo contact tracing. #### Returning travellers The risk of a traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. Transmission requires direct contact with blood or fluids of infected persons or animals (alive or dead), all unlikely exposures for the average traveller (see link below). There is, however, a risk for health care workers and volunteers, especially if involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients. The risk can be considered low, unless adequate infection prevention and control measures (such as use of clean water and soap or alcohol-based hand rubs, personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and proper waste management) are not followed, including at points of medical care at ports, airports and ground crossings. As the incubation period for Ebola is between 2 to 21 days, travellers involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients or who suspect possible exposure to Ebola virus in the affected areas, should take the following precautions for 21 days after returning: * Stay within reach of a good quality health care facility; * Be aware of the symptoms of infection; and, * Seek immediate medical attention (e.g. through hotline telephone numbers) and mention their recent travel history if they develop Ebola virus disease like symptoms.

The Committee issued\ncomprehensive Public Health Advice , in particular with regards to the fact\nthat there should be no international travel or trade restrictions, that\nneighbouring countries should strengthen preparedness and surveillance, and\nthat during the response, safety and security of staff should be ensured, and\nprotection of responders of national and international staff should\nprioritised.\n\nWHO has also issued travel advice for international travellers in relation to\nthe current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see link\nbelow).\n\n#### Travellers going through the exit screening from the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo\n\nEffective exit screening helps prevent the exportation and spread of disease\nto other areas. During exit screening at international airports and points of\nentry, travellers will be assessed for signs and symptoms of an illness\nconsistent with Ebola virus disease, or identified as contacts potentially\nexposed to Ebola virus disease.\n\n  * Travellers with a possible exposure to Ebola virus and who are sick should postpone international travel and seek immediate medical assistance if there is a possible exposure to Ebola virus disease;\n  * Any person with an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation (see link below);\n  * Travellers should plan to arrive early at the travel facility and expect delays related to public health screening;\n  * Travellers will be required to complete a Traveller Public Health Declaration, and these will be reviewed prior to clearance to board;\n  * Temperature measurement will be required, in addition to normal security provisions;\n  * Boarding may be denied based on public health criteria.\n\n#### Travellers with symptoms on board a conveyance\n\nThere is a possibility that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus and\ndeveloped symptoms may board a commercial flight or other mode of transport,\nwithout informing the transport company of his/her status. Such travellers\nshould seek immediate medical attention upon arrival, mention their recent\ntravel history, and then be isolated to prevent further transmission.\nInformation of close contacts of this person on board the aircraft (e.g.\npassengers one seat away from the ill traveller on the same flight, including\nacross an aisle, and crew who report direct body contact with the ill\ntraveller) should be obtained through collaboration with various stakeholders\nat points of entry (e.g. airline reservation system) in order to undergo\ncontact tracing.\n\n#### Returning travellers\n\nThe risk of a traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to\nthe affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low,\neven if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been\nreported. Transmission requires direct contact with blood or fluids of\ninfected persons or animals (alive or dead), all unlikely exposures for the\naverage traveller (see link below).\n\nThere is, however, a risk for health care workers and volunteers, especially\nif involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients. The risk can be\nconsidered low, unless adequate infection prevention and control measures\n(such as use of clean water and soap or alcohol-based hand rubs, personal\nprotective equipment, safe injection practices and proper waste management)\nare not followed, including at points of medical care at ports, airports and\nground crossings.\n\nAs the incubation period for Ebola is between 2 to 21 days, travellers\ninvolved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients or who suspect possible\nexposure to Ebola virus in the affected areas, should take the following\nprecautions for 21 days after returning:\n\n  * Stay within reach of a good quality health care facility;\n  * Be aware of the symptoms of infection; and,\n  * Seek immediate medical attention (e.g. through hotline telephone numbers) and mention their recent travel history if they develop Ebola virus disease like symptoms.\n\n',)",7721,"(' In response to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO in collaboration with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and other partners, has developed a comprehensive strategic response plan for points of entry. The aim of the plan is to avoid the spread of the disease to other provinces or at the international level. The plan includes mapping strategic points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and therefore are at risk of Ebola virus disease transmission based on population movement. The plan also includes implementing health measures at the identified points of entry/traveller congregation points, such as risk communication and community engagement, temperature checks, provision of hand hygiene and sanitation materials, and the development of alert, investigation and referral procedures. As of 18 May 2018, a total of 115 points of entry/traveller congregation points have been listed and mapped along cordon sanitaires in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, larger Equateur Province, and Kinshasa. Of these, some 30 points of entry have been prioritized for in-depth assessments and for implementing relevant prevention, detection and control measures. These include major ports and congregation points along the Congo river, as well as the two airports and the international port in Kinshasa. Areas of large gatherings such as markets are also being assessed. Along the Congo river there are many private smaller ports and points of congregation with a low volume of traffic.

The Committee issued comprehensive Public Health Advice , in particular with regards to the fact that there should be no international travel or trade restrictions, that neighbouring countries should strengthen preparedness and surveillance, and that during the response, safety and security of staff should be ensured, and protection of responders of national and international staff should prioritised. WHO has also issued travel advice for international travellers in relation to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see link below). #### Travellers going through the exit screening from the Democratic Republic of the Congo Effective exit screening helps prevent the exportation and spread of disease to other areas. During exit screening at international airports and points of entry, travellers will be assessed for signs and symptoms of an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease, or identified as contacts potentially exposed to Ebola virus disease. * Travellers with a possible exposure to Ebola virus and who are sick should postpone international travel and seek immediate medical assistance if there is a possible exposure to Ebola virus disease; * Any person with an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation (see link below); * Travellers should plan to arrive early at the travel facility and expect delays related to public health screening; * Travellers will be required to complete a Traveller Public Health Declaration, and these will be reviewed prior to clearance to board; * Temperature measurement will be required, in addition to normal security provisions; * Boarding may be denied based on public health criteria. #### Travellers with symptoms on board a conveyance There is a possibility that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus and developed symptoms may board a commercial flight or other mode of transport, without informing the transport company of his/her status. Such travellers should seek immediate medical attention upon arrival, mention their recent travel history, and then be isolated to prevent further transmission. Information of close contacts of this person on board the aircraft (e.g. passengers one seat away from the ill traveller on the same flight, including across an aisle, and crew who report direct body contact with the ill traveller) should be obtained through collaboration with various stakeholders at points of entry (e.g. airline reservation system) in order to undergo contact tracing. #### Returning travellers The risk of a traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. Transmission requires direct contact with blood or fluids of infected persons or animals (alive or dead), all unlikely exposures for the average traveller (see link below). There is, however, a risk for health care workers and volunteers, especially if involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients. The risk can be considered low, unless adequate infection prevention and control measures (such as use of clean water and soap or alcohol-based hand rubs, personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and proper waste management) are not followed, including at points of medical care at ports, airports and ground crossings. As the incubation period for Ebola is between 2 to 21 days, travellers involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients or who suspect possible exposure to Ebola virus in the affected areas, should take the following precautions for 21 days after returning: * Stay within reach of a good quality health care facility; * Be aware of the symptoms of infection; and, * Seek immediate medical attention (e.g. through hotline telephone numbers) and mention their recent travel history if they develop Ebola virus disease like symptoms.

"(' 1 September 2004 Health authorities in France have notified WHO of a recent case of rabies in a dog with multiple opportunities to transmit the disease to humans and other animals. WHO is issuing this alert to assist French authorities in tracing persons and their animals known or thought to have been in contact with the infected dog during the period when virus transmission is possible. The dog, accompanied by her owner was present at several public gatherings during a time when numerous tourists were visiting this part of France. On 26 August 2004, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France has confirmed that the dog was rabid. The dog, a four-month-old female, was acquired near Agadir, Morocco, in early July 2004 and illegally imported into France on 11 July 2004. The dog, which was neither registered nor vaccinated against rabies, showed initial clinical signs of illness on 18 August and died on 21 August. The dog is described as of medium size, with medium-length hair of a brown- apricot colour, black muzzle, long tail, and drooping ears. Transmission of rabies from this animal to humans and other animals could have occurred at any time from 2 August to 21 August. Several opportunities for exposure occurred. The dog’s owner, a resident of Bordeaux in the Gironde region, frequently took the dog for walks throughout the city, but most often in the neighbourhoods of Pont de Pierre, Bastide, quai de Queyries, the botanical gardens, and near the lake of Bordeaux. The owner also travelled with the dog to other parts of southwestern France as follows: – on 2 August to Hostens (Gironde region) – on 5 August to the Mimos Festival in Périgueux (Dordogne region) – from 7 to 8 August to a street theatre festival in Miramont de Guyenne (Lot and Garonne region) – from 12 to 14 August to the Fest’Art music festival in Libourne (Gironde region). Throughout the period from 2 to 21 August, the infected dog had several contacts with persons and dogs and is known to have bitten some persons. Several of these people have been identified and treated against rabies. French authorities are now urgently seeking any additional persons and animals who may have been in contact with this dog during the infectious period. In particular, the authorities are seeking: – a French-North African couple with two children (a boy and girl around the age of five) who played with the dog one night (date not known) after 21:00 in Bordeaux on the quai rive gauche; – a young lady speaking French with a Spanish accent who was walking near the lake of Bordeaux with her young daughter and a small white West Highland terrier dog on 10 or 11 August; – a cyclist, around 40 years old, who was chased by the dog on the docks of Garonne in front of the restaurant l’Estacade; – a couple, around 50 years old, who played with the dog near Lac Bleu in Léognan (Gironde). Persons fitting this description are asked urgently to telephone this emergency number in Gironde: (+33) 5 56 90 60 00. Persons who believe their dog may have been in contact with the infected animal, involving licking, sniffing, playing, scratching, or bites, should contact a local veterinary service for an assessment of the risk. Rabies, a viral disease, is invariably fatal in infected humans and animals. Vaccine administered shortly after exposure and immunoglobulin when required can prevent development of the disease. Rabies can be transmitted throughout the period of infectivity via saliva, bites, scratches, or licking. ### For more information ',)",3082,4,2004-02-18a,"Avian influenza A(H5N1) - update 26:Situation (human) in Thailand and VietNam, Situation (poultry) in Asia",2/18/2004,https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2004_02_18-en/,Influenza A,H5N1,Vietnam,VNM,NA,22,NA,NA,NA,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,2004,2,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,2004,2,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2004_02_18-en,DON-2004-02-18-a,2004-02-18a,"(""\n\n  * Global\n  * Regions\n\nWHO Regional websites\n\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\nWhen autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and\nenter to select.\n\nSelect language  Select language English العربية 中文 Français Русский Español\nPortuguês\n\n  * Home\n\n  * Health Topics\n\n  * All topics »\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Resources »\n    * Fact sheets\n    * Facts in pictures\n    * Multimedia\n    * Publications\n    * Questions & answers\n    * Tools and toolkits\n\n  * Popular »\n    * Air pollution\n    * Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n    * Hepatitis\n    * Monkeypox\n\n  * Countries\n\n  * All countries\xa0»\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Regions »\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\n  * WHO in countries »\n    * Statistics\n    * Cooperation strategies\n    * Ukraine emergency\n\n  * Newsroom\n\n  * All news »\n    * News releases\n    * Statements\n    * Campaigns\n    * Commentaries\n    * Events\n    * Feature stories\n    * Speeches\n    * Spotlights\n    * Newsletters\n    * Photo library\n    * Media distribution list\n\n  * Headlines\xa0»\n\n  * Emergencies\n\n  * Focus on »\n    * Afghanistan crisis\n    * COVID-19 pandemic\n    * Northern Ethiopia crisis\n    * Syria crisis\n    * Ukraine emergency\n    * Monkeypox outbreak\n    * Greater Horn of Africa crisis\n\n  * Latest »\n    * Disease Outbreak News\n    * Travel advice\n    * Situation reports\n    * Weekly Epidemiological Record\n\n  * WHO in emergencies »\n    * Surveillance\n    * Research\n    * Funding\n    * Partners\n    * Operations\n    * Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee\n    * WHO's Health Emergency Appeal 2023\n\n  * Data\n\n  * Data at WHO »\n    * Global Health Estimates\n    * Health SDGs\n    * Mortality Database\n    * Data collections\n\n  * Dashboards »\n    * COVID-19 Dashboard\n    * Triple Billion Dashboard\n    * Health Inequality Monitor\n\n  * Highlights »\n    * Global Health Observatory\n    * SCORE\n    * Insights and visualizations\n    * Data collection tools\n\n  * Reports »\n    * World Health Statistics 2022\n    * COVID excess deaths\n    * DDI IN FOCUS: 2022\n\n  * About WHO\n\n  * About WHO »\n    * People\n    * Teams\n    * Structure\n    * Partnerships and collaboration\n    * Collaborating centres\n    * Networks, committees and advisory groups\n    * Transformation\n\n  * Our Work »\n    * General Programme of Work\n    * WHO Academy\n    * Activities\n    * Initiatives\n\n  * Funding »\n    * Investment case\n    * WHO Foundation\n\n  * Accountability »\n    * Audit\n    * Programme Budget\n    * Financial statements\n    * Programme Budget Portal\n    * Results Report\n\n  * Governance »\n    * World Health Assembly\n    * Executive Board\n    * Election of Director-General\n    * Governing Bodies website\n    * Member States Portal\n\n  * Home/\n  * Disease Outbreak News/\n  * Item/\n  * Recent outbreaks of cholera in Africa\n\n#  2004 - Mozambique\n\n18 February 2004\n\n18 February 2004\n\nBurundi\n\nSince the beginning of December 2003 there have been several clusters of\ncholera cases.

"(' On 5 February 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 28 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, including five deaths. Onset dates ranged from 21 December 2015 to 25 January 2016. Cases ranged in age from 14 to 91 years, with a median age of 58 years. Of these 28 cases, 18 (64%) were male. The majority (25 cases, 89%) reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; the exposure history of three cases is unknown or no clear exposure to poultry. No clusters were reported. Cases were reported from six provinces and municipalities: Zhejiang (13), Jiangsu (5), Guangdong (4), Fujian (3), Shanghai (2) and Hunan (1). See attachment for individual case information. Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document (see related links). ### Public health response The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: * strengthening outbreak surveillance and situation analysis; * reinforcing all efforts on medical treatment; and * conducting risk communication with the public and dissemination of information. ### WHO risk assessment WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Based on the information received thus far, the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed. If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly in the neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travels or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans. ### WHO advice WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

"("" 28 October 2010 - As of 27 October, the Ministry of Health in Haiti (MSPP) reported 4 722 cholera cases including 303 deaths. The departments reporting confirmed cases are Artibonte (76.5%), Central (22.9%), Nord-Est, and Nord. Priorities of the Government of Haiti's National Response Strategy to the Cholera Epidemic are to protect families at the community level, to strengthen primary health care centers already operating across the nation, and to establish a network of Cholera Treatment Centers and designated hospitals for treatment of severe cases. The strains of Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa isolated in Haiti and tested by the National Public Health Laboratory (LNSP) and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed resistance to the following antibiotics: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, furazolidone, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin. The strains are sensitive to tetracycline, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. Full genetic sequencing of the strains is ongoing. #### PAHO/WHO Response Relief efforts continue as the government, MINUSTAH (The UN Stabilization Force in Haiti), UN agencies and NGOs continue to provide assistance in a growing number of locations. PAHO coordinates these efforts with other UN agencies, and with health officials in WHO Member States from the Region and beyond. PAHO continues to mobilize international experts in the areas of epidemiology, risk communication, case management, laboratory, water and sanitation, logistics, and LSS/SUMA (humanitarian supply management system) to Haiti and also to the Dominican Republic. Additional medical supplies including 50, 000 intravenous fluids (Ringer’s Lactate), and 10 diarrhoeal disease treatment kits sufficient to treat 400-500 severe cholera cases have been purchased with funding from the international corporation, expected to arrive shortly in Haiti. PAHO and US CDC experts are working together on improved surveillance and reporting of cases, analysis of water samples from rivers and other water sources, and monitoring of antibiotic resistance. To support the Haitian Ministry of Health's planning efforts and the contingency planning for the Dominican Republic, PAHO is working with the US CDC to develop modelling scenarios to project the dynamics and likely spread of the outbreak . However, even with the best modelling efforts, it will not be possible to accurately predict the course of the epidemic. WHO does not recommend any restrictions in travel and trade between countries or between different regions of a country experiencing cholera outbreaks. Travellers do not require proof of cholera vaccination, nor is there a need to screen travelers by means of rectal swabbing or faecal analysis. There is no need to establish quarantine measures at the border, a measure that diverts resources and may hamper cooperation between institutions and countries. ### FOR MORE INFORMATION "",)",1810,9,2010-10-28,Cholera in Haiti - update,10/28/2010,https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2010_10_28-en/,Cholera,NA,Haiti,HTI,"Artibonte, Central, Nord-Est, Nord",4722,NA,NA,NA,303,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,2010,10,27,yes,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2010_10_28-en,DON-2010-10-28,2010-10-28,"(""\n\n  * Global\n  * Regions\n\nWHO Regional websites\n\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\nWhen autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and\nenter to select.\n\nSelect language  Select language English العربية 中文 Français Русский Español\nPortuguês\n\n  * Home\n\n  * Health Topics\n\n  * All topics »\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Resources »\n    * Fact sheets\n    * Facts in pictures\n    * Multimedia\n    * Publications\n    * Questions & answers\n    * Tools and toolkits\n\n  * Popular »\n    * Air pollution\n    * Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n    * Hepatitis\n    * Monkeypox\n\n  * Countries\n\n  * All countries\xa0»\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Regions »\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\n  * WHO in countries »\n    * Statistics\n    * Cooperation strategies\n    * Ukraine emergency\n\n  * Newsroom\n\n  * All news »\n    * News releases\n    * Statements\n    * Campaigns\n    * Commentaries\n    * Events\n    * Feature stories\n    * Speeches\n    * Spotlights\n    * Newsletters\n    * Photo library\n    * Media distribution list\n\n  * Headlines\xa0»\n\n  * Emergencies\n\n  * Focus on »\n    * Afghanistan crisis\n    * COVID-19 pandemic\n    * Northern Ethiopia crisis\n    * Syria crisis\n    * Ukraine emergency\n    * Monkeypox outbreak\n    * Greater Horn of Africa crisis\n\n  * Latest »\n    * Disease Outbreak News\n    * Travel advice\n    * Situation reports\n    * Weekly Epidemiological Record\n\n  * WHO in emergencies »\n    * Surveillance\n    * Research\n    * Funding\n    * Partners\n    * Operations\n    * Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee\n    * WHO's Health Emergency Appeal 2023\n\n  * Data\n\n  * Data at WHO »\n    * Global Health Estimates\n    * Health SDGs\n    * Mortality Database\n    * Data collections\n\n  * Dashboards »\n    * COVID-19 Dashboard\n    * Triple Billion Dashboard\n    * Health Inequality Monitor\n\n  * Highlights »\n    * Global Health Observatory\n    * SCORE\n    * Insights and visualizations\n    * Data collection tools\n\n  * Reports »\n    * World Health Statistics 2022\n    * COVID excess deaths\n    * DDI IN FOCUS: 2022\n\n  * About WHO\n\n  * About WHO »\n    * People\n    * Teams\n    * Structure\n    * Partnerships and collaboration\n    * Collaborating centres\n    * Networks, committees and advisory groups\n    * Transformation\n\n  * Our Work »\n    * General Programme of Work\n    * WHO Academy\n    * Activities\n    * Initiatives\n\n  * Funding »\n    * Investment case\n    * WHO Foundation\n\n  * Accountability »\n    * Audit\n    * Programme Budget\n    * Financial statements\n    * Programme Budget Portal\n    * Results Report\n\n  * Governance »\n    * World Health Assembly\n    * Executive Board\n    * Election of Director-General\n    * Governing Bodies website\n    * Member States Portal\n\n  * Home/\n  * Disease Outbreak News/\n  * Item/\n  * Cholera in Haiti - update\n\n#  2010 - Haiti\n\n28 October 2010\n\n28 October 2010 - As of 27 October, the Ministry of Health in Haiti (MSPP)\nreported 4 722 cholera cases including 303 deaths.

"(' 29 September 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO 29 September 2000 CONTROL OF FIRST RIFT VALLEY FEVER OUTBREAK OUTSIDE AFRICA IS UNDER WAY WHO ASSISTS SAUDI ARABIA AND YEMEN The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners are responding to an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Saudi Arabia (Jizan Province) and an outbreak of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Yemen, (Wadi Mawr, Al- Hudaydah Governorate), which is suspected to be RVF. The first cases of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever were reported in the area on 10 and 11 September. Laboratory analysis at the United States\' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, confirmed a diagnosis of RVF in samples from Saudi Arabia. To date, 134 human cases of an acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome, including 31 deaths, have been reported in Yemen, while in Saudi Arabia there have been 160 suspected cases of RVF, including 33 human deaths. * providing expert advice to the governments concerned in disease confirmation, field investigation and implementation of control measures to contain the spread of the disease, * advising on how cases can be treated with the antiviral drug, ribavarin, * disseminating health education messages, and * putting in place measures to protect high risk groups, such as laboratory technicians and veterinarians. WHO, in conjunction with its international partners in the field, is: These are the first cases of Rift Valley Fever reported outside traditionally affected areas in Africa. It is important to establish whether this is a new introduction of the virus or whether, in fact, the pathogen has been present for some time and only now has come to the attention of public health authorities. Ecological studies are being carried out to determine the factors that may have triggered the outbreak. High-level agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen to conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of the international response to control the disease on both sides of the border. Saudi Arabia and Yemen are sharing useful information, including the investigation protocols, and there is good logistic coordination across the border. WHO Rift Valley Fever expert Dr Ray Arthur has played a key role investigating and responding to previous RVF outbreaks. ""I\'m working with both governments in the outbreak zone to facilitate coordination of the investigation and implement control procedures across the border,"" he stated. In Yemen, WHO and partners are assisting with the control of an acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome (suspected to be Rift Valley Fever). Laboratory studies are under way to confirm that the observed disease is in fact RVF. Earlier this week an Epidemic Committee comprised of all relevant Government Ministries in Yemen and a team of international experts, epidemiologists and laboratory technicians from WHO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United States\' NAMRU-3, a WHO Collaborating Centre in Cairo, began implementation of a joint plan of action to curb the spread of the outbreak. Dr Arthur plans to arrive in Saudi Arabia today and was replaced yesterday in Yemen by WHO epidemiologist Dr Douglas Klaucke, who will continue the advice and coordination function of WHO.

"(' Since the last Disease Outbreak News was published on 20 September (with data as of 15 September), an additional 4914 cases have been reported including 92 laboratory-confirmed cases. The cholera outbreak in Harare was declared by the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) of Zimbabwe on 6 September 2018 and notified to WHO on the same day. As of 3 October 2018, 8535 cumulative cases, including 163 laboratory-confirmed cases, and 50 deaths have been reported (case fatality rate: 0.6%). Of these 8535 cases, 98% (8341 cases) were reported from the densely populated capital Harare (Figure 1). The most affected suburbs in Harare are Glen View and Budiriro. Of the 8340 cases for which age is known, the majority (56%) are aged between 5 and 35 years old. Males and females have been equally affected by the outbreak. From 4 September through 3 October, the majority of deaths were reported from health care institutions. The pathogen is known to be Vibrio cholera O1 serotype Ogawa. Since confirmation on 6 September 2018, a multi-drug resistant strain has been identified and is in circulation; however, this does not affect the treatment of most cases, where supportive care such as rehydration solutions are used. Antibiotics are only recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, the antibiotic which is being used for severe cases in Harare is Azithromycin which remains effective in the majority of cases. Contaminated water sources, including wells and boreholes are suspected as the source of the outbreak. #### Figure 1: Cholera cases in Harare, Zimbabwe from 4 September through 3 October 2018 #### Figure 2: Cholera cases in Zimbabwe from 4 September through 1 October 2018 ### Public health response * On 3 October 2018, an oral cholera vaccine mass vaccination campaign started in Harare City and surrounding areas such as Chitungwiza and Epworth. WHO is supporting the MoHCC on a strategy for rolling out the vaccination campaign, as well as implementing the campaign and sensitizing the public about the vaccine. More than 600 health workers have been trained to carry out the campaign. On 27 September 2018, 500 000 doses have arrived in Harare. In total, 2.7 million doses have been approved for two rounds of vaccination. * WHO and experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are providing technical oversight into case management and providing guidance on the interpretation of laboratory findings to guide the choice of antibiotics. * Four cholera treatment centres (CTCs) have been established. UNICEF has prepositioned seven tents at Glenview for the CTC and Oxfam is providing mobile toilets in three CTCs. * The key risk communication and community engagement interventions have been on raising awareness on cholera prevention through the mass media and social media, and working with specific community groups, including Apostolic sect leaders and Apostolic women’s groups. * Sixty volunteers have been deployed to provide risk communication, community engagement and social mobilization support to CTCs in Budiriro and Glen View. Health and hygiene promotion is taking place through drama shows at schools and business centres, roadshows and door-to-door visits, which also focuses on identification and case referral. * Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities include enforcement of regulations for food vendors, City of Harare fixing burst water pipes and increasing the water supply to hotspots, with private sector players supporting installation of water tanks and water trucking. * UNICEF is supporting distribution of non-food items (soap, buckets), along with Oxfam, Christian Care, Mercy Corps and Welthungerhilfe (WHH), as well as key components of community mobilization. * WHO has sent supplies to treat 3800 people and arrangements are in place for additional supplies to arrive in the coming days. In addition, more than 44 000 litres of ringers lactate from South Africa have arrived in country and the RDTs are being cleared from the airport. * Since the cholera outbreak was declared on 6 September 2018, weekly meetings of the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee on Health (IACCH) have been held. * On 12 September 2018, following the declaration of the cholera outbreak as a state of disaster, the Cabinet Committee on Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Management was reactivated. * On 18 September 2018, the national government set up an inter-ministerial committee on the cholera outbreak, involving all major government stakeholders, to provide leadership and to monitor the cholera response efforts and provide regular briefs to the President. * On 21 September 2018, the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated, with support provided by local business organizations. The Incident Command Structure (ICS) was finalized and will be published by the EOC. * On 1 October 2018, Econet began fixing Information and Communications Technology equipment in the EOC in MoHCC of Zimbabwe to support real time reporting. * On 29 September 2018, a rapid assessment of surveillance was conducted in coordination with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC). ### WHO risk assessment The outbreak started on 5 September and the number of cases notified per day continues to rapidly increase, particularly in Glen View and Budiriro suburbs of Harare. Cases with epidemiological links to this outbreak have been reported from other provinces across the country. Glen View, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, is an active informal trading area where people come from across the city and the rest of the country to trade. Key risk factors for cholera in Zimbabwe include the deterioration of sanitary and health infrastructure and increasing rural-urban migration which further strains the water and sanitation infrastructure. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 135 cases have been reported from provinces outside Harare. With the upcoming rainy season in November, there is a concern that cases may increase in the hotspots. In Harare, contaminated water from boreholes and wells is suspected to be the source of the outbreak. Sixty-nine percent of the population in Harare relies on these boreholes and wells as a source of water. The water supply situation in Harare remains dire due to the high demand of water that is not being met by the city supply though this is a focus of response efforts. The country’s available response capacities are overstretched as authorities are already responding to a large typhoid outbreak which started in August 2018. WHO assessed the overall public health risk to be high at the national level and moderate at the regional and low at global levels. ### WHO advice WHO recommends proper and timely case management in CTCs. Increasing access to potable water, improving sanitation infrastructure, and strengthening hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities are the most effective means to prevent and control cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to the affected population. WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Zimbabwe based on the information currently available in relation to this outbreak.

Cases with epidemiological links to this outbreak have been\nreported from other provinces across the country. Glen View, which is the\nepicentre of the outbreak, is an active informal trading area where people\ncome from across the city and the rest of the country to trade. Key risk\nfactors for cholera in Zimbabwe include the deterioration of sanitary and\nhealth infrastructure and increasing rural-urban migration which further\nstrains the water and sanitation infrastructure. Since the beginning of the\noutbreak, 135 cases have been reported from provinces outside Harare. With the\nupcoming rainy season in November, there is a concern that cases may increase\nin the hotspots. In Harare, contaminated water from boreholes and wells is\nsuspected to be the source of the outbreak. Sixty-nine percent of the\npopulation in Harare relies on these boreholes and wells as a source of water.\nThe water supply situation in Harare remains dire due to the high demand of\nwater that is not being met by the city supply though this is a focus of\nresponse efforts. The country’s available response capacities are\noverstretched as authorities are already responding to a large typhoid\noutbreak which started in August 2018. WHO assessed the overall public health\nrisk to be high at the national level and moderate at the regional and low at\nglobal levels.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nWHO recommends proper and timely case management in CTCs. Increasing access to\npotable water, improving sanitation infrastructure, and strengthening hygiene\nand food safety practices in affected communities are the most effective means\nto prevent and control cholera. Key public health communication messages\nshould be provided to the affected population.\n\nWHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Zimbabwe\nbased on the information currently available in relation to this outbreak.\n\nFor further information, please refer to:\n\n',)",7453,"(' Since the last Disease Outbreak News was published on 20 September (with data as of 15 September), an additional 4914 cases have been reported including 92 laboratory-confirmed cases. The cholera outbreak in Harare was declared by the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) of Zimbabwe on 6 September 2018 and notified to WHO on the same day. As of 3 October 2018, 8535 cumulative cases, including 163 laboratory-confirmed cases, and 50 deaths have been reported (case fatality rate: 0.6%). Of these 8535 cases, 98% (8341 cases) were reported from the densely populated capital Harare (Figure 1). The most affected suburbs in Harare are Glen View and Budiriro. Of the 8340 cases for which age is known, the majority (56%) are aged between 5 and 35 years old. Males and females have been equally affected by the outbreak. From 4 September through 3 October, the majority of deaths were reported from health care institutions. The pathogen is known to be Vibrio cholera O1 serotype Ogawa. Since confirmation on 6 September 2018, a multi-drug resistant strain has been identified and is in circulation; however, this does not affect the treatment of most cases, where supportive care such as rehydration solutions are used. Antibiotics are only recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, the antibiotic which is being used for severe cases in Harare is Azithromycin which remains effective in the majority of cases. Contaminated water sources, including wells and boreholes are suspected as the source of the outbreak. #### Figure 1: Cholera cases in Harare, Zimbabwe from 4 September through 3 October 2018 #### Figure 2: Cholera cases in Zimbabwe from 4 September through 1 October 2018 ### Public health response * On 3 October 2018, an oral cholera vaccine mass vaccination campaign started in Harare City and surrounding areas such as Chitungwiza and Epworth. WHO is supporting the MoHCC on a strategy for rolling out the vaccination campaign, as well as implementing the campaign and sensitizing the public about the vaccine. More than 600 health workers have been trained to carry out the campaign. On 27 September 2018, 500 000 doses have arrived in Harare.

A total of three laboratory-confirmed cases, including two deaths, have been detected by yellow fever surveillance, with the clinical syndrome of fever and jaundice. The index case, reported from the Kassena-Nankana-West district, was a 12 year-old male who had been going with his father to his farm in a forest bordering Burkina Faso. Onset of symptoms occurred on 11 October 2011 and progressively got worse until he died in Sandema Hospital on 18 October 2011. District outbreak teams investigated the affected areas but found no additional cases. A reactive campaign has been planned starting 6 February 2012, supported by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF- ICG) and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). Over 235 000 people in the affected districts have been targeted for vaccination, with the exclusion of pregnant women and children aged under one year.

"(' Between 27 and 30 October 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 12 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 3 deaths. ### Details of the cases are as follows: The cases are from Riyadh (5), Taif (4), Hafr Albatin (1), Jouf (1) and Makkah (1). The median age of the patients is 56 years old (ranging from 30 to 90 years old). Eight cases (67%) are men and 8 (67%) are Saudi nationals. Eleven cases (92%) suffer from 1 or more comorbidities. In the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms, none of the cases performed Umrah/Hajj nor travelled out of their cities of residence. Only 1 case (8%) has a history of contact with animals and of raw camel products consumption. Seven cases (67%) – 2 of which were healthcare professionals – came in contact with MERS-CoV patients. Two cases (17%) – including 1 healthcare worker – spent time at hospitals with ongoing MERS-CoV outbreaks, although they had no contact with infected patients. Tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. The National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 MERS-CoV cases that were reported between 7 and 24 October 2014. Globally, WHO has been notified of 909 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 331 related deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

"(' 22 June 2013 - The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has announced an additional four laboratory-confirmed cases with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The first case is a 43 year-old female in the Eastern Region who has recovered. The other three cases are female health care workers aged 29, 39 and 45 from Taif governorate who cared for two previously confirmed MERS-CoV cases and were detected as part of the outbreak investigation and contact tracing. Two of these three cases were asymptomatic and all three tested weakly positive by PCR. Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 68 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 38 deaths. WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients’ lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised. Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

"(' 12 March 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO 12 March 2003 ### WHO issues a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia Cases of severe respiratory illness may spread to hospital staff 12 March 2003 | GENEVA -- Since mid February, WHO has been actively working to confirm reports of outbreaks of a severe form of pneumonia in Viet Nam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China, and Guangdong province in China. In Viet Nam the outbreak began with a single initial case who was hospitalized for treatment of severe, acute respiratory syndrome of unknown origin. He felt unwell during his journey and fell ill shortly after arrival in Hanoi from Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR, China. Following his admission to the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar symptoms. The signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore throat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings may include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white blood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral pneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering but some patients remain critically ill. Today, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an outbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight 11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were found to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for observation as a precautionary measure. In this group, eight have developed early chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. Three other health care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and two of them have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Investigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The Hospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the spread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between these cases and the outbreak in Hanoi. In mid February, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of atypical pneumonia, with five deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In two cases that died, chlamydia infection was found. Further investigations of the cause of the outbreak is ongoing. Overall the outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong SAR appear to be confined to the hospital environment. Those at highest risk appear to be staff caring for the patients. No link has so far been made between these outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in Hanoi and Hong Kong and the outbreak of `bird flu,` A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR reported on 19 February. Further investigations continue and laboratory tests on specimens from Viet Nam and Hong Kong SAR are being studied by WHO collaborating centres in Japan and the United States. Until more is known about the cause of these outbreaks, WHO recommends patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be isolated with barrier nursing techniques. At the same time, WHO recommends that any suspect cases be reported to national health authorities.

"(' Between 14 and 15 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Points (NFP) for Guyana, Barbados and Ecuador notified PAHO/WHO of cases of Zika virus infection. ### Guyana On 14 January, the NFP for Guyana reported the first laboratory-confirmed case of locally-acquired Zika virus infection in the country. The case is a 27-year-old female from Berbice, Region 6, with onset of symptoms on 1 January. Samples of the patient were collected on 4 January and sent to the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) laboratory in Trinidad and Tobago for testing. The case was confirmed by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) (viral genome detection). ### Barbados On 15 January, the NFP for Barbados reported the first 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of locally-acquired Zika virus infection in the country. None of the cases had a history of travel. Samples of the patients were sent to the CARPHA laboratory for testing. The cases were confirmed by PCR (viral genome detection). ### Ecuador On 15 January, the NFP for Ecuador reported 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of locally-acquired Zika virus infection in the country. As of 16 January, a total number of 6 cases had been reported – 2 of the cases were locally- acquired while the remaining 4 cases were imported (3 from Colombia and 1 from Venezuela). Samples from all cases were collected and sent to the National Public Health and Research Institute in Guayaquil for laboratory testing. All cases tested positive by PCR (viral genome detection) for Zika virus and negative for dengue and chikungunya. ### Public health response Health authorities in Guyana, Barbados and Ecuador are taking the following measures: * intensifying surveillance activities, * implementing vector control measures, * educating the public about the risks associated with Zika virus and encouraging them to take every precaution against mosquito bites. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women.

"(' 22 May 2003 Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8046 probable SARS cases and 682 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. These figures represent an increase of 95 new cases and 16 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SA (3), Taiwan (8), and Singapore (1). The cumulative total of probable cases surpassed 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May. Situation in Taiwan Taiwan authorities have today reported a record 60 new probable cases of SARS and 8 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 483 cases and 60 deaths. However, the large daily increases in new cases seen over the past week are due to a backlog in the investigation of pending cases and determination of which fit the case definition for probable SARS. While the daily numbers of new cases indicate the size of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, which is worrisome, they do not suggest an explosive escalation in the number of cases, as both older and new cases are being reported together on a daily basis. At present, the daily increases reflect a change in the way records have been kept, with cases in a “pending” category now being classified as either suspect or probable cases. As the backlog of pending cases is now being rapidly cleared, the daily reports should begin within days to give a more accurate picture of the evolution of the outbreak in Taiwan. Since detection of its first suspect cases, Taiwan has promptly reported on the outbreak to WHO. The first two cases, who were hospitalized on 8 March, occurred in a man with a recent travel history to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, and his wife, who had no recent travel history. The cases were officially recognized as suspect SARS cases on 14 March, two days after WHO issued a global alert about the emergence of a new disease with severe respiratory symptoms. A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, organized by WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, arrived in Taiwan on 16 March. Taiwan initially experienced a gradual increase in the number of cases. As of 18 April, 29 cases had been reported. All were identified, through contact tracing and investigation of travel history, as either imported cases, cases in persons with a recent travel history to areas with local transmission, and family members and other close contacts of patients. The number of cases began to climb at the end of April, when local transmission in hospitals became the source of the majority of new infections. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and now stands at 483. Taiwan has now received supplementary protective equipment shipped urgently from Thailand yesterday. The problem of infection control in hospitals is being addressed as a top priority. Procedures were set up today to ensure rapid and efficient distribution of the new equipment. WHO will be sending an additional 2 staff from Geneva to Taiwan over the weekend. Data on in-flight transmission updated Following receipt of more complete data, WHO is updating its statistics on cases of in-flight transmission of SARS. The number of flights during which transmission of SARS may have occurred remains at four. The total number of cases resulting from exposure during these four flights has been revised to 27. One flight alone, CA112, which flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 15 March, is now know to have accounted for 22 of the 27 cases. WHO is aware of an additional 31 flights with symptomatic probable SARS cases on board. No evidence indicates that in-flight transmission occurred on any of these flights. No flights have been implicated in the transmission of SARS after 23 March 2003. Complete data on seating information for all cases has not been obtained. However, it is now known that, on one flight, persons sitting seven rows in front and five row behind a person with symptomatic SARS developed the disease. WHO is aware of four flight attendants, of which two were on the CA112 flight, who have become infected. Report from the joint team in Henan Province, China “Community-based surveillance and control methods seem to be an important contributor to the apparently low levels of SARS infection in China’s rural countryside,” Dr. James Maguire says. Dr Maguire returned to Beijing three days ago from a six-day visit to China’s Henan Province. He travelled as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team. The group visited hospitals, clinics and basic health facilities in five prefectures in Henan. A full report of the team’s findings is being prepared and will soon be released. Dr Maguire says that numerous checkpoints on roads and at train and bus stations, where identification cards are checked and body temperatures recorded, seem to be an effective way of controlling the spread of SARS. “The fear of the disease is widespread. Combined with community surveillance and social and legal pressure, people are cooperating,” he says. Henan officials told the investigators around 1.4 million workers had returned to the province during the long holiday period around May 1. Many came from areas with higher rates of SARS infection, like Beijing and Guangdong. During the period from 26 April to 15 May, the team was told that at the checkpoints 12,028 people were found to be feverish and 955 had a cough. They were referred to “fever clinics” – basic triage centers where they were put into single-room isolation for further assessment. “We were told that nine of these cases were confirmed as being infected with SARS and eight were suspected cases,” Dr Maguire says. Ministry of Health statistics show there were 15 probable cases, including one in a health worker, and six suspect cases of SARS reported from Henan province as of May 22. Usually, returning workers from affected areas must stay under house quarantine for 15 days, staying apart from their family in a single room. Dr Maguire says to help with farming work, some local governments are offering financial assistance to have hired workers perform the necessary fieldwork or grants to enable people to buy farm machinery to lower the demand for human farm labour. “The screening at checkpoints and quarantining may seem like hitting a fly with a hammer, but they seem to be working,” Dr Maguire says. “Combined with the extreme social pressure brought on by the fear of SARS, China might have hit on a way to fight the spread of the disease.” ',)",922,24,2003-05-22a,"Update 62 - More than 8000 cases reported globally, situation in Taiwan, data on in-flight transmission, report on Henan Province, China",5/22/2003,https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2003_05_22-en/,SARS-CoV,NA,Global,NA,28 countries,NA,NA,8046,NA,682,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,2003,5,22,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2003_05_22-en,DON-2003-05-22-a,2003-05-22,"(""\n\n  * Global\n  * Regions\n\nWHO Regional websites\n\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\nWhen autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and\nenter to select.\n\nSelect language  Select language English العربية 中文 Français Русский Español\nPortuguês\n\n  * Home\n\n  * Health Topics\n\n  * All topics »\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Resources »\n    * Fact sheets\n    * Facts in pictures\n    * Multimedia\n    * Publications\n    * Questions & answers\n    * Tools and toolkits\n\n  * Popular »\n    * Air pollution\n    * Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n    * Hepatitis\n    * Monkeypox\n\n  * Countries\n\n  * All countries\xa0»\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Regions »\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\n  * WHO in countries »\n    * Statistics\n    * Cooperation strategies\n    * Ukraine emergency\n\n  * Newsroom\n\n  * All news »\n    * News releases\n    * Statements\n    * Campaigns\n    * Commentaries\n    * Events\n    * Feature stories\n    * Speeches\n    * Spotlights\n    * Newsletters\n    * Photo library\n    * Media distribution list\n\n  * Headlines\xa0»\n\n  * Emergencies\n\n  * Focus on »\n    * Afghanistan crisis\n    * COVID-19 pandemic\n    * Northern Ethiopia crisis\n    * Syria crisis\n    * Ukraine emergency\n    * Monkeypox outbreak\n    * Greater Horn of Africa crisis\n\n  * Latest »\n    * Disease Outbreak News\n    * Travel advice\n    * Situation reports\n    * Weekly Epidemiological Record\n\n  * WHO in emergencies »\n    * Surveillance\n    * Research\n    * Funding\n    * Partners\n    * Operations\n    * Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee\n    * WHO's Health Emergency Appeal 2023\n\n  * Data\n\n  * Data at WHO »\n    * Global Health Estimates\n    * Health SDGs\n    * Mortality Database\n    * Data collections\n\n  * Dashboards »\n    * COVID-19 Dashboard\n    * Triple Billion Dashboard\n    * Health Inequality Monitor\n\n  * Highlights »\n    * Global Health Observatory\n    * SCORE\n    * Insights and visualizations\n    * Data collection tools\n\n  * Reports »\n    * World Health Statistics 2022\n    * COVID excess deaths\n    * DDI IN FOCUS: 2022\n\n  * About WHO\n\n  * About WHO »\n    * People\n    * Teams\n    * Structure\n    * Partnerships and collaboration\n    * Collaborating centres\n    * Networks, committees and advisory groups\n    * Transformation\n\n  * Our Work »\n    * General Programme of Work\n    * WHO Academy\n    * Activities\n    * Initiatives\n\n  * Funding »\n    * Investment case\n    * WHO Foundation\n\n  * Accountability »\n    * Audit\n    * Programme Budget\n    * Financial statements\n    * Programme Budget Portal\n    * Results Report\n\n  * Governance »\n    * World Health Assembly\n    * Executive Board\n    * Election of Director-General\n    * Governing Bodies website\n    * Member States Portal\n\n  * Home/\n  * Disease Outbreak News/\n  * Item/\n  * Update 62 - More than 8000 cases reported globally, situation in Taiwan, data on in-flight transmission, report on Henan Province, China\n\n#  2003 - China\n\n22 May 2003\n\n22 May 2003  \nUpdate on cases and countries  \nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8046 probable SARS cases and 682 deaths\nhave been reported from 28 countries.

"(' 10 April 2013 - As of 10 April 2013 (18:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional four laboratory- confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus. Of the laboratory-confirmed cases, two are from Shanghai and two from Zhejiang. The first patient is a 62-year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on 1 April 2013, the second patient is a 77 year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on 3 April 2013, the third patient is a 51 year-old woman from Zhejiang who became ill on 13 March, and the fourth patient is a 79 year-old man from Zhejiang who became ill on 29 March 2013. In addition, two patients earlier reported from Jiangsu (83-year-old man) and Anhui (35-year-old woman) have died. To date, a total of 28 cases have been laboratory confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, including nine deaths, 14 severe cases and five mild cases. More than 600 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. In Jiangsu, investigation is ongoing into a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness. The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance. Retrospective testing of recently reported cases with severe respiratory infection may uncover additional cases that were previously unrecognized. An inter-government task force has been formally established, with the National Health and Family Planning Commission leading the coordination along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other key ministries. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that information is available and that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). At this time there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied. ### About this Disease Outbreak News 1\\. WHO is currently publishing information on laboratory confirmed cases received through the official notification from the Chinese National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point once a day. This formal notification and publication follows verification of the information, and may therefore come after, or not include, some cases reported through public media and other sources. 2\\. To date, there is limited information to determine whether the reported number of cases represents some or all of the cases actually occurring. As some relatively mild cases of illness have now been reported, it is possible that there are other such cases that have not been identified and reported. 3\\. If the current pattern of sporadic infections continues, WHO will cease frequent reporting of case numbers, and focus its Disease Outbreak News on new developments or changes in the pattern or presentation of infections.

Of the laboratory-confirmed cases, two are from Shanghai and two from Zhejiang. The first patient is a 62-year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on 1 April 2013, the second patient is a 77 year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on 3 April 2013, the third patient is a 51 year-old woman from Zhejiang who became ill on 13 March, and the fourth patient is a 79 year-old man from Zhejiang who became ill on 29 March 2013. In addition, two patients earlier reported from Jiangsu (83-year-old man) and Anhui (35-year-old woman) have died. To date, a total of 28 cases have been laboratory confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, including nine deaths, 14 severe cases and five mild cases. More than 600 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. In Jiangsu, investigation is ongoing into a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness. The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance.

"("" 23 June 2008 - Following an unexplained cluster of deaths in children from the NGagne Diaw quarter of Thiaroye sur Mer, Dakar, Senegal, an investigation by health and environmental authorities revealed that the area was contaminated with lead from the informal recycling of lead batteries. In addition, siblings and mothers of the dead children were found to have extremely high blood lead concentrations, in many cases above 1000 μg/L (in children, a concentration above 100 μg/L may impair neurological development, and 700 μg/L is considered to require immediate action). Following a formal request from Senegal, WHO has deployed an international team consisting of a clinical toxicologist, an environmental health specialist and analytical chemist. This team has conducted clinical examinations and further environmental investigations in NGagne Diaw. Clinical examinations have confirmed continuing high blood lead concentrations in the original group studied, as well as in a randomly-selected group of adults and children who were not involved in lead recycling. Many children are showing evidence of neurological damage. Environmental investigations have found very high concentrations of lead both outside and inside peoples' homes. These have been mapped to an area inhabited by approximately 950 people, who are continuously exposed through ingestion and inhalation of lead-contaminated dust. WHO has advised the Senegalese authorities about the need for urgent action to terminate exposure of the affected population to lead, and to provide chelation and other therapy to children with high blood lead concentrations. Chelation therapy in children who continue to be exposed to lead is ineffective and may exacerbate toxicity. Plans are in hand to hospitalize the worst-affected cases, but they will then need to be able to return to a lead- free environment. WHO has provided chelating agents, and the clinical toxicologist has started training local medical staff. Further systematic investigation of the population of NGagne Diaw is needed, as well as the administration of appropriate treatment. Thorough decontamination of the affected area of NGagne Diaw, including the insides of homes, is a high priority. To deal effectively with this environmental and public health emergency the Senegalese authorities will require urgent technical and financial assistance from the international community. WHO is briefing its UN and other partners about the situation in order to facilitate the provision of the necessary resources. #### For more information "",)",1563,26,2008-06-23,Lead intoxication in Senegal,6/23/2008,https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2008_06_23-en/,Toxicity: lead poisoning,NA,Senegal,SEN,"NGagne Diaw Quarter, Thiaroye sur Mer, Dakar",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2008_06_23-en,DON-2008-06-23,2008-06-23,"(""\n\n  * Global\n  * Regions\n\nWHO Regional websites\n\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\nWhen autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and\nenter to select.\n\nSelect language  Select language English العربية 中文 Français Русский Español\nPortuguês\n\n  * Home\n\n  * Health Topics\n\n  * All topics »\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Resources »\n    * Fact sheets\n    * Facts in pictures\n    * Multimedia\n    * Publications\n    * Questions & answers\n    * Tools and toolkits\n\n  * Popular »\n    * Air pollution\n    * Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n    * Hepatitis\n    * Monkeypox\n\n  * Countries\n\n  * All countries\xa0»\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Regions »\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\n  * WHO in countries »\n    * Statistics\n    * Cooperation strategies\n    * Ukraine emergency\n\n  * Newsroom\n\n  * All news »\n    * News releases\n    * Statements\n    * Campaigns\n    * Commentaries\n    * Events\n    * Feature stories\n    * Speeches\n    * Spotlights\n    * Newsletters\n    * Photo library\n    * Media distribution list\n\n  * Headlines\xa0»\n\n  * Emergencies\n\n  * Focus on »\n    * Afghanistan crisis\n    * COVID-19 pandemic\n    * Northern Ethiopia crisis\n    * Syria crisis\n    * Ukraine emergency\n    * Monkeypox outbreak\n    * Greater Horn of Africa crisis\n\n  * Latest »\n    * Disease Outbreak News\n    * Travel advice\n    * Situation reports\n    * Weekly Epidemiological Record\n\n  * WHO in emergencies »\n    * Surveillance\n    * Research\n    * Funding\n    * Partners\n    * Operations\n    * Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee\n    * WHO's Health Emergency Appeal 2023\n\n  * Data\n\n  * Data at WHO »\n    * Global Health Estimates\n    * Health SDGs\n    * Mortality Database\n    * Data collections\n\n  * Dashboards »\n    * COVID-19 Dashboard\n    * Triple Billion Dashboard\n    * Health Inequality Monitor\n\n  * Highlights »\n    * Global Health Observatory\n    * SCORE\n    * Insights and visualizations\n    * Data collection tools\n\n  * Reports »\n    * World Health Statistics 2022\n    * COVID excess deaths\n    * DDI IN FOCUS: 2022\n\n  * About WHO\n\n  * About WHO »\n    * People\n    * Teams\n    * Structure\n    * Partnerships and collaboration\n    * Collaborating centres\n    * Networks, committees and advisory groups\n    * Transformation\n\n  * Our Work »\n    * General Programme of Work\n    * WHO Academy\n    * Activities\n    * Initiatives\n\n  * Funding »\n    * Investment case\n    * WHO Foundation\n\n  * Accountability »\n    * Audit\n    * Programme Budget\n    * Financial statements\n    * Programme Budget Portal\n    * Results Report\n\n  * Governance »\n    * World Health Assembly\n    * Executive Board\n    * Election of Director-General\n    * Governing Bodies website\n    * Member States Portal\n\n  * Home/\n  * Disease Outbreak News/\n  * Item/\n  * Lead intoxication in Senegal\n\n#  2008 - Senegal\n\n23 June 2008\n\n23 June 2008 - Following an unexplained cluster of deaths in children from the\nNGagne Diaw quarter of Thiaroye sur Mer, Dakar, Senegal, an investigation by\nhealth and environmental authorities revealed that the area was contaminated\nwith lead from the informal recycling of lead batteries.

"(' 16 February 2013 - The United Kingdom (UK) has informed WHO of another confirmed case of infection with the novel coronavirus (NCoV). This is the third case confirmed in the country this month and is in the same family cluster as the two recently confirmed cases. The latest confirmed case does not have recent travel history outside the UK. The case is recovering from mild respiratory illness and is currently well. The confirmation with NCoV in this case with no recent travel history indicates that infection was acquired in the UK. Although this new case offers further indications of person-to-person transmission, no sustained person-to- person transmission has been identified. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is following up on all close contacts who may have been exposed to the recently confirmed cases. As of 16 February 2013, WHO has been informed of a total of 12 confirmed cases of human infection with NCoV, including five deaths. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Testing for the new coronavirus should be considered in patients with unexplained pneumonias, or in patients with unexplained severe, progressive or complicated respiratory illness not responding to treatment. Any clusters of SARI or SARI in healthcare workers should be thoroughly investigated, regardless of where in the world they occur. New cases and clusters of the NCoV should be reported promptly both to national health authorities and to WHO. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

"(' Between 15 and 16 March 2016, PAHO/WHO was notified of cases of Zika virus infection in Dominica and Cuba. ### Dominica On 15 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Dominica notified PAHO/WHO of the country’s first autochthonous case of Zika virus infection. The case is a 28-year-old female who developed symptoms on 1 March and, on 4 March, presented to hospital. Symptoms included retro-orbital pain, frontal headache, mild conjunctivitis, and a rash on the chest and arms. Infection with the Zika virus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the sub-regional reference laboratory at the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). The patient had no recent history of international travel. No other family members or neighbours are reported to be symptomatic. Health authorities in Dominica are taking the following measures: * carrying out environmental investigation and treatment of the dwelling and work places of the case as well as the surrounding environments, including space spraying; * intensifying public education programs in both the public and private sector; * continuing national clean-up campaigns; * continuing communication for healthcare workers; * mobilizing national and regional resources. ### Cuba On 16 March 2016, the Ministry of Health of Cuba reported through a press release the country’s first autochthonous case of Zika virus infection. The case is a 21-year-old resident of Central Havana, Havana province. The patient has no history of travel outside of the country. On 7 March, he developed headache, retro-orbital pain and conjunctivitis. On 9 March, the patient presented to a hospital where his blood samples were collected. On 14 March, Zika virus infection was laboratory confirmed by PCR at the Institute of Tropical Medicine Pedro Kouri. Health authorities in Cuba are taking the following measures: * carrying social risk communication; * strengthening vector control measures and eliminating mosquito breeding sites. ### WHO risk assessment The detection of autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection indicates that the virus is spreading geographically to previously unaffected areas (Dominica and Cuba). The notification of autochthonous transmission in a new country does not change the overall risk assessment. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Although the risk of transmission of Zika virus through sexual activity is considered to be very limited, based on precautionary principles, WHO recommends the following: * All patients (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the potential risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus, contraceptive measures and safer sexual practices, and should be provided with condoms when feasible. Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant because of concern with infection with Zika virus should also have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling. * Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should use safer sexual practices or abstinence from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy. * As most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic: * Men and women living in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should consider adopting safer sexual practices or abstaining from sexual activity. * Men and women returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sexual practices or consider abstinence for at least four weeks after return. Independently of considerations regarding Zika virus, WHO always recommends the use of safer sexual practices, including the correct and consistent use of condoms to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies. WHO does not recommend routine semen testing to detect Zika virus. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Dominica and Cuba based on the current information available.

The risk of a global spread of\nZika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are\npresent is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these\nmosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the\nepidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest\navailable information.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nThe proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a\nsignificant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control\nrelies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction\n(removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between\nmosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural\nand artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing\nthe adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using\nbarriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and\nrepellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission)\nare day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the\ndaytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under\nmosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide\nprotection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the\nlikelihood of being bitten.\n\nDuring outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following\nthe technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable\ninsecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be\nused as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is\ntechnically indicated.\n\nBasic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people\ntraveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of\nrepellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring\nrooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.\n\nAlthough the risk of transmission of Zika virus through sexual activity is\nconsidered to be very limited, based on precautionary principles, WHO\nrecommends the following:\n\n  * All patients (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the potential risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus, contraceptive measures and safer sexual practices, and should be provided with condoms when feasible. Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant because of concern with infection with Zika virus should also have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling.\n  * Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should use safer sexual practices or abstinence from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy.\n  * As most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic:\n    * Men and women living in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should consider adopting safer sexual practices or abstaining from sexual activity.\n    * Men and women returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sexual practices or consider abstinence for at least four weeks after return.\n\nIndependently of considerations regarding Zika virus, WHO always recommends\nthe use of safer sexual practices, including the correct and consistent use of\ncondoms to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unwanted\npregnancies.\n\nWHO does not recommend routine semen testing to detect Zika virus.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Dominica and Cuba\nbased on the current information available.\n\n',)",6200,"(' Between 15 and 16 March 2016, PAHO/WHO was notified of cases of Zika virus infection in Dominica and Cuba. ### Dominica On 15 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Dominica notified PAHO/WHO of the country’s first autochthonous case of Zika virus infection.

"(' 26 April 2014 - On 26 April 2014, the Ministry of Health of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported seven additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). #### The following details were provided to WHO on 24 April 2014: * A 45 year-old woman from Abu Dhabi who is a daughter of a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on 22 April. She became ill on 15 April. She is reported to have an underlying medical condition, and has no history of recent travel or contact with animals. * A 4 year-old boy from Abu Dhabi. He developed mild illness on 19 April. He is reported to have no underlying medical condition, and does not have a history of recent travel or contact with animals. His mother returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia 10 days prior to his illness. * A 37 year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on 10 April. He is reported to have underlying medical conditions. He has no history of recent travel, but frequently visits the two farms he owns. * A 32 year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened, following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on 10 April. He did not become ill and does not have any underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel and did not have contact with animals. * A 33 year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on 10 April. He did not become ill and is reported to have no underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel. He owns two farms and is reported to have contact with camels. * A 30 year-old man from Abu Dhabi. He was screened following exposure with a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on 10 April. He does not have any underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel and did not have contact with animals. * A 42 year-old man from Abu Dhabi. He was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on 10 April. He had mild illness. He is reported to have no underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel and had no contact with animals. To date, all the abovementioned cases are in isolation in a hospital and are well. Screening of other contacts within the health care setting and families are ongoing. Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 261 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health- care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract. Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented. People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating.

"(' 3 February 2012 - In December 2011, the Ministry of Health of Cameroon notified WHO of a yellow fever outbreak in the North Region of the country. A total of 23 cases, including 7 deaths, have been reported to have occurred since October 2011 in Guider, Bibemi, Gaschiga, Lagdo, Mayo Oulo and Golombe districts. These cases were identified as part of the surveillance system, with fever and jaundice within the 14 days of onset. At least 13 cases from six health districts were laboratory confirmed at the Institute Pasteur of Cameroon by IgM ELISA test, which was followed by the seroneutralizing test (PRNT), the most specific test for yellow fever, and by differential diagnostic for dengue and West Nile Virus conducted in the WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, the Institute Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal. WHO country office has been working with the government/health authorities in the outbreak field investigation to confirm the cases and assess the extent of the outbreak. GAVI Alliance, UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) are supporting a reactive mass vaccination campaign which aims to cover over 1.2 million people in 8 health districts considered at high risk, namely Guider, Bibemi, Gaschiga, Lagdo, Mayo Oulo, Garoua I Garoua II, and Golombe.

"(' 29 October 2013 - WHO has been informed of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Qatar. The patient is a 23-year-old man who was identified as a close contact of a previously laboratory-confirmed case as part of the epidemiological investigation. He is a worker in the animal barn owned by the previously laboratory-confirmed case. The man developed mild symptoms of illness and is in good condition. Preliminary investigations revealed that he did not recently travel outside the country. Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 145 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 62 deaths. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms. Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation.

"(' In Pakistan, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected from environmental samples in Quetta, Balochistan. Two isolates with apparent genetic linkages were isolated from environmental samples, collected on 20 October and 28 November 2016. Virus was isolated from environmental samples only and no associated cases of paralysis linked to the isolated strains have been detected in Quetta or anywhere else in the province. Pakistan also continues to be affected by endemic transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). As of 21 December, 19 WPV1 cases have been reported in 2016. It is the lowest number of annual cases ever reported, from the fewest number of affected areas in the country. The majority of the polio cases during the last six months were reported from non-reservoir areas, i.e. from ‘tier 2, 3 and 4’ districts (districts which are considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection). There have been no paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in Pakistan since February 2016. ### Public health response A response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in the Quetta and neighbouring districts is now planned, in line with internationally-agreed protocols. The first campaign of a series of campaigns is planned for 2 January 2017. In addition, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoHSRC), supported by World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other partners, is further strengthening active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and conducting an in-depth field investigation to more clearly ascertain the circulation of this strain. Pakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, to urgently interrupt all remaining strains of polio transmission in the country. The area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational common reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting WPV1 transmission in this area remains the top most priority of the federal, provincial and district health teams. Meticulous preparations are underway through the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and District Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of upcoming back- to-back national and sub-national vaccination rounds, in December 2016, January 2017 and February 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). These campaigns are critical to addressing the remaining pockets of under-immunized populations sustaining low-intensity WPV1 transmission within the common reservoir. To ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate resources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified reasons for missed children; validating vaccination teams’ microplans, vaccinator selection, training and supervision; and enhancing local engagement with communities through community leaders. In order to jointly address transmission across the common reservoir, close coordination is ongoing with Afghanistan teams at all levels. ### WHO risk assessment WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common reservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical spread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with Afghanistan). WHO also assesses the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the common reservoir as medium to high. Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to other countries is assessed low. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission is subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure.

Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to other countries is assessed low. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission is subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure. ',)",4997,27-december-2016-polio-pakistan-en
"(' 27 September 2006 The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the country’s 68th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The patient is a 20-year- old male from Bandung, West Java. He developed symptoms of fever and cough on 17 September and was hospitalized on 24 September. He remains hospitalized. The man’s 24-year-old brother developed symptoms on 16 September. He died of respiratory disease on 24 September, two hours after admission to hospital. Infection with the H5N1 virus is suspected for the 23-year-old male, but cannot be confirmed as no samples were collected for testing. Both men had direct contact with dead chickens when feeding carcasses to their dogs. Local agricultural authorities also found evidence of H5 infection in household birds. A third sibling, a 15-year-old female, was hospitalized on 25 September after developing symptoms of fever and cough. Initial test results received on 27 September were negative for the H5 virus subtype and positive for the H1 subtype, indicating an infection with normal seasonal influenza. She remains hospitalized in a stable condition. Of the 68 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 51 have been fatal.

"(' #### Weekly update 29 January 2010 - As of 24 January 2010, worldwide more than 209 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 14711 deaths. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information. ##### Situation update: Although much of the temperate northern hemisphere passed a peak of fall and wintertime pandemic influenza activity between late October and late November 2009, virus transmission remain active in several later affected areas, particularly in North Africa, limited areas of eastern and southeastern Europe, and in parts of South and East Asia. In North Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active and geographically widespread, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and in Egypt, although most countries in the region appeared to have recently passed a peak of activity during December 2009 or January 2010. In west Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues be geographically regional to widespread, however activity levels have continued to decline or remain low since December 2009. In South Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains active but geographically variable. Recent peaks in activity were noted during late December and early January 2010 in northern India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Influenza activity remained stable but elevated in western India, continued to decline substantially in northern India, and remained low overall in southern and eastern India. In Bangladesh, regional spread influenza activity and a low intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported. In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active, however, overall activity continued to decline in most countries. An increasing trend in respiratory diseases with localized spread was reported for DPR Korea. In the Republic of Korea, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active (>20% respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic H1N1), however, overall activity continue to decline since peaking during November 2009. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decline, however high levels of transmission persist on the southern island of Okinawa. In northern and southern China, pandemic virus isolations have declined substantially since peaking early to mid November 2009, however, in recent weeks detections of influenza type B viruses have increased. In southeast Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists, but current activity levels are low. In Vietnam, influenza activity has declined substantially since peaking during October and November 2009. In Thailand, focal outbreaks of influenza were reported from a few provinces in northern and central parts of the country, however, overall ILI activity remains low. In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically regional to widespread in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the continent, however, overall activity continues to decline in most places. Several countries (Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and the Russian Federation) reported slight increases in the levels of ARI or ILI activity, however in most, levels remain well below recent peaks in activity. The overall rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (16%) continued to fall since peaking (45%) during early November 2009. In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. Of note, detections of RSV have increased in a few countries in the Americas, which may partially account for elevated ILI activity in those areas, particularly among young children. In the US and Canada, pandemic influenza virus detections and the numbers of severe and fatal cases have decline substantially as rates of ILI have fallen below seasonal baselines. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places. In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant virus circulating worldwide. Seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating at low levels in parts of Africa, east and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza. For more information on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance please see the weekly virology update (Virological surveillance data, below). *Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these two latitudes. **Abbreviations: influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) #### From the published literature: A recent case series of 43 pregnant women hospitalized with laboratory confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza in Victoria (Australia) highlights the risks of influenza infection during pregnancy (Hewagama et al, CID 2010:50). In the study, half of all pregnant women had no other identifiable underlying medical condition, however, the overall prevalence of asthma, diabetes, and obesity among the group was greater than that observed in the general population of Australia. The majority of cases presented during their second trimester (30%) or third trimester (65%). The most common clinical presentation was uncomplicated influenza-like-illness (58%), however, approximately 28% had evidence of pneumonia, 20% required intensive care, and one case died. Six (40%) of 15 women at <37 weeks gestation delivered preterm; and among these six births, two died in utero and one died after delivery. Five of six pregnant women who delivered prematurely also had chest X-ray evidence of pneumonia. Notably, of the seven neonates tested for H1N1, including one who died because of complications related to premature birth, all tested negative for H1N1. Although the spectrum of influenza illness during pregnancy is broad, ranging from mild to severe, this publication again illustrates the increased risk of severe influenza associated with pregnancy, particularly among pregnant women in the second and third trimester and among those with underlying medical conditions. In addition, WHO clinical management guidelines recognizes pregnancy as a high risk condition for severe outcome and recommends early treatment of pregnant women with oseltamivir or zanamivir even in the absence of other risk factors. #### Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 2: 13 July 2009 - 17 January 2010) The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services. The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators reported. Information is available for approximately 60 countries each week. Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and completeness of reporting is expected to increase over time. ##### Geographic spread of influenza activity ##### Trend of respiratory diseases activity compared to the previous week ##### Intensity of acute respiratory diseases in the population ##### Impact on health care services ##### Laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 as officially reported to WHO by States Parties to the IHR (2005) as of 24 January 2010 The countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly reported their first pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed cases since the last web update (No. 84): none.

In west Asia, pandemic influenza\nactivity continues be geographically regional to widespread, however activity\nlevels have continued to decline or remain low since December 2009.\n\nIn South Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains active but geographically\nvariable. Recent peaks in activity were noted during late December and early\nJanuary 2010 in northern India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Influenza activity\nremained stable but elevated in western India, continued to decline\nsubstantially in northern India, and remained low overall in southern and\neastern India. In Bangladesh, regional spread influenza activity and a low\nintensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported.\n\nIn East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active,\nhowever, overall activity continued to decline in most countries. An\nincreasing trend in respiratory diseases with localized spread was reported\nfor DPR Korea. In the Republic of Korea, transmission of pandemic influenza\nvirus remains active (>20% respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic\nH1N1), however, overall activity continue to decline since peaking during\nNovember 2009. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decline, however high\nlevels of transmission persist on the southern island of Okinawa. In northern\nand southern China, pandemic virus isolations have declined substantially\nsince peaking early to mid November 2009, however, in recent weeks detections\nof influenza type B viruses have increased.\n\nIn southeast Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists, but\ncurrent activity levels are low. In Vietnam, influenza activity has declined\nsubstantially since peaking during October and November 2009. In Thailand,\nfocal outbreaks of influenza were reported from a few provinces in northern\nand central parts of the country, however, overall ILI activity remains low.\n\nIn Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically\nregional to widespread in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the\ncontinent, however, overall activity continues to decline in most places.\nSeveral countries (Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and the Russian\nFederation) reported slight increases in the levels of ARI or ILI activity,\nhowever in most, levels remain well below recent peaks in activity. The\noverall rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (16%)\ncontinued to fall since peaking (45%) during early November 2009.\n\nIn the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall\npandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places.\nOf note, detections of RSV have increased in a few countries in the Americas,\nwhich may partially account for elevated ILI activity in those areas,\nparticularly among young children. In the US and Canada, pandemic influenza\nvirus detections and the numbers of severe and fatal cases have decline\nsubstantially as rates of ILI have fallen below seasonal baselines. In Central\nAmerica and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but\noverall activity remains low or unchanged in most places.\n\nIn temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic\ninfluenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community\ntransmission.  \n  \nPandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant virus\ncirculating worldwide. Seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating at low\nlevels in parts of Africa, east and Southeast Asia and are being detected only\nsporadically on other continents.\n\nThe Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the\nglobal circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and\nother influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans\nincluding seasonal influenza.

In the\nstudy, half of all pregnant women had no other identifiable underlying medical\ncondition, however, the overall prevalence of asthma, diabetes, and obesity\namong the group was greater than that observed in the general population of\nAustralia. The majority of cases presented during their second trimester (30%)\nor third trimester (65%). The most common clinical presentation was\nuncomplicated influenza-like-illness (58%), however, approximately 28% had\nevidence of pneumonia, 20% required intensive care, and one case died. Six\n(40%) of 15 women at <37 weeks gestation delivered preterm; and among these\nsix births, two died in utero and one died after delivery. Five of six\npregnant women who delivered prematurely also had chest X-ray evidence of\npneumonia. Notably, of the seven neonates tested for H1N1, including one who\ndied because of complications related to premature birth, all tested negative\nfor H1N1.\n\nAlthough the spectrum of influenza illness during pregnancy is broad, ranging\nfrom mild to severe, this publication again illustrates the increased risk of\nsevere influenza associated with pregnancy, particularly among pregnant women\nin the second and third trimester and among those with underlying medical\nconditions. In addition, WHO clinical management guidelines recognizes\npregnancy as a high risk condition for severe outcome and recommends early\ntreatment of pregnant women with oseltamivir or zanamivir even in the absence\nof other risk factors.\n\n  * WHO Clinical Management Guidelines for Human infection with Pandemic (H1N1), 2009:\n  * WHO Guidelines for Pharmacological Management of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza and other Influenza Viruses: \n\n#### Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 2: 13 July 2009 - 17 January\n2010)\n\nThe qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza,\ntrends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease\nactivity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services.\n\n  * Human infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus: updated interim WHO guidance on global surveillance  \nA description of WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance objectives and\nmethods can be found in the updated interim WHO guidance for the surveillance\nof human infection with pandemic (H1N1) virus.\n\nThe maps below display information on the qualitative indicators reported.\nInformation is available for approximately 60 countries each week.\nImplementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and completeness of\nreporting is expected to increase over time.\n\n  * List of definitions of qualitative indicators\n\n##### Geographic spread of influenza activity\n\n  * Map timeline\n\n##### Trend of respiratory diseases activity compared to the previous week\n\n  * Map timeline\n\n#####  Intensity of acute respiratory diseases in the population\n\n  * Map timeline\n\n#####  Impact on health care services\n\n  * Map timeline\n\n##### Laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 as officially\nreported to WHO by States Parties to the IHR (2005) as of 24 January 2010\n\n  * Map of affected countries and deaths\n\nThe countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly reported\ntheir first pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed cases since the last web update\n(No. 84): none.\n\nThe countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly reported\ntheir first deaths among pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed cases since the last\nweb update (No. 84): Cyprus and Nigeria.\n\nRegion\n\nDeaths*  \n  \n\n\n\xa0  \n  \nWHO Regional Office for  Africa (AFRO)\n\n133  \n  \nWHO Regional Office for the  Americas (AMRO)\n\nAt least 7166  \n  \nWHO Regional Office for the  Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO)\n\n1002  \n  \nWHO Regional Office for  Europe (EURO)\n\nAt least 3429  \n  \nWHO Regional Office for  South-East Asia (SEARO)\n\n1426  \n  \nWHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO)\n\n1555  \n  \n\n\n\xa0  \n  \nTotal*\n\nAt least 14711  \n  \n* The reported number of fatal cases is an under representation of the actual numbers as many deaths are never tested or recognized as influenza related.\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",13993,"('\n\n#### Weekly update\n\n29 January 2010 - As of 24 January 2010, worldwide more than 209 countries and\noverseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases\nof pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 14711 deaths.\n\nWHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent\nconsultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through\nmonitoring of multiple sources of information.\n\n##### Situation update:\n\nAlthough much of the temperate northern hemisphere passed a peak of fall and\nwintertime pandemic influenza activity between late October and late November\n2009, virus transmission remain active in several later affected areas,\nparticularly in North Africa, limited areas of eastern and southeastern\nEurope, and in parts of South and East Asia.\n\nIn North Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus\ntransmission remains active and geographically widespread, particularly in\nMorocco, Algeria, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and in Egypt, although most\ncountries in the region appeared to have recently passed a peak of activity\nduring December 2009 or January 2010.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information. ##### Situation update: Although much of the temperate northern hemisphere passed a peak of fall and wintertime pandemic influenza activity between late October and late November 2009, virus transmission remain active in several later affected areas, particularly in North Africa, limited areas of eastern and southeastern Europe, and in parts of South and East Asia. In North Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active and geographically widespread, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and in Egypt, although most countries in the region appeared to have recently passed a peak of activity during December 2009 or January 2010. In west Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues be geographically regional to widespread, however activity levels have continued to decline or remain low since December 2009. In South Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains active but geographically variable. Recent peaks in activity were noted during late December and early January 2010 in northern India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Influenza activity remained stable but elevated in western India, continued to decline substantially in northern India, and remained low overall in southern and eastern India. In Bangladesh, regional spread influenza activity and a low intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported. In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active, however, overall activity continued to decline in most countries. An increasing trend in respiratory diseases with localized spread was reported for DPR Korea. In the Republic of Korea, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active (>20% respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic H1N1), however, overall activity continue to decline since peaking during November 2009. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decline, however high levels of transmission persist on the southern island of Okinawa. In northern and southern China, pandemic virus isolations have declined substantially since peaking early to mid November 2009, however, in recent weeks detections of influenza type B viruses have increased. In southeast Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists, but current activity levels are low. In Vietnam, influenza activity has declined substantially since peaking during October and November 2009. In Thailand, focal outbreaks of influenza were reported from a few provinces in northern and central parts of the country, however, overall ILI activity remains low. In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically regional to widespread in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the continent, however, overall activity continues to decline in most places. Several countries (Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and the Russian Federation) reported slight increases in the levels of ARI or ILI activity, however in most, levels remain well below recent peaks in activity. The overall rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (16%) continued to fall since peaking (45%) during early November 2009. In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. Of note, detections of RSV have increased in a few countries in the Americas, which may partially account for elevated ILI activity in those areas, particularly among young children. In the US and Canada, pandemic influenza virus detections and the numbers of severe and fatal cases have decline substantially as rates of ILI have fallen below seasonal baselines. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places. In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant virus circulating worldwide. Seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating at low levels in parts of Africa, east and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

Of these cases 35.3% (CFR=4.9%) have occurred in Khartoum state, while 26% have occurred in North Kordofan state. The remaining cases have occurred in White Nile, South Darfur, South Kordofan, Kassala, Red Sea, Al Gezira and River Nile. The overall CFR during this period is 3.8%. The National Public Health Laboratory of the FMoH has confirmed the isolation of Vibrio cholerae 01 Inaba in 70 out of 139 stool samples (50%) collected so far from these states. The FMoH has formed a task force, including UNICEF and WHO to coordinate the overall response to the epidemic. WHO is also supplying diarrhoeal disease kits as well as laboratory supplies for the collection of samples and enteric disease bacteriology kits for establishing field laboratories to increase laboratory surveillance capacities in several affected states. Between 28 January and 14 June 2006, a total of 16 187 cases, including 476 deaths (CFR=3%) of acute watery diarrhoea has been reported in 8 out of 10 states in southern Sudan (see previous report). Vibrio cholerae 01 Inaba has been laboratory confirmed in several stool samples by African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) laboratories in Nairobi. A task force under the Ministry of Health of the Government of Southern Sudan (MOH/GoSS), including the FMoH, WHO, other UN and non-governmental partners has been established to coordinate the overall public health response.

"(' 13 January 2004 Summary (to 3 January 2004) Influenza activity associated with A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses continued to be widespread in some countries in Europe (Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Switzerland) and in the USA. Compared with the significant increase in previous weeks, influenza A(H3N2) activity seemed to be levelling off although, in several central and eastern European countries (Croatia, Latvia and Switzerland), it continued to increase. So far this season influenza B activity has been low and reported only from Asian countries (Republic of Korea and Thailand). Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized so far have been A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the others have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. Following last week’s update on the A(H5N1) outbreak in the Republic of Korea, no more farms have been reported to be infected by avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. The National Influenza Centre in the Republic of Korea has finished sampling sera from persons in contact with suspect infected animals and nearby residents, and will start serological studies shortly. Avian influenza virus A(H5N1) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of avian influenza in two southern provinces of Viet Nam; there is also information on outbreaks of avian influenza in other provinces. The virus, which spreads rapidly and has a mortality approaching 100% in chickens, has resulted in the deaths of 40 000 chickens and the culling of 30 000 more. Pigs and ducks are also reported to have been infected. Since the end of October 2003, hospitals in Hanoi and surrounding provinces have admitted 14 persons with severe respiratory illness – 13 children and one adult (the mother of a deceased child). To date, 11 of the children and the adult have died. The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Viet Nam and the National Influenza Centre in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (Hong Kong SAR) confirmed that three of these cases were infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. At present, there is no evidence that human-to-human transmission is occurring, and no health care workers have been infected. More information is available on the WHO web site. Belgium. Influenza A(H3N2) activity declined in week 1 (28 December 2003 to 3 January 2004) in terms both of the number of viruses identified and of the influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate. Canada. In week 1, widespread influenza activity was reported in Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and some parts of British Columbia. Overall ILI consultation rate dropped from 79 cases per 1000 consultations in week 52 of 2003 to 36 cases per 1000. Of the 456 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 429 (94%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (6%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2). Croatia. Influenza A(H3N2) activity increased significantly in week 1, with 6 influenza A(H3N2) and 9 A non-subtyped viruses identified. Czech Republic. Influenza A(H3N2) activity remained localized in week 1, with ILI consultation rate below the baseline level. Finland. Influenza A(H3N2) activity remained widespread in week 1, but with a significant decrease in the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases since week 52 of 2003. France. Influenza activity continued to decline in France, although widespread influenza A(H3N2) activity still persisted in many regions. Denmark. Influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported as widespread in week 1, when the ILI consultation rate declined after being above the epidemic threshold for 3 weeks. Germany. A continuing slight increase of regional influenza activity was observed in week 1. Israel. Influenza activity has been in decline since week 51 of 2003. Latvia. Influenza activity remained at a low level, but with a slight increase since week 49 of 2003. Norway. After a peak in weeks 49 and50, clinical and virological indicators showed that influenza A(H3N2) activity, while still widespread in most parts of the country, declined gradually in week 1. Of 882 influenza A virus detected so far, 187 have been subtyped as A(H3) and 26 as A(H1). All A(H3) strains antigenically characterized were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, and all A(H1) strains were A/New Caledonia/20/99-like. Portugal. Influenza activity remained sporadic in week 1 with 1 influenza A(H3N2) virus detected. Republic of Korea. Influenza B activity has been reported since week 49. Romania. Influenza A(H3N2) activity has declined rapidly since week 52 and was reported as sporadic in week 1. Switzerland. Influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported as widespread in week 1, with an increase in the ILI consultation rate in all regions of the country. United Kingdom. Influenza activity continued to decline in week 1, with a falling ILI consultation rate reported in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In England, the ILI consultation rate increased slightly, probably because of the disruption of service over the Christmas and New Year period. During week 1, no influenza virus was detected. Of the viruses antigenically characterized, 102 (95.3%) have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like. United States. The overall ILI consultation rate (6.2%) decreased for the first time this season; the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza and the number of states reporting widespread influenza activity also decreased. However, pneumonia and influenza mortality (9.4%) continued to increase and exceeded the epidemic threshold (8.0%). Widespread influenza activity was reported in 38 states, New York City and the District of Columbia, and regional activity was reported in 9 states during week 1. Of the specimens tested, 20.7%were positive for influenza, with 635 influenza A viruses and 6 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 454 A(H3N2) viruses and 5 B viruses from the USA. Of the 454 A(H3N2) viruses characterized, 98 (21.6%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like and 356 (78.4%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like. Other reports. Low influenza activity was reported in Greece, Hong Kong SAR, Italy and Japan. Argentina and Poland reported no influenza activity.

"(' On 20 April 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for Germany informed WHO that a previously reported case of Lassa fever in Germany has fully recovered and been discharged from hospital in Frankfurt. This secondary case was an employee of the funeral home tasked with handling the primary case’s corpse on 2 March (see DON posted 23 March). The case had recovered by 6 April, when all the contacts completed their 21-day follow-up period, however his hospital discharge was delayed due to persistent viraemia. The patient was discharged after two consecutive negative test results by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Tests were performed on blood, urine, and pharyngeal swab samples at 24-hour intervals. ### WHO risk assessment Based on the current information, there is no further risk of secondary transmission of Lassa fever in Germany.

"(' 8 August 2006 The Ministry of Health in China has today retrospectively confirmed a human case of H5N1 infection dating back to November 2003. The case occurred in a 24-year-old member of the military service based in Beijing. The man developed symptoms on 25 November 2003 and was hospitalized with pneumonia in Beijing. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died of severe respiratory disease on 3 December 2003. Confirmation of this case marks the earliest known instance of human H5N1 infection in mainland China, and is now the first confirmed case in the present outbreak. Previously, the first confirmed cases were thought to have occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003. The case was initially reported by several Chinese researchers, affiliated with the military services, in a June 2006 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. According to that communication, doctors initially suspected the man might have been infected with the SARS virus. Although WHO declared the SARS outbreak over in July 2003, suspicions were high that the virus might return during the cooler months. Specimens tested for SARS infection prior to the man’s death were negative, but the cause of death remained undetermined. As stated in the published letter, stored specimens from the man subsequently tested positive for H5N1 infection. Successful isolation of the virus from these specimens was also reported. As the man’s illness was initially thought to be SARS, no history of possible poultry exposure was taken. The source of his H5N1 infection remains uncertain, particularly as no poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in Beijing. The Ministry of Health informed WHO that it had been unaware of these tests and their results prior to publication of the research letter. In line with WHO recommendations, confirmatory testing in a laboratory affiliated with the Ministry of Health was arranged. Following an official request, WHO sent laboratory experts to consult with national experts performing the tests. That joint undertaking, conducted in late July, confirmed the man’s infection with the H5N1 virus. These findings were further reviewed by a panel of experts, which concluded that the man’s H5N1 infection was now laboratory confirmed. Prior to this announcement, the first official laboratory-confirmed H5N1 case on the Chinese mainland occurred in Hunan Province in October 2005 and was reported to WHO in mid-November 2005. The case has been added to the WHO cumulative table of confirmed cases. Retrospective confirmation of the case brings the cumulative total in China to 20. Of these cases, 13 have been fatal. The Ministry of Health has informed WHO of its intention to strengthen communication mechanisms, and to ensure that more of the country’s research institutes are integrated into the reporting system.

"(' On 23 June 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of one additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The patient is a 51-year-old male from Taizhou City, Zhejiang Province. He had onset of symptoms on 2 June, was admitted to hospital on 6 June, and is currently in a severe condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry. The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: * Strengthen surveillance and situation analysis; * Reinforce case management and medical treatment; * Conduct risk communication with the public and release information. The overall risk assessment has not changed. The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry. At this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. There has been no evidence of sustained human to human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water (http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140123/en/index.html ). Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/live_markets/en/index.html). WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

"(' 30 April 2004 Chinese authorities have today reported test results confirming that the 53-year-old woman who died in Anhui Province on 19 April was infected with the SARS coronavirus. The woman, a medical doctor, was the mother of a 26-year-old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. The student remains hospitalized in Anhui. Since the first case was reported on 22 April, Chinese authorities have confirmed a diagnosis of SARS in five persons (see summary below). Testing continues on another four patients who have SARS-like symptoms and a history of close contact with a known case. Since 22 April, the seven patients in Beijing are now being treated in isolation in a single facility, Ditan Hospital, as a risk reduction strategy. Investigation of the source of the outbreak is presently focused on lapses in biosafety procedures at the National Institute of Virology. The institute was closed on 23 April and its staff were placed in isolation. Summary of cases To date, there have been three generations resulting in nine cases. First generation. The first case is a 26-year-old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province. She worked at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing 7–22 March. Laboratories at the institute are known to be conducting studies using the live SARS coronavirus. Her symptoms developed on 25 March in Anhui. Following onset of symptoms, she travelled twice by train from Anhui to Beijing and back to Anhui. Her SARS infection has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. She is presently hospitalized in isolation in Anhui. A second case who may have acquired infection from a laboratory source is a 31-year-old male researcher at the same virology institute. His symptoms developed on 17 April. He is presently undergoing treatment in isolation at Beijing’s Ditan Hospital. To date, he has not been linked to any other cases. Second generation. The two cases in the second generation are both linked to close personal contact with the postgraduate student. These cases are her 53-year-old mother, whose infection with the SARS coronavirus was confirmed by Chinese authorities today. She is, to date, the only fatal case in the outbreak. The second case is a 20-year-old nurse in Beijing who treated the postgraduate student, from 29 March to 2 April, during her initial hospitalization in Beijing The nurse’s SARS infection has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. She is being treated in isolation at Beijing’s Ditan Hospital. Third generation. Five further cases have all been linked to close contact with the nurse. Three are relatives: her 45-year-old father, her 44-year-old mother, and a 36-year-old aunt. SARS infection in the mother and aunt has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. The fourth case linked to the nurse is a 49-year-old retired female doctor who was admitted to hospital because of another illness and shared a room with the nurse. The retired doctor’s 23-year-old daughter-in-law, who accompanied her at the time of hospital admission, is the fifth case.

"("" 18 June 2008 - Northern Nigeria is currently affected by a new outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), which has begun to spread internationally. In 2008, a nine-fold increase in new cases caused by this serotype has been reported compared with the same period in 2007. This outbreak in northern Nigeria has the potential to cause major international outbreaks, as occurred in 2003-2006. This year, Nigeria accounts for 86% of WPV1 cases in the world. This new outbreak in Nigeria has occurred because upwards of 20% of children remain unimmunized in key high-risk areas for polio in the north of the country. From 2003 to 2006, an outbreak in northern Nigeria led to national and international spread of the disease, eventually re-infecting 20 previously polio-free countries, causing outbreaks in places as far away as Indonesia and Yemen, and resulting in 1,475 cases in these 20 countries. New WPV1 genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria has now been confirmed in Benin (one case, onset 17 April 2008) and the western part of Niger (1 case, in Tillaberry province, close to the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali; onset 11 April 2008). It is from these areas that WPV1 originating from Nigeria spread across west, central and the Horn of Africa in 2003-2004, re-infecting – among others – Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Togo. In addition to international spread of WPV1 from northern Nigeria, wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) originating from northern Nigeria has been reported from Chad (onset of most recent case 13 April 2008). The risk of renewed international spread of polio from Nigeria is increasing due to the intensity of the outbreak in northern Nigeria, the upcoming rainy season which is associated with increased transmission of poliovirus, and the anticipated large-scale population movements for the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) in the second half of 2008. Saudi Arabia has been notified of the increased risk of polio infection to Hajj pilgrims. Nigeria has planned two large-scale rounds of emergency polio immunization in the northern states in July and August 2008. Large-scale emergency polio immunization campaigns were conducted on 13-16 June in high-risk and border areas of Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, followed by additional campaigns in July.

"(' #### Weekly update 4 December 2009 - As of 29 November 2009, worldwide more than 207 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 8768 deaths. As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. ##### Situation update: In the temperate zone* of the northern hemisphere, the early arriving winter influenza season continues to intensify across central Europe and in parts of central, eastern, and southern Asia. Disease activity has peaked and is declining in North America and has either recently peaked or is currently peaking in much of western and northern Europe. In both Canada and the United States, influenza virus circulation remains active and geographically widespread, however, disease activity appears to have peaked in past 3 to 4 weeks. In the United States, deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) continued to increase past the epidemic threshold for the past 8 weeks and cumulative rates of hospitalizations for the current influenza season have exceeded rates seen in recent seasons among all age groups except those aged ≥ 65. In Europe, widespread and intense transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed across most of the continent. In western and northern Europe the peak of disease activity has passed in Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland, Wales); activity may be peaking or plateauing in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Denmark. Influenza activity continues to increase in much of Central Europe in the region between the Baltic and Balkan countries and from Germany to Romania. In Eastern Europe, recent peaks or plateaus in disease activity have also been observed in Ukraine, Belarus, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova. In the Russian Federation, influenza activity remains active and intense in some regions, with an overall increasing trend. A moderate impact on the healthcare system has been reported in parts of Northern and Eastern Europe. Over 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009. In Western and Central Asia, influenza transmission remains active. Disease activity continues to increase in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Iraq, while activity may have peaked in Israel, Jordan, and Afghanistan. In East Asia, increasing ILI** or respiratory disease activity has been reported in Southern China and Japan. A recent decline in activity has been observed in Northern China. In South and Southeast Asia, influenza activity continues to increase in the north-western parts of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia, while activity in the rest of region remain low. In the tropical zone of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining except for focal areas of increasing activity in Jamaica, Venezuela, and Ecuador. In Africa, pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be isolated from all parts of the continent, and there is evidence of continued co-circulation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and seasonal H3N2 viruses. In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza. For more information on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance please see the weekly virology update (Virological surveillance data, below). *Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these two latitudes. **Abbreviations: influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) #### Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 47: 13 July - 22 November 2009) The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services. The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators reported. Information is available for approximately 60 countries each week. Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and completeness of reporting is expected to increase over time. ##### Geographic spread of influenza activity ##### Trend of respiratory diseases activity compared to the previous week ##### Intensity of acute respiratory diseases in the population ##### Impact on health care services ##### Laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 as officially reported to WHO by States Parties to the IHR (2005) as of 29 November 2009 The countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly reported their first pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed cases since the last web update (No.76): None.

"(' 25 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported According to data from the National Centre for Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health in Brazil, 376 cases of cholera have been notified between 12 and 23 November 1998, 24 of which have been laboratory-confirmed. The cases are occurring in the urban area of Cortez municipality (which has a population of approximately 13 000) in the region of Mata-Sul, Pernambuco State, in north- eastern Brazil. The source of contamination is thought to be the Rio Sirinhaém, from which 80% of the water used by the population originates. The Health Department, in collaboration with water and sanitation authorities from the State of Pernambuco are coordinating epidemiological surveillance, health education activities, water chlorination and case management.

"(' Between 9 and 11 April 2017, the National IHR Focal Point of United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported two additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). ### Details of the cases The two cases identified in Abu Dhabi, UAE, were roommates. The case reported to WHO on 9 April 2017 (31-year-old) passed away on 16 April 2017 and the second case reported to WHO on 11 April 2017, identified through tracing of household contacts, is asymptomatic and has been admitted to a negative pressure isolation room on a ward in hospital. The source of infection of the 31-year-old MERS case is under investigation. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing. Detailed information concerning the cases can be found in a separate document (see link below). To date, United Arab Emirates has reported 81 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS. The last case was reported in June 2016 (see Disease Outbreak News published on 21 June 2016). Globally, since September 2012, 1938 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 691 related deaths have been reported to WHO. ### WHO risk assessment MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

"(' 12 August 2004 The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today informed WHO that three recent deaths from influenza-like illness in Viet Nam were caused by infection with avian influenza. These are the first officially reported cases of avian influenza in Viet Nam since late February. The three cases are among a group of patients, admitted to hospitals in Viet Nam between 19 July and 8 August, that have been under investigation by health authorities. Initial tests have identified the virus as belonging to the H5 subtype. Further testing is needed to determine whether the virus belongs to the same H5N1 strain that caused 22 cases, with 15 deaths, in Viet Nam and 12 cases, with 8 deaths, in Thailand earlier this year. To date, H5N1 is the only strain of the H5 subtype known to jump directly from infected poultry to cause illness in humans. Two of the fatal cases occurred in the northern Ha Tay province. The third case occurred in the southern province of Hau Giang. Staff from the WHO country office in Viet Nam will be meeting with the Ministry of Health tomorrow to gather further details about these cases and work out plans for addressing the situation. The government has today announced an initial series of measures aimed at controlling the disease in poultry and preventing further cases in humans. WHO regards it as particularly important that viruses from these cases be made available for further analysis by laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Further studies can help determine whether the virus has mutated and thus yield valuable information about the further evolution of the outbreak, the risks to humans, and the best preventive measures. Studies of the virus are also important in the further development, presently under way, of an effective human vaccine. Thorough epidemiological and clinical investigation of these cases and their contacts is needed to improve understanding of the risks to humans. Earlier this year, Viet Nam reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in 57 of the country’s 64 provinces, resulting in the death or destruction of more than 43 million poultry. After a period of quiescence, Viet Nam reported fresh outbreaks in poultry in July in provinces in northern, central, and southern parts of the country. Outbreaks were also reported in July in China, Indonesia, and Thailand. The confirmation of these latest human cases underscores the risk of virus transmission to humans from infected poultry. This risk will continue as long as outbreaks are occurring in poultry. Of greatest concern is the risk that continuing transmission of the virus to humans will give avian and influenza viruses an opportunity to exchange genes, potentially giving rise to a new virus with pandemic potential.

"("" 18 June 2008 - Northern Nigeria is currently affected by a new outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), which has begun to spread internationally. In 2008, a nine-fold increase in new cases caused by this serotype has been reported compared with the same period in 2007. This outbreak in northern Nigeria has the potential to cause major international outbreaks, as occurred in 2003-2006. This year, Nigeria accounts for 86% of WPV1 cases in the world. This new outbreak in Nigeria has occurred because upwards of 20% of children remain unimmunized in key high-risk areas for polio in the north of the country. From 2003 to 2006, an outbreak in northern Nigeria led to national and international spread of the disease, eventually re-infecting 20 previously polio-free countries, causing outbreaks in places as far away as Indonesia and Yemen, and resulting in 1,475 cases in these 20 countries. New WPV1 genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria has now been confirmed in Benin (one case, onset 17 April 2008) and the western part of Niger (1 case, in Tillaberry province, close to the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali; onset 11 April 2008). It is from these areas that WPV1 originating from Nigeria spread across west, central and the Horn of Africa in 2003-2004, re-infecting – among others – Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Togo. In addition to international spread of WPV1 from northern Nigeria, wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) originating from northern Nigeria has been reported from Chad (onset of most recent case 13 April 2008). The risk of renewed international spread of polio from Nigeria is increasing due to the intensity of the outbreak in northern Nigeria, the upcoming rainy season which is associated with increased transmission of poliovirus, and the anticipated large-scale population movements for the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) in the second half of 2008. Saudi Arabia has been notified of the increased risk of polio infection to Hajj pilgrims. Nigeria has planned two large-scale rounds of emergency polio immunization in the northern states in July and August 2008. Large-scale emergency polio immunization campaigns were conducted on 13-16 June in high-risk and border areas of Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, followed by additional campaigns in July. Disease surveillance is being heightened in 'at-risk' countries, including in those re-infected in 2003-2006. #### For more information "",)",1559,64,2008-06-18,Poliomyelitis in Nigeria and West/Central Africa,6/18/2008,https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2008_06_18-en/,Polio,WPV: WPV1,Benin,BEN,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,2008,4,17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2008_06_18-en,DON-2008-06-18,2008-06-18,"(""\n\n  * Global\n  * Regions\n\nWHO Regional websites\n\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\nWhen autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and\nenter to select.\n\nSelect language  Select language English العربية 中文 Français Русский Español\nPortuguês\n\n  * Home\n\n  * Health Topics\n\n  * All topics »\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Resources »\n    * Fact sheets\n    * Facts in pictures\n    * Multimedia\n    * Publications\n    * Questions & answers\n    * Tools and toolkits\n\n  * Popular »\n    * Air pollution\n    * Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n    * Hepatitis\n    * Monkeypox\n\n  * Countries\n\n  * All countries\xa0»\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n\n  * Regions »\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Europe\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Western Pacific\n\n  * WHO in countries »\n    * Statistics\n    * Cooperation strategies\n    * Ukraine emergency\n\n  * Newsroom\n\n  * All news »\n    * News releases\n    * Statements\n    * Campaigns\n    * Commentaries\n    * Events\n    * Feature stories\n    * Speeches\n    * Spotlights\n    * Newsletters\n    * Photo library\n    * Media distribution list\n\n  * Headlines\xa0»\n\n  * Emergencies\n\n  * Focus on »\n    * Afghanistan crisis\n    * COVID-19 pandemic\n    * Northern Ethiopia crisis\n    * Syria crisis\n    * Ukraine emergency\n    * Monkeypox outbreak\n    * Greater Horn of Africa crisis\n\n  * Latest »\n    * Disease Outbreak News\n    * Travel advice\n    * Situation reports\n    * Weekly Epidemiological Record\n\n  * WHO in emergencies »\n    * Surveillance\n    * Research\n    * Funding\n    * Partners\n    * Operations\n    * Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee\n    * WHO's Health Emergency Appeal 2023\n\n  * Data\n\n  * Data at WHO »\n    * Global Health Estimates\n    * Health SDGs\n    * Mortality Database\n    * Data collections\n\n  * Dashboards »\n    * COVID-19 Dashboard\n    * Triple Billion Dashboard\n    * Health Inequality Monitor\n\n  * Highlights »\n    * Global Health Observatory\n    * SCORE\n    * Insights and visualizations\n    * Data collection tools\n\n  * Reports »\n    * World Health Statistics 2022\n    * COVID excess deaths\n    * DDI IN FOCUS: 2022\n\n  * About WHO\n\n  * About WHO »\n    * People\n    * Teams\n    * Structure\n    * Partnerships and collaboration\n    * Collaborating centres\n    * Networks, committees and advisory groups\n    * Transformation\n\n  * Our Work »\n    * General Programme of Work\n    * WHO Academy\n    * Activities\n    * Initiatives\n\n  * Funding »\n    * Investment case\n    * WHO Foundation\n\n  * Accountability »\n    * Audit\n    * Programme Budget\n    * Financial statements\n    * Programme Budget Portal\n    * Results Report\n\n  * Governance »\n    * World Health Assembly\n    * Executive Board\n    * Election of Director-General\n    * Governing Bodies website\n    * Member States Portal\n\n  * Home/\n  * Disease Outbreak News/\n  * Item/\n  * Poliomyelitis in Nigeria and West/Central Africa\n\n#  2008 - Nigeria\n\n18 June 2008\n\n18 June 2008 - Northern Nigeria is currently affected by a new outbreak of\nwild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), which has begun to spread internationally.

In 2008, a nine-fold increase in new cases caused by this serotype has been reported compared with the same period in 2007. This outbreak in northern Nigeria has the potential to cause major international outbreaks, as occurred in 2003-2006. This year, Nigeria accounts for 86% of WPV1 cases in the world. This new outbreak in Nigeria has occurred because upwards of 20% of children remain unimmunized in key high-risk areas for polio in the north of the country. From 2003 to 2006, an outbreak in northern Nigeria led to national and international spread of the disease, eventually re-infecting 20 previously polio-free countries, causing outbreaks in places as far away as Indonesia and Yemen, and resulting in 1,475 cases in these 20 countries. New WPV1 genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria has now been confirmed in Benin (one case, onset 17 April 2008) and the western part of Niger (1 case, in Tillaberry province, close to the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali; onset 11 April 2008). It is from these areas that WPV1 originating from Nigeria spread across west, central and the Horn of Africa in 2003-2004, re-infecting – among others – Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Togo. In addition to international spread of WPV1 from northern Nigeria, wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) originating from northern Nigeria has been reported from Chad (onset of most recent case 13 April 2008). The risk of renewed international spread of polio from Nigeria is increasing due to the intensity of the outbreak in northern Nigeria, the upcoming rainy season which is associated with increased transmission of poliovirus, and the anticipated large-scale population movements for the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) in the second half of 2008. Saudi Arabia has been notified of the increased risk of polio infection to Hajj pilgrims.

"(' 30 October 2008 - On 22 August the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Central African Republic reported a laboratory confirmed case of yellow fever. This is the second Yellow fever event reported by the Central African Republic in 2008. The case has been laboratory confirmed for Yellow fever by the Institut Pasteur, Dakar. The initial case is a 32-year old male from Ngotto village, sub-prefecture of Boda, Prefecture of La Lobaye, who presented with symptoms of fever and jaundice. He is alive and continues to recover from his illness. The case was detected by the national Yellow fever surveillance system. The outbreak investigation team evaluated 34 contacts in Boda sub-prefecture. Four presented with symptoms of fever or jaundice and the other 30 were asymptomatic. On the basis of the assessment of the outbreak situation, it was decided to vaccinate 183,992 people against Yellow fever in the four sub-prefectures of the Prefecture of La Lobaye (Mbaiki, Mongoumba, Boda and Bogonda) and part of the neighbouring Prefecture of La Sangha (sub-prefecture of Bambio). The Prefecture of La Lobaye is not an endemic area for Yellow fever. In March 2008, the Central African Republic reported some Yellow fever cases in the North West of the country and a mass vaccination campaign against Yellow fever was conducted successfully in the region. In response to the outbreak, the MoH has made a request for yellow fever vaccines and operational costs for the preventative mass vaccination campaign from the GAVI funded Global Emergency Stockpile for Yellow fever vaccine, managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG).

"(' As of 14 September, fourteen autochthonous confirmed cases of chikungunya have been diagnosed in Italy, six in Rome and eight in the coastal area of Anzio (Lazio Region). There are additional cases being investigated. The date of onset of symptoms of the first case was on 5 August 2017. The dates of onset of the latest cases are between 25 August and 7 September 2017. ### Public health response The following public health measures described in the Italian National Chikungunya Surveillance and Response Plan are implemented: * Disinfestation and vector control measures in the Anzio and Rome areas; * Communication to the population about chikungunya and information on protection against mosquito bites. Ministry of Health’s website has pages about chikungunya which can be found at the link below; * Measures to prevent transmission through blood transfusion; * Information and guidelines for health care practitioners to manage patients. The National Health Institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) issued a public statement on 8 September 2017 concerning the outbreak. ### WHO risk assessment There is a risk for further transmission. This is due to: * Aedes albopictus being established throughout the Mediterranean basin; * this vector having demonstrated the capacity to sustain outbreaks of chikungunya in the past; and * the area of the current case being highly populated and touristic particularly in summer months. The disease mostly occurs in Africa, Asia, Americas and the Indian subcontinent. In 2007, transmission was reported for the first time in Europe, in the Emilia Romagna region of north-eastern Italy. There were 217 laboratory confirmed cases during this outbreak and it demonstrated that mosquito-borne outbreaks by Aedes albopictus are possible in Europe. Currently, there is another ongoing autochthonous outbreak in Var Department, France that started in early August 2017. ### WHO advice #### Personal protection Basic precautions should be taken by people within and travelling to this area of Italy. These include wearing long sleeves and pants, use of repellents, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting vectors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin. People should sleep under a mosquito bed net and use air conditioning or window screens to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting. #### Vector control The Aedes albopictus species thrives in a wide range of water-filled containers, including tree-holes and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as unused vehicle tires, saucers beneath plant pots, rain water barrels and cisterns, and catch basins. Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of these natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected communities, and strengthening monitoring of the vector mosquito. During outbreaks, indoor space spraying with insecticides may be performed to kill flying mosquitoes along with killing the immature larvae in water-filled containers through source reduction. ### About chikungunya Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. Hence the virus can cause acute, subacute or chronic disease. There is no cure for the disease and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.

"(' 29 May 2003 Situation in China China has today reported 3 new probable SARS cases, all in Beijing. All 3 patients had previously been classified as suspect cases and were already hospitalized. WHO is cautiously optimistic that outbreaks in mainland China are being brought under control in provinces with good surveillance and reporting systems and good infection control in hospitals. WHO officials in China report that the use of air conditioning in public places is being discontinued in an effort to prevent the further spread of SARS. WHO has no evidence to date that air-conditioning could play a role in spreading the SARS virus. All evidence indicates that the predominant mode of spread is through close person-to-person contact with droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. For the purpose of infection control, and exclusively in hospital settings, WHO does recommend turning off air-conditioning and opening windows to provide ventilation. This option is recommended only when the preferred options of negative pressure rooms or an independent air supply and exhaust system cannot be met. A WHO expert who recently assessed the SARS situation in Shanghai reports that the city has taken many steps to stem the spread of SARS. While the screening of air passengers is progressing well, implementation of a similar level of screening at Shanghai’s bus and railway stations is proving logistically more difficult. Local authorities are also implementing numerous temperature checks; these may occasionally be performed at an excessive frequency. WHO teams in China are still investigating how best to implement monitoring procedures in the country’s rural areas. Local officials are prepared to adopt a community-based surveillance system. However, exactly which measures will prove most effective remains to be determined. WHO teams hope to visit other SARS “hot spots” in China, such as Tianjin and Shanxi.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. Globally, WHO has been notified of 1059 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 394 related deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed.

Droplet precautions should be\nadded to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with\nsymptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye\nprotection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of\nMERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing\naerosol generating procedures.\n\nUntil more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure,\nchronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at\nhigh risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection.

The cases were reported in previous DONs on 23 February (cases n. 2, 35), on 26 February (case n. 3) and on 6 March (cases n. 2, 4, 8). Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. Globally, WHO has been notified of 1059 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 394 related deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

"(' ### China joins WHO collaborative network Disease Outbreak Reported 28 March 2003 At a press briefing held today in Beijing, the head of the WHO investigative team in China, John MacKenzie of Australia, announced several steps forward in the government’s commitment to join international efforts to contain a newly emerging infectious disease. (see Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing, Beijing, China) The WHO team of five experts arrived in Beijing last Sunday to investigate an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002. Experts have strongly suspected a link between the southern China outbreak and current cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that first surfaced in mid-February in Asia. The disease has since spread to 13 countries on three continents. The WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Health, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, and officials from Guangdong Province. In the initial stage of the investigation, the WHO team compared case definitions used in China with those used by WHO to identify SARS and concluded that most cases of atypical pneumonia reported in China from mid- November until 28 February were “indeed cases of SARS.” As reported by the WHO team, Chinese authorities have now agreed to join the WHO collaborative effort to contain the SARS outbreak and prevent its further international spread. Chinese institutes will be selected within days to participate in three global electronic networks set up by WHO to facilitate rapid international collaboration on SARS-related scientific and medical problems. Networks of experts are working to further identify and characterize the SARS virus, develop better tools for diagnosis and management, and understand how the disease is transmitted and what works best to prevent its spread. WHO authorities have also been given access to meticulous records kept on Chinese SARS cases. As China, according to statistics released earlier this week, has experienced the largest number of SARS cases of any country in the world, these data are expected to take understanding of the new disease, and particularly its origins, a major step forward. One of the greatest challenges in containing new diseases is the lack of understanding of their behaviour as they emerge. The Chinese data, which also cover the longest time frame, are further expected to improve understanding of how the disease spreads from person to person and why some outbreaks appear to have much milder cases than others. Progress in identifying the causative agent, now being reported by members in a WHO global network of collaborating laboratories, indicates that the causative agent is a new virus in humans that may have jumped the species barrier from its animal host or mutated in ways that have given it more lethal properties. Chinese data may help solve the riddle of how the new virus first began to cause disease in humans. China released new figures on the Guangdong outbreak on Wednesday, significantly increasing the global cumulative total. On Thursday, officials issued the first reports of cases and deaths in ongoing outbreaks in Beijing province and in the northern province of Shanxi. China has further agreed today to begin providing up-to-date electronic reports of SARS cases throughout China. These reports will be submitted electronically as official reports to WHO from the Ministry of Health. According to members of the WHO team in China, the government may need a few days to get the new nationwide system of daily electronic reports in operation. Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 77 cases. No new deaths have occurred. No reports were received from China today due to the decision to introduce a new system of nationwide daily electronic reporting to WHO. With 58 new cases, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area. Other countries reporting new cases include Canada (1), China, Taiwan (4), Singapore (8), and the United States of America (6). Viet Nam reported no new cases and no new deaths for the fifth day in a row. WHO experts believe that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate introduction of stringent infection control procedures may have held further transmission at bay. Some patients recovering To date, 19 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals in Hong Kong, 17 from Viet Nam, and 25 from Singapore.

"(' 27 February 2006 The Ministry of Health in China has reported two additional laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Both patients are in critical conditions. The first patient is a 9-year-old girl from the eastern province of Zhejiang. She developed symptoms on 10 February. Symptom onset followed a visit to relatives in the adjacent province of Anhui. No animal outbreaks have been reported in Zhejiang Province since 2004. The second patient is a 26-year-old female farmer from Anhui Province. She developed symptoms on 11 February following contact with diseased poultry. Local agricultural officials have reported isolation of the H5N1 virus in samples from dead poultry in her neighbourhood. To date, China has reported 14 laboratory-confirmed cases.

"(' The National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China has notified WHO of two laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus. ### Details of the cases * On 21 November 2016, a human case of infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus was reported in a 47-year-old female living in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province who developed symptoms on 18 November 2016. She was admitted to hospital on the same day in critical condition. On 20 November 2016, the case was confirmed as infected with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus by laboratory testing, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological findings. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing. * On 1 December 2016, an additional human case of infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus was reported in a 30-year-old female living in Guangxi Province who developed the disease on 8 November 2016. She was admitted to hospital on 18 November 2016, and at the time of notification, was in critical condition. She had a history of exposure to dead poultry prior to illness onset. 127 close contacts are being monitored, and at the time of notification, none of the close contacts have experienced symptoms. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing. ### Public health response The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: * Collecting sample from the cases and conducting laboratory tests. * Intensified treatment of the cases; conducting epidemiological investigation of the cases; tracking and managing close contacts, and medical observation of close contacts. * Strengthening sentinel surveillance of pneumonia of unknown causes and regular influenza; strengthening etiological surveillance of influenza/avian influenza viruses. ### WHO risk assessment WHO, through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), continues to closely monitor the avian influenza A(H5N6) virus and other zoonotic influenza events. So far, the overall public health risk associated with the avian influenza A(H5N6) virus has not changed. Avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses have caused severe infection in humans, and thus far, human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human-to-human transmission. However the specific risk associated with the virus strains infecting the reported cases will be assessed when the viruses are received and characterized in the GISRS laboratories. The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time. WHO continues to assess the epidemiological situation and conduct further risk assessment based on the latest information. ### WHO advice WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

She was admitted to hospital on the same day in critical condition. On 20 November 2016, the case was confirmed as infected with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus by laboratory testing, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological findings. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing. \n  * On 1 December 2016, an additional human case of infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus was reported in a 30-year-old female living in Guangxi Province who developed the disease on 8 November 2016.

Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and\nwater, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this\nevent, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

"(' 29 February 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported The outbreak of listeriosis reported in France began during the second half of December 1999. Twenty six cases including 7 deaths have so far been reported and the number of cases is expected to increase slightly in the next few days given the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 2 months). The Ministry of Health issued a press release stating that a pork tongue in jelly is suspected to be the origin of the outbreak, on the basis of case-control study data. However, the name of the brand has not yet been identified and the Pasteur Institute in Paris is screening Listeria monocytogenes food isolates to detect the epidemic clone. Food contaminated with L. monocytogenes is a significant source of illness and death worldwide. The case-fatality rate in recent outbreaks and sporadic cases is around 20%-30%. From early August 1998 to 6 January 1999, at least 50 cases caused by a rare strain of the bacterium L. monocytogenes, serotype 4b, were reported in the United States. Six adults died and 2 pregnant women had spontaneous abortions.

"(' On 18 June 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for Brazil reported the isolation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from sewage samples collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport, in Campinas municipality in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Virus has been detected in the sewage only; sewage samples collected from the same site subsequent to the detection of WPV1 have been either negative or only positive for Sabin strains or non-polio enteroviruses; to date no case of paralytic polio has been reported. The isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance testing of sewage water; there is no evidence of transmission of WPV1. Genetic sequencing indicated a close match with a strain of WPV1 that was recently isolated from a case of polio in Equatorial Guinea. Additional epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The Americas Region has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1991 and Brazil since 1989. There is no indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus reported in Brazil since 1989. Brazil health authorities have enhanced their surveillance activity aimed to detect transmission of WPV1 and potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un-immunized persons. The vaccination coverage against polio in São Paulo State and Campinas municipality have been higher than 95% in the routine immunization program. The last national OPV campaign was conducted in June 2013. The campaign for this year is planned in November 2014 at the national level and the target group is children 6 months to less than 5 years of age with OPV. Specimens collected through environmental surveillance at this and other sites in Brazil since 1994 have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV. Given the high levels of population immunity indicated by the high routine immunization coverage and implementation of periodic vaccination campaigns in the area — no evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented — the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus from Brazil as very low. Given the ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, low national routine immunization coverage, and the inconsistent quality of the initial outbreak response vaccination campaigns, WHO assesses the risk of additional exportation from Equatorial Guinea as high. ### WHO note Brazil was not re-infected with WPV; the country was exposed to a poliovirus importation. The environmental surveillance system had the capacity to detect the poliovirus in sewage samples and the high immunity appears to have prevented transmission. ### WHO travel recommendations WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Brazil has detected a poliovirus importation event. Based on current evidence, the country is not considered polio-affected.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 7 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in previous DONs on 9 September (case no. 7, 15, 22), on 8 September (case no. 1, 6, 8) and on 21 August (case no. 11). Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,564 laboratory- confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 551 related deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems.

This hospital has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 5 September. Currently, she is in stable condition in home isolation. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the MERS-CoV cases in the hospital is ongoing. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. * A 48-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 29 August and, on 4 September, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 5 September. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 7 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in previous DONs on 9 September (case no. 7, 15, 22), on 8 September (case no. 1, 6, 8) and on 21 August (case no. 11). Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,564 laboratory- confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 551 related deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems. ',)",14056,17-september-2015-mers-saudi-arabia-en
"("" 8 October 2013 - The Ministry of Health of Cameroon carried out a yellow fever mass vaccination campaign with a reported 94% coverage of the targeted population of 663 900 in 13 health districts considered to be at high risk of yellow fever. The vaccination campaign was carried out between 27 August to 1 September 2013 in the Littoral Region, following laboratory-confirmation of two cases with yellow fever in the area in April 2013. The index case was a 43-year-old woman from Ndom Health district who became ill on 15 March 2013. The patients were laboratory confirmed at the Institute Pasteur of Cameroon by IgM ELISA (antibody) test, which was followed by the seroneutralizing test (PRNT) for yellow fever by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever. In 2012, suspected cases were reported from the South-West area which includes North-West, South-West and West regions. These cases were identified as part of the surveillance system which identifies patients with fever and jaundice within the 14 days of onset. WHO country office has been working with the health authorities in the field investigation and response to the outbreak. There is ongoing surveillance for yellow fever in the country. GAVI Alliance and the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG1) supported the reactive mass vaccination campaign which covered over 663 900 people in 13 health districts considered to be at high risk for yellow fever, namely Dibombari, Edea, Loum, Manjo, Manoka, Mbanga, Melong, Ndom, Ngambe, Nkondjock, Nkongsamba, Pouma and Yabass. * * * 1The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund. It is represented by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and WHO, which also serves as the Secretariat.

"(' On 14 October 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. ### Details of the cases The cases are a 55-year-old female and a 53-year-old male, with onset dates of 18 September and 21 September, respectively. Both cases had exposure to poultry and live poultry markets. No epidemiological link between the cases was reported. The cases were reported from 2 municipalities (Huzhou city and Jinhua city) in Zhejiang province. ### Public health response The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: * strengthen outbreak surveillance and situation analysis; * reinforce all efforts on medical treatment; and * conduct risk communication with the public and dissemination of information. WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Based on the information received thus far, the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed. As of June 2015, FAO reported continued AI A(H7N9) virus detections in the animal population in multiple provinces in China, indicating that the virus persists in the poultry population. If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the human case number may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans. ### WHO advice WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

"(' 13 November 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported As of 12 November 2002, Health Canada has reported a total number of 141 human cases of West Nile virus infection: 84 suspected cases, 57 confirmed cases, including 2 deaths. One confirmed case is resident in the province of Alberta, one suspected case and 7 confirmed cases are resident in the province of Quebec, and the remaining 83 suspected cases and 49 confirmed cases are resident in the province of Ontario (see previous report).

"("" ### Guinea As of 9 April, a cumulative total of 158 clinically compatible cases, including 101 deaths have been officially reported. Laboratory investigations continue at the Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar laboratory in Conakry (65 samples tested, of which 38 are positive by PCR for ebolavirus) and at the European Union Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) team in Guekedou (38 samples tested/28 positive). A total of 66 clinical cases have been laboratory confirmed (42%), while 87 of the remaining clinical cases are classified as probable cases and 4 as suspected cases. Twenty-four of the 101 deaths have been laboratory confirmed. Six districts of Guinea have reported patients – Conakry (20 patients, all laboratory confirmed), Guekedou (96 cases/32 confirmed), Macenta (28 cases/12 confirmed), Kissidougou (9 cases/1 confirmed) and Dabola and Djingaraye combined (5 cases/1 confirmed). The date of onset of the most recently identified suspected clinical cases in Conakry and Guekedou was 8 April. One additional health-care worker (HCW) has been reported since the 7 April update, bringing the total to 15 (10 laboratory confirmed and 5 probable cases). Medical observation is continuing for 488 contacts while 453 have been discharged from follow-up. No new contacts were identified since 8 April. Guinea’s Ministry of Health (MOH) Clinical Care sub-committee has agreed on a program of assessment and training in major hospitals and other clinical locations in Conakry. WHO continues to support HCW training in case management and infection prevention and control (ICP). ICP has been reinforced in the Kipé and Donka Hospitals, Conakry, and in the prefectural hospitals of Guekedou, Macenta and Kissidougou. Outreach clinical services to affected communities are also being provided by teams of clinicians from the Guinea MOH, MSF and WHO. ### Liberia As of 10 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a cumulative total of 5 laboratory confirmed cases and 20 suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case is 6 April, with 6 patients currently hospitalised. Lofa County accounts for 32% of the clinical cases reported to date (4 laboratory confirmed and 6 suspected cases) followed by Margibi County (27%, 1 confirmed and 5 suspected cases). Other Counties at risk include Bong (4 suspected cases) and Nimba (3 suspected cases). Montserrado and Grand Cape Mount Counties have each reported one suspected case. At present 32 contacts remain under medical observation. The cumulative number of 12 deaths are being attributed to EVD; Lofa (9), Nimba (1), Margibi (1) and Montserrado (1). All 5 laboratory confirmed cases have died. Laboratory confirmed deaths have occurred in Lofa County (4) and Margibi County (1). The MOHSW is convening daily meetings of the national task force under the leadership of the Chief Medical Officer. Daily coordination meetings with partners are also held by local government authorities in Monrovia, Lofa, Bong, Margibi, Nimba and Cape Mount Counties. Response activities continue with an emphasis on HCW training, risk communications, including daily press briefings, airing of EVD public education messages in local dialects and a variety of social mobilisation activities. Local leaders are engaged in public awareness campaigns through the network of traditional and religious leaders and traditional healers. ### Mali As of 10 April, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Mali reports a cumulative total of 6 suspected cases after 2 suspected cases tested negative for ebolavirus and other viral haemorrhagic fever viruses in assays conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Clinical samples have been collected from all of the suspected cases to date. The samples from the remaining 6 suspected cases have been dispatched to the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, for testing. The patients who previously tested negative have been released from medical follow-up and counselling has been provided to their families. The isolation facility at the Centre National d’Appui à la lutte contre les Maladies (CNAM), Bamako, designed for the management of cases of Lassa fever, is receiving the suspected cases of EVD. Suspected cases have also been reported from Kourémalé (2) and Bankoumana (1) in Koulikoro Region of Mali. The MOH is also working with response partners to strengthen: social mobilisation and public risk communications about EVD, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and resource mobilisation, including access to additional personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs and essential medicines. ### Sierra Leone Although the epidemiological situation in Sierra Leone remains unchanged, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) continues to lead intensive EVD preparedness activities. Seven teams, each comprising of a director from the MOHS, a program officer of the Disease Prevention and Control directorate and a program officer from the national Health Education program have been dispatched to each of districts bordering Liberia and Guinea (Kambia, Kenema, Koinadugu, Kailahun, Bombali, Pujehun and Kono districts) to assess district preparedness with local authorities, including community-wide approaches to EVD preparedness and response and to preposition supplies. Planned activities include training of senior medical and nursing staff at the Kenema Government Hospital’s Lassa Fever Unit and the training of port health and surveillance officers in Freetown. ### WHO's response WHO, in collaboration with technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has deployed field laboratory support, and continues to identify and deploy experts in anthropology, epidemiology and data management, outbreak logistics, clinical case management and infection prevention and control, social mobilisation, risk communications and outbreak coordination to support the response in all of the affected countries. Over 50 experts have been deployed to date and response supplies, including PPE and a variety of EVD communication and education materials for local adaptation, have been dispatched to affected and neighbouring countries. As EVD in West Africa continues to evolve, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and ongoing laboratory investigations. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Mali or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

"(' 19 July 2013 - The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has reported an additional two laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The first patient is a 41-year-old man from Riyadh and the second patient is a 59-year-old woman from Al Ahsa governorate. Both of them are currently hospitalized. Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 90 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 45 deaths. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients’ lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhea, in patients who are immunocompromised. Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

"("" 1 May 2014 - On 25 and 28 April 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 3 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. #### Details of the cases reported on 25 April 2014 are as follows: * A 51 year-old man from Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province. He became ill on 13 April, was admitted to a hospital on 18 April, and is currently in a critical condition. Information on exposure is currently not available. * A 75 year-old woman from Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province. She became ill on 12 April, was admitted to a hospital on 17 April, and is currently in a critical condition. She had a history of exposure to poultry. #### Details of the cases reported on 28 April 2014 are as follows: * A 55 year-old man from Lu’an City, Anhui Province. He became ill on 15 April, was admitted to a hospital on 23 April, and is currently in a severe condition. He had a history of exposure to poultry. The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: * strengthen surveillance and situation analysis; * reinforce case management and treatment; and * conduct risk communication with the public and release information. ### Current risk assessment The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links'). The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. ### WHO advice WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

"(' Between July and mid-October 2017, a total of 71 suspected yellow fever cases were reported in São Paulo State, Brazil. Of these, two were confirmed, six are under investigation, and 63 were ruled out. The two confirmed cases (one of which was fatal) were reported from Itatiba from 17 September through 7 October 2017. From July to early November, 580 epizootics in non-human primates (NHPs) were reported in São Paulo State, with an increase in the number of cases reported from 10 September 2017. Of these, 120 were confirmed for yellow fever, 233 are under investigation, 74 were classified as undetermined, and 153 were ruled out. The highest number of epizootics was registered in the health surveillance area of Campinas, where epizootic episodes were reported for the first time in the municipalities of Campo Limpo Paulista (in the week ending 23 September 2017), Atibaia (in the week ending 30 September 2017), and Jarinu (in the week ending 14 October 2017). Epizootics in NHPs were also recently reported in large parks located within the urban area of São Paulo City (in the week ending 14 October 2017). ### Public health response The detection of two confirmed yellow fever human cases and epizootics in the state of São Paulo, as well as confirmed yellow fever epizootics in the urban area of São Paulo City, prompted national authorities to begin vaccination campaigns in areas previously considered not at risk for yellow fever transmission. In addition, state and municipality health authorities are strengthening health care services and carrying out risk communication activities. ### WHO risk assessment These are the first human cases of yellow fever that have been reported in Brazil since June 2017. These cases, alongside the occurrence of epizootics in the urban area of São Paulo City and in municipalities that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, are a public health concern. Although Brazilian health authorities have swiftly implemented a series of public health measures in response to this event, including mass vaccination campaigns, it may take some time to reach optimal coverage in these areas given the large number of susceptible individuals. Currently, the number of unvaccinated people in São Paulo City remains high at around 10 million. If yellow fever transmission continues to spread to areas that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, ensuring the availability of vaccine and implementing control measures would pose significant challenges. To date, there has been no evidence of transmission by Aedes aegypti in relation to this outbreak in Brazil which began in 2016. Although entomological studies conducted in selected municipalities of São Paulo revealed low levels of Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus infestation (pupa index range: 0% – 3.1%), the risk of sustained arbovirus transmission is ever present. The risk of spread at the regional level is considered to be low given the high vaccination coverage in neighbouring countries; however, the detection of a human case of yellow fever in Oiapoque, the border river between French Guiana and Brazil in August 2017 by French health authorities indicates that the risk of regional spread exists. The risk at the global level is considered to be low and limited only to unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas. Travelers who return home while infected with yellow fever virus may increase the risk of establishing local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and assess the risk according to the latest available information. ### WHO advice Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil includes receiving yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days prior to traveling, following measures to avoid mosquito bites, and being aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs. WHO continues to promote health seeking behaviour when travelers are in and when they have returned from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission. As per Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (2005), a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life- long protection against yellow fever disease. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine are not needed. The WHO Secretariat does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with/to Brazil according to the information currently available for this event.

The highest number of epizootics was registered in the health surveillance area of Campinas, where epizootic episodes were reported for the first time in the municipalities of Campo Limpo Paulista (in the week ending 23 September 2017), Atibaia (in the week ending 30 September 2017), and Jarinu (in the week ending 14 October 2017). Epizootics in NHPs were also recently reported in large parks located within the urban area of São Paulo City (in the week ending 14 October 2017). ### Public health response The detection of two confirmed yellow fever human cases and epizootics in the state of São Paulo, as well as confirmed yellow fever epizootics in the urban area of São Paulo City, prompted national authorities to begin vaccination campaigns in areas previously considered not at risk for yellow fever transmission. In addition, state and municipality health authorities are strengthening health care services and carrying out risk communication activities. ### WHO risk assessment These are the first human cases of yellow fever that have been reported in Brazil since June 2017. These cases, alongside the occurrence of epizootics in the urban area of São Paulo City and in municipalities that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, are a public health concern. Although Brazilian health authorities have swiftly implemented a series of public health measures in response to this event, including mass vaccination campaigns, it may take some time to reach optimal coverage in these areas given the large number of susceptible individuals. Currently, the number of unvaccinated people in São Paulo City remains high at around 10 million. If yellow fever transmission continues to spread to areas that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, ensuring the availability of vaccine and implementing control measures would pose significant challenges. To date, there has been no evidence of transmission by Aedes aegypti in relation to this outbreak in Brazil which began in 2016. Although entomological studies conducted in selected municipalities of São Paulo revealed low levels of Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus infestation (pupa index range: 0% – 3.1%), the risk of sustained arbovirus transmission is ever present. The risk of spread at the regional level is considered to be low given the high vaccination coverage in neighbouring countries; however, the detection of a human case of yellow fever in Oiapoque, the border river between French Guiana and Brazil in August 2017 by French health authorities indicates that the risk of regional spread exists. The risk at the global level is considered to be low and limited only to unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas. Travelers who return home while infected with yellow fever virus may increase the risk of establishing local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and assess the risk according to the latest available information. ### WHO advice Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil includes receiving yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days prior to traveling, following measures to avoid mosquito bites, and being aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs. WHO continues to promote health seeking behaviour when travelers are in and when they have returned from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission. As per Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (2005), a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life- long protection against yellow fever disease. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine are not needed. The WHO Secretariat does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with/to Brazil according to the information currently available for this event.

"(' On 1 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Islamic Republic of Iran notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. ### Details of the case are as follows: A 61-year- old male from Kahnooj city developed symptoms on 18 March and was admitted to hospital in Kahnooj city on 26 March. The patient was transferred to another hospital in Kerman city on 28 March. He has no comorbidities. On 13 March, the patient had contact with two individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) who returned from Umrah on 10 March. He has no history of contact with other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. The patient was discharged from hospital on 27 April. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case. Also, investigation of the two ILI cases is ongoing. The two ILI cases have no history of exposure to any of the known risk factors while performing Umrah. Globally, WHO has been notified of 1112 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 422 related deaths. ### WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed.

WHO continues to closely monitor the H7N9 situation and conduct risk assessment. So far, the overall risk associated with the H7N9 virus has not changed. ### WHO advice WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

"(' 29 October 2013 - WHO has been informed of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Qatar. The patient is a 23-year-old man who was identified as a close contact of a previously laboratory-confirmed case as part of the epidemiological investigation. He is a worker in the animal barn owned by the previously laboratory-confirmed case. The man developed mild symptoms of illness and is in good condition. Preliminary investigations revealed that he did not recently travel outside the country. Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 145 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 62 deaths. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms. Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

"(' On 24 January 2017, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through their Health Alert Network (HAN) publication, reported 8 cases of infection with Seoul virus in the states of Wisconsin (n=2) and Illinois (n=6). The first two cases were reported in early December 2016, when two home-based pet rat breeders in Wisconsin State developed an acute febrile illness, later confirmed as Seoul virus infection. Rats (Rattus norvegicus) at some facilities also tested positive for Seoul virus. Human infection with Seoul virus is not commonly found in the United States; this virus family also includes Sin Nombre virus, which is the most common hantavirus causing disease in the United States. This is the first known outbreak associated with pet rats in the United States. To date, a total of 11 people have been infected in the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Colorado. Two of the individuals were hospitalized. Seoul virus infection was also confirmed in pet rats from ratteries in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. Follow-up investigations indicate that potentially infected rats may have been distributed or received in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. All investigations to date have indicated that the affected breeding facilities are limited to the pet rat trade. None of these ratteries supply (or have supplied) rats to research facilities. In addition, follow-up investigations by the United States CDC and public health officials in Canada indicate that rats have been exchanged between the United States and Canada. According to the Canada IHR national focal point report of 10 February 2017, the Canadian rat breeding facilities under investigation exported rats to the United States and also imported rats from affected United States facilities. As of 10 February 2017, three positive human cases for the Hemorrhagic Fever Renal Syndrome (HFRS) group of hantaviruses, which includes Seoul, Hantaan, Puumala and Dobrava viruses, have been identified by serology in Canada. No serious illness was reported in these individuals. Two of the cases breed rats, and the third had contact with rats. Further laboratory testing and virus characterization is ongoing. Further epidemiologic investigation and testing of rats is planned. ### Public health response Health authorities both in the United States and Canada are implementing the following measures to respond to the outbreak: Canada * Further laboratory testing and virus characterization to confirm Seoul virus exposure in humans. * Assessment of associated pet rat breeding facilities. * Further epidemiological investigation and testing of rats. United States of America * The United States CDC and State Health Departments are collaborating to investigate the outbreak. * Depopulation carried out in some affected ratteries. * Investigations regarding the importation and exportation of the rats before the detection of the outbreak ongoing. ### Information on Seoul virus Seoul virus is a type of hantavirus that is transmitted from rats to humans after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents, or after exposure to dust from their nests or bedding. Transmission may also occur from rat bites or when contaminated materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto mucous membranes. For Seoul virus, the natural host is the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the black rat (Rattus rattus). This virus has been found in both pet rats and wild rat populations around the world. The incubation period varies from 1 to 8 weeks; however, most individuals develop symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure. Seoul virus infection symptoms can range from mild to severe. In the severe form of the disease, patients can exhibit bleeding and renal syndromes. Inapparent infections can also occur. Seoul virus infection is not transmissible from human to human. There is no effective treatment available for Seoul virus infection. ### WHO risk assessment Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is the severe form of the infection with Seoul virus. The case fatality rate (CFR) among humans who develop HFRS due to Seoul virus ranges from 1-2%. Of the 11 cases reported in the United States so far, two were hospitalized and none have died. Although the three HFRS cases in Canada are still under investigation, there is some evidence of an epidemiological link to the United States Seoul virus outbreak. There is no available information on further distribution of the infected rats outside of the United States and Canada. Rats do not show symptoms of disease when they are infected with Seoul virus. Once infected, rats can continue to shed virus throughout their lives, potentially infecting other rats and humans. The United States CDC is working with state health departments in the United States and others to investigate the outbreak of Seoul virus infections in pet rats and humans, to trace shipments and transport of rats, some of which may be infected with Seoul virus, to better understand how the virus entered the pet trade and to interrupt transmission of Seoul virus to other rats and humans. Because there is presently no effective treatment for Seoul virus infection, preventing infections in people is important. If infected rodents have contact with local rat populations, the infection with Seoul virus could spread to non-infected rodents and consequently change the prevalence of this zoonotic disease, both in rodents and in humans. ### WHO advice International pet trade has the potential to spread and cause emerging or re- emerging disease in humans. WHO encourages State Parties to developed and maintain the capacity to detect, and report similar events.

Human\ninfection with Seoul virus is not commonly found in the United States; this\nvirus family also includes Sin Nombre virus, which is the most common\nhantavirus causing disease in the United States. This is the first known\noutbreak associated with pet rats in the United States.\n\nTo date, a total of 11 people have been infected in the states of Wisconsin,\nIllinois, and Colorado. Two of the individuals were hospitalized. Seoul virus\ninfection was also confirmed in pet rats from ratteries in Wisconsin,\nIllinois, and Minnesota. Follow-up investigations indicate that potentially\ninfected rats may have been distributed or received in Alabama, Arkansas,\nColorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,\nNorth Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. All\ninvestigations to date have indicated that the affected breeding facilities\nare limited to the pet rat trade. None of these ratteries supply (or have\nsupplied) rats to research facilities.\n\nIn addition, follow-up investigations by the United States CDC and public\nhealth officials in Canada indicate that rats have been exchanged between the\nUnited States and Canada. According to the Canada IHR national focal point\nreport of 10 February 2017, the Canadian rat breeding facilities under\ninvestigation exported rats to the United States and also imported rats from\naffected United States facilities. As of 10 February 2017, three positive\nhuman cases for the Hemorrhagic Fever Renal Syndrome (HFRS) group of\nhantaviruses, which includes Seoul, Hantaan, Puumala and Dobrava viruses, have\nbeen identified by serology in Canada. No serious illness was reported in\nthese individuals. Two of the cases breed rats, and the third had contact with\nrats. Further laboratory testing and virus characterization is ongoing.\nFurther epidemiologic investigation and testing of rats is planned.\n\n### Public health response\n\nHealth authorities both in the United States and Canada are implementing the\nfollowing measures to respond to the outbreak:\n\nCanada\n\n  * Further laboratory testing and virus characterization to confirm Seoul virus exposure in humans.\n  * Assessment of associated pet rat breeding facilities.\n  * Further epidemiological investigation and testing of rats.\n\nUnited States of America\n\n  * The United States CDC and State Health Departments are collaborating to investigate the outbreak.\n  * Depopulation carried out in some affected ratteries.\n  * Investigations regarding the importation and exportation of the rats before the detection of the outbreak ongoing.\n\n### Information on Seoul virus\n\nSeoul virus is a type of hantavirus that is transmitted from rats to humans\nafter exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents,\nor after exposure to dust from their nests or bedding. Transmission may also\noccur from rat bites or when contaminated materials are directly introduced\ninto broken skin or onto mucous membranes. For Seoul virus, the natural host\nis the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the black rat (Rattus rattus). This\nvirus has been found in both pet rats and wild rat populations around the\nworld. The incubation period varies from 1 to 8 weeks; however, most\nindividuals develop symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure. Seoul virus\ninfection symptoms can range from mild to severe. In the severe form of the\ndisease, patients can exhibit bleeding and renal syndromes. Inapparent\ninfections can also occur. Seoul virus infection is not transmissible from\nhuman to human. There is no effective treatment available for Seoul virus\ninfection.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nHemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is the severe form of the\ninfection with Seoul virus. The case fatality rate (CFR) among humans who\ndevelop HFRS due to Seoul virus ranges from 1-2%. Of the 11 cases reported in\nthe United States so far, two were hospitalized and none have died.\n\nAlthough the three HFRS cases in Canada are still under investigation, there\nis some evidence of an epidemiological link to the United States Seoul virus\noutbreak.\n\nThere is no available information on further distribution of the infected rats\noutside of the United States and Canada. Rats do not show symptoms of disease\nwhen they are infected with Seoul virus. Once infected, rats can continue to\nshed virus throughout their lives, potentially infecting other rats and\nhumans. The United States CDC is working with state health departments in the\nUnited States and others to investigate the outbreak of Seoul virus infections\nin pet rats and humans, to trace shipments and transport of rats, some of\nwhich may be infected with Seoul virus, to better understand how the virus\nentered the pet trade and to interrupt transmission of Seoul virus to other\nrats and humans.\n\nBecause there is presently no effective treatment for Seoul virus infection,\npreventing infections in people is important.\n\nIf infected rodents have contact with local rat populations, the infection\nwith Seoul virus could spread to non-infected rodents and consequently change\nthe prevalence of this zoonotic disease, both in rodents and in humans.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nInternational pet trade has the potential to spread and cause emerging or re-\nemerging disease in humans.
