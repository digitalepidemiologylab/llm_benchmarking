The response activities are geared towards strengthening the response capacity with adequate human resources, as well as supporting efforts to reduce the entomological indices for the Aedes aegypti mosquito across the island and enhancing clinical management capacity.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nJamaica has been reporting dengue cases since 1990 and throughout 2018;\nhowever, an increase has been observed since December 2018 exceeding the\nepidemic threshold. Similar large increases were reported in 2010 (2887\ncases), 2012 (4670 cases), and 2016 (2297 cases). The increase of dengue in\nthe Caribbean islands may result in more severe secondary dengue virus\ninfections and require comprehensive risk communication.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nOn 21 November 2018, PAHO/WHO alerted Member States about an increase in\ndengue cases in countries and territories in the Americas and recommended\ncoordinated actions both inside and outside of the health sector, including\nprioritizing activities to prevent transmission of dengue as well as deaths\ndue to this disease.\n\nPAHO/WHO further advises to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak\npreparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector\nmanagement as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological\nUpdate on Dengue, available at the link below.\n\n  * PAHO Epidemiological Alert: Dengue (21 November 2018)\n\nThere is no specific treatment for disease due to dengue; therefore,\nprevention is the most important step to reduce the risk of dengue infection.\nWHO recommends proper and timely case management of dengue cases. Surveillance\nshould continue to be strengthened within all affected areas and at the\nnational level. Key public health communication messages should continue to be\nprovided to reduce the risk of transmission of dengue in the population.\n\nIn addition, integrated vector management (IVM) activities should be enhanced\nto remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize\nindividual exposures. This should include both larval and adult vector control\nstrategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, and chemical\ncontrol measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and\nhouseholds. Where indoor biting occurs, household insecticide aerosol\nproducts, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce\nbiting activity. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air\nconditioning can also reduce biting. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary\nvector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, personal protective\nmeasures such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight\nhours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to\nclothing. The use of repellents must be in strict accordance with label\ninstructions. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection for\nthose who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, the bedridden, and night-shift\nworkers) as well as during the night to prevent mosquito bites.\n\nWHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied\nbased on the information available for this event.\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\nRead more about Dengue and severe dengue\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",9903,"('\n\nOn 3 January 2019, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal\nPoint of Jamaica notified WHO of an increase in dengue cases in Jamaica.\n\nFrom 1 January though 21 January 2019, 339 suspected and confirmed cases\nincluding six deaths were reported (Figure 1).

The response activities are geared towards strengthening the response capacity with adequate human resources, as well as supporting efforts to reduce the entomological indices for the Aedes aegypti mosquito across the island and enhancing clinical management capacity. ### WHO risk assessment Jamaica has been reporting dengue cases since 1990 and throughout 2018; however, an increase has been observed since December 2018 exceeding the epidemic threshold. Similar large increases were reported in 2010 (2887 cases), 2012 (4670 cases), and 2016 (2297 cases). The increase of dengue in the Caribbean islands may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and require comprehensive risk communication. ### WHO advice On 21 November 2018, PAHO/WHO alerted Member States about an increase in dengue cases in countries and territories in the Americas and recommended coordinated actions both inside and outside of the health sector, including prioritizing activities to prevent transmission of dengue as well as deaths due to this disease. PAHO/WHO further advises to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue, available at the link below. There is no specific treatment for disease due to dengue; therefore, prevention is the most important step to reduce the risk of dengue infection. WHO recommends proper and timely case management of dengue cases. Surveillance should continue to be strengthened within all affected areas and at the national level. Key public health communication messages should continue to be provided to reduce the risk of transmission of dengue in the population. In addition, integrated vector management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposures. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. Where indoor biting occurs, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce biting activity. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce biting. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, personal protective measures such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight hours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing. The use of repellents must be in strict accordance with label instructions. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection for those who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, the bedridden, and night-shift workers) as well as during the night to prevent mosquito bites. WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied based on the information available for this event. ',)",5660,4-february-2019-dengue-jamaica-en,1,1299

To date, 169 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection\nand 112 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 69 deaths. In\naddition, 41 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and\n55 cases (33 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-five (25)\nhealth care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths\n(12 confirmed).\n\nClinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (53 cases, including 23\ndeaths), Guekedou (122/87), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4)\nand Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported\nfrom Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (60/38), Macenta\n(13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). These updated figures include 3\nnew cases isolated on 20 April from Conakry and Guekedou, 2 of whom are\nlaboratory confirmed. Five new deaths have also been reported among existing\ncases; all 5 of the deaths were patients with confirmed EVD. Twenty-one (21)\npatients were in isolation in Conakry (12), Guekedou (8) and Macenta (1),\nwhile 16 patients who recovered from their illness were discharged from\nhospital.\n\nContact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. A total of 217\ncontacts are currently under medical observation and 92 have completed their\n21 days of follow-up.\n\nThe numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to\nconsolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and\ncontact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations. As\nthe incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the\nGuinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and\nadditional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.\n\n### Liberia\n\nFrom 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in\nLiberia, to 21 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has\nreported a total of 34 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases,\nincluding 6 deaths, 2 probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The date of onset\nof the most recent confirmed case was 6 April and the date of admission of the\nlast confirmed case was 10 April. The confirmed and probable cases were\nreported from Lofa and Margibi Counties, while suspected cases have been\nreported from Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado and Nimba Counties as a\nresult of enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases in HCWs has been adjusted down from 3 cases to\ntwo as data are reviewed against case definitions and laboratory results. The\ntotal number of deaths has also been revised from 13 to 11 as one of the\ndeaths has been counted in the EVD statistics for Guinea and one death\noccurred in a discarded case. As laboratory tests have been conducted on 32\nclinical samples overall only 6 of which have tested positive for ebolavirus\nto date, it is anticipated that most of the suspected cases currently reported\nby Liberia will be reclassified as discarded and removed from the case count\nin the future.\n\nFollowing data review, the number of contacts now stands at 162 in total; Foya\ndistrict, Lofa County, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia accounts\nfor 72% (116) of the total contacts followed by Margibi County (17%, 28\ncontacts). Fifty-nine contacts (36% of the total) have completed 21 days\nfollow up and have been discharged from medical observation.\n\n### Sierra Leone\n\nAs of 22 April 2014, clinical samples from 19 clinically compatible cases of\nEVD have been tested at the Kenema Government Hospital. All 19 samples tested\nnegative for ebolavirus. As part of enhanced surveillance activities, the\nMinistry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone also decided to test for the\npresence of ebolavirus in samples from patients referred to the Lassa Fever\nIsolation Ward of the Kenema Hospital for the investigation of viral\nhemorrhagic fever-like illness who tested negative for Lassa fever virus\ninfection.

The virus\nhas been detected in sewage only; no case of paralytic polio has been\nreported. Genetic sequencing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing to\ndetermine its origin. Preliminary analyses indicate the strain is not related\nto the virus currently affecting the Horn of Africa. The virus isolate was\ndetected through routine environmental surveillance in Israel that involves\nregular testing of sewage water. Israel has been free of indigenous WPV\ntransmission since 1988. In the past, wild poliovirus has been detected in\nenvironmental samples collected in this region between 1991 and 2002 without\noccurrence of cases of paralytic polio in the area.\n\nFollowing detection of the wild poliovirus, health authorities in Israel are\nconducting a full epidemiological and public health investigation, actively\nsearching for potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un-\nimmunized persons.

In Europe (Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), most H3N2 viruses that have been characterized antigenically so far this season were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; in the UK, 2/3 of isolates characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and one third were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In Canada, more than a half of the A(H3N2) isolates characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, while the rest were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the US, more than ¾ of the A(H3N2) isolates were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the last eight weeks, five deaths in children, two in England and three in Scotland, have been confirmed as due to A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus. A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains are drift variants of the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine virus. Therefore antibodies produced against the A/Panama/2007/99-like strain(see WER 2003 78(9): 58-62 and WER 2003 87(11):77 ) do cross-react with A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, but at a lower level. For example, in laboratory tests of sera from recipients of influenza vaccines currently used in the northern hemisphere, there were on average 41% reductions in the post-immunization antibody titres to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, when compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain. However despite such reductions, the tests demonstrated that 76% of adult and 72% of the elderly vaccinees possessed protective levels of antibody(HI titres of >40) to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains.

In 2008-2009, Côte d'Ivoire was affected\nby a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting west Africa (and which\nwas recently stopped).\n\nThere is currently a high risk of further spread of WPV3 - both within and\nfrom - Côte d'Ivoire.

Planning is\nunderway to ensure capacity (ie technical, vaccine, operational) is in place\nfor this emergency response. Coordination with other United Nations (UN)\norganizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Côte\nd'Ivoire is ongoing, to ensure that OPV is added to any planned immunization\nactivity, in particular for displaced populations.

The Ebola epidemic trend\nremains precarious, with community and health-facility transmissions of\ninfection still taking place. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7\ndeaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases\nand 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect,\nprobable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD\ncases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected\nchains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is\nretrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up\noutbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable\ncase of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old\nLiberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in\nhospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in\nLagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while\ntraveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died\non 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis\nwas conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital\nand tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being\nreferred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar,\nSenegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working\nclosely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained\nat the source.\n\n### Health sector response\n\nIn an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West\nAfrica, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community\nand development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies\nagain pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are\nunderway to secure additional human and financial resources.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his\nfact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia\nearlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and\nGuinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD\noutbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best\nways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with\nPresidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials,\ninternational and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held.\n\nDuring the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the\noutbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection\nprevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each\nnational health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected\ncountries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and\ncommunities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re-\ndeploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to\nthe field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural\npractices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border\ncollaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to\ncoordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the\nRegional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries\nand reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community\nin support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak.\n\nOn 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director\nofficially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre\n(SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical\nsupport at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked\nits partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to\nsit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre.\nThe establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency\nMinisterial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month.\n\nEfforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the\nresponse in the three countries, including contact tracking, public\ninformation and community mobilization, case management and infection\nprevention and control, and coordination.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea,\nLiberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this\nevent.\n\n### Disease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the\nMinistries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia,\nand Sierra Leone. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 108 new cases of EVD, including\n12 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 12 new\ncases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 25 new cases with 2 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 71\nnew cases and 5 death. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable,\nand suspect cases and deaths of EVD.\n\nAs of 23 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the\nthree countries stands at 1 201, including 672 deaths. The distribution and\nclassification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 427 cases (311 confirmed,\n99 probable, and 17 suspected) and 319 deaths (208 confirmed, 99 probable, and\n12 suspected); Liberia, 249 cases (84 confirmed, 84 probable, and 81\nsuspected) and 129 deaths (60 confirmed, 50 probable, and 19 suspected); and\nSierra Leone, 525 cases (419 confirmed, 56 probable, and 50 suspected) and 224\ndeaths (188 confirmed, 33 probable, and 3 suspected).\n\n### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease\nin Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 23 July 2014\n\n  \nNew (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country  \nGuinea  \nCases 12 311 99 17 427  \nDeaths 5 208 99 12 319  \nLiberia  \nCases 25 84 84 81 249  \nDeaths 2 60 50 19 129  \nSierra Leone  \nCases 71 419 56 50 525  \nDeaths 5 188 33 3 224  \nTotals  \nCases 108 814 239 148 1 201  \nDeaths 12 456 182 34 672  \n1\\.

Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7\ndeaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases\nand 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect,\nprobable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD\ncases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected\nchains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is\nretrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up\noutbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable\ncase of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old\nLiberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in\nhospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in\nLagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while\ntraveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died\non 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis\nwas conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital\nand tested positive for Ebola virus.

Countries and agencies\nagain pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are\nunderway to secure additional human and financial resources.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his\nfact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia\nearlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and\nGuinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD\noutbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best\nways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with\nPresidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials,\ninternational and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held.\n\nDuring the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the\noutbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection\nprevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each\nnational health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected\ncountries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and\ncommunities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re-\ndeploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to\nthe field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural\npractices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border\ncollaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to\ncoordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the\nRegional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries\nand reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community\nin support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak.\n\nOn 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director\nofficially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre\n(SEOCC) in Conakry.

Two isolates with\napparent genetic linkages were isolated from environmental samples, collected\non 20 October and 28 November 2016. Virus was isolated from environmental\nsamples only and no associated cases of paralysis linked to the isolated\nstrains have been detected in Quetta or anywhere else in the province.\n\nPakistan also continues to be affected by endemic transmission of wild\npoliovirus type 1 (WPV1). As of 21 December, 19 WPV1 cases have been reported\nin 2016. It is the lowest number of annual cases ever reported, from the\nfewest number of affected areas in the country.\n\nThe majority of the polio cases during the last six months were reported from\nnon-reservoir areas, i.e. from ‘tier 2, 3 and 4’ districts (districts which\nare considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection). There have been\nno paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in\nPakistan since February 2016.\n\n### Public health response\n\nA response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in the Quetta and\nneighbouring districts is now planned, in line with internationally-agreed\nprotocols. The first campaign of a series of campaigns is planned for 2\nJanuary 2017. In addition, the Ministry of National Health Services,\nRegulations and Coordination (MoHSRC), supported by World Health Organization\n(WHO), UNICEF and other partners, is further strengthening active search for\ncases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and conducting an in-depth field\ninvestigation to more clearly ascertain the circulation of this strain.\nPakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio\neradication, to urgently interrupt all remaining strains of polio transmission\nin the country.\n\nThe area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational\ncommon reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting\nWPV1 transmission in this area remains the top most priority of the federal,\nprovincial and district health teams. Meticulous preparations are underway\nthrough the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and\nDistrict Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of upcoming back-\nto-back national and sub-national vaccination rounds, in December 2016,\nJanuary 2017 and February 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). These\ncampaigns are critical to addressing the remaining pockets of under-immunized\npopulations sustaining low-intensity WPV1 transmission within the common\nreservoir.\n\nTo ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate\nresources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified\nreasons for missed children; validating vaccination teams’ microplans,\nvaccinator selection, training and supervision; and enhancing local engagement\nwith communities through community leaders. In order to jointly address\ntransmission across the common reservoir, close coordination is ongoing with\nAfghanistan teams at all levels.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nWHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common\nreservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical\nspread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with\nAfghanistan). WHO also assesses the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the common\nreservoir as medium to high. Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to\nother countries is assessed low.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nIt is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel\nand contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance\nfor acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new\nvirus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories\nand areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at\nthe district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.\n\nWHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-\naffected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

The area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational common reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting WPV1 transmission in this area remains the top most priority of the federal, provincial and district health teams. Meticulous preparations are underway through the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and District Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of upcoming back- to-back national and sub-national vaccination rounds, in December 2016, January 2017 and February 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). These campaigns are critical to addressing the remaining pockets of under-immunized populations sustaining low-intensity WPV1 transmission within the common reservoir. To ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate resources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified reasons for missed children; validating vaccination teams’ microplans, vaccinator selection, training and supervision; and enhancing local engagement with communities through community leaders. In order to jointly address transmission across the common reservoir, close coordination is ongoing with Afghanistan teams at all levels. ### WHO risk assessment WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common reservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical spread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with Afghanistan). WHO also assesses the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the common reservoir as medium to high. Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to other countries is assessed low. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission is subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure. ',)",4997,27-december-2016-polio-pakistan-en,19,1226

The current epidemic trend of EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia remains serious, with 67 new cases and 19 deaths reported from 15 – 17 July 2014. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The EVD outbreak in Guinea continues to show a declining trend, with no new cases reported during this period. Critical analyses and review of the current outbreak response is being undertaken to inform the process of developing prioritized national operational plans. Effective implementation of the prioritized plans will be vital in reversing the current trend of EVD outbreak, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone. ### Health sector response WHO has been working with national authorities and partners in the affected countries to analyse and review the current outbreak response. An assessment of the outbreak response conducted in Liberia identified several gaps and challenges. Some of the gaps identified include low coverage of contact tracing; persisting denial and resistance in the community; weak data management; inadequate infection prevention and control practices, especially in peripheral health facilities; and weak leadership and coordination at sub- national levels. Underpinning these challenges were limited financial resources and human technical capacity. Comprehensive mapping of the financial, logistics, and human resource needs will be articulated in the national operational plan under development. This exercise of developing prioritized operational plans is also being conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Following the call for regional collaboration during the Accra Ministerial meeting, the Government and the Ministry of Health of Gambia provided a team of 11 health-care workers to support outbreak response in Sierra Leone. While this team will contribute the critical human resource needs, the mission will be crucial for enhancing capacity for epidemic preparedness and response in The Gambia. This mission is being supported by UNDP, Gambia, and WHO Sierra Leone. Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 15 – 17 July 2014, 67 new cases of EVD, including 19 new deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 0 new cases and 0 deaths; Liberia, 22 new cases with 10 deaths; and Sierra Leone 45 new cases and 9 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 17 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 048, including 632 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 410 cases (301 confirmed, 95 probable, and 14 suspected) and 310 deaths (203 confirmed, 95 probable, and 12 suspected); Liberia, 196 cases (76 confirmed, 56 probable, and 64 suspected) and 116 deaths (54 confirmed, 40 probable, and 22 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 442 cases (368 confirmed, 48 probable, and 26 suspected) and 206 deaths (165 confirmed, 35 probable, and 6 suspected). ### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 17 July 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country Guinea Cases 0 301 95 14 410 Deaths 0 203 95 12 310 Liberia Cases 22 76 56 64 196 Deaths 10 54 40 22 116 Sierra Leone Cases 45 368 48 26 442 Deaths 9 165 35 6 206 Totals Cases 67 745 199 104 1048 Deaths 19 422 170 40 632 1\\.

The Ebola epidemic trend\nremains precarious, with community and health-facility transmissions of\ninfection still taking place. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7\ndeaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases\nand 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect,\nprobable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD\ncases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected\nchains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is\nretrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up\noutbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable\ncase of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old\nLiberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in\nhospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in\nLagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while\ntraveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died\non 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis\nwas conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital\nand tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being\nreferred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar,\nSenegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working\nclosely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained\nat the source.\n\n### Health sector response\n\nIn an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West\nAfrica, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community\nand development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies\nagain pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are\nunderway to secure additional human and financial resources.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his\nfact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia\nearlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and\nGuinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD\noutbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best\nways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with\nPresidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials,\ninternational and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held.\n\nDuring the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the\noutbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection\nprevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each\nnational health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected\ncountries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and\ncommunities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re-\ndeploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to\nthe field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural\npractices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border\ncollaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to\ncoordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the\nRegional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries\nand reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community\nin support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak.\n\nOn 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director\nofficially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre\n(SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical\nsupport at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked\nits partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to\nsit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre.\nThe establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency\nMinisterial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month.\n\nEfforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the\nresponse in the three countries, including contact tracking, public\ninformation and community mobilization, case management and infection\nprevention and control, and coordination.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea,\nLiberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this\nevent.\n\n### Disease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the\nMinistries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia,\nand Sierra Leone. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 108 new cases of EVD, including\n12 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 12 new\ncases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 25 new cases with 2 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 71\nnew cases and 5 death. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable,\nand suspect cases and deaths of EVD.\n\nAs of 23 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the\nthree countries stands at 1 201, including 672 deaths.

Two more cases died bringing\ntotal deaths to 62 (CFR: 72%). The cases are spread across three districts in\nsouth-east Guinea (Guekedou, Macenta, and Kissidougou districts). Seven of the\ncases are currently undergoing treatment in isolation units in Guekedou\ndistrict. Investigations on reported cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone along\nthe border with Guinea are ongoing.\n\nEleven of the reported cases have been confirmed by Institut Pasteur Lyon,\nFrance, Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar, Senegal and Bernhard-Nocht Institute of\nTropical Medicine Hamburg, Germany using PCR test.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) together with WHO and other partners continues to\nimplement measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread.\n\nThe MOH and MSF have established isolation facilities in Guékédou district,\nand plans are underway to establish an additional isolation ward in Macenta\ndistrict.

Three associated human\ncases have also been reported, all with a benign febrile illness.\n\nTowards the end of January, six pregnant buffalo were observed to abort, and,\nshortly after, 3 giraffes and 1 waterbuck were found dead without obvious\nsigns of predator attack. Three veterinarians in contact with tissues from\nthese animals developed an uncomplicated, febrile illness. Deaths among goat\nkids in adjacent areas have also been recorded. Virus has been detected in\ntissues from the buffalo fetuses, the waterbuck, a giraffe, and 1\nveterinarian.\n\nA program of control measures has been instituted: local farmers have been\nadvised to vaccinate their livestock, and public health information on\nappropriate precautions has been disseminated to those involved in the\nlivestock industry. Mosquito control measures have been increased in tourist\ndestinations.

He was admitted to hospital in\nHong Kong SAR on 11 February with pneumonia but died on 17 February. Influenza\nA (H5N1) was isolated from post-mortum specimens on 20 February. The man´s 9\nyear old son also became unwell whilst in Fujian province. He was admitted to\nhospital in Hong Kong SAR on 12 February with pneumonia. Influenza A (H5N1)\nwas isolated from two nasopharageal aspirates taken from the boy on 19\nFebruary. The boy is in a stable condition. Additional family members have\nalso had respiratory symptoms.

This is the only case of WPV3 detected in Asia in 2011.\nWPV3 transmission in Asia is on the verge of elimination, with the last case\noccurring more than six months ago, on 18 November 2010 (also from Khyber\nAgency, FATA).\n\nConfirmation of continuation of WPV3 transmission in tribal areas of Pakistan\nhas significant implications for the global effort to eradicate WPV3,\nparticularly as Asia is on the verge of eliminating circulation of this\nstrain. The detection of WPV3 in Pakistan represents the risk that it may\nspread from this transmission focus to other WPV3-free areas of Asia and\nbeyond. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at historically low levels in 2011,\nwith other circulation of this strain restricted to parts of west Africa (17\ncases in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali and Niger), Nigeria (five cases) and Chad\n(three cases).

The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in\nthe mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks.\n\nHFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a\nmild self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by\nenteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been associated with\nserious complications in certain groups, and may cause deaths.\n\nHFMD mainly occurs amongst children under 10 years old. The usual period from\ninfection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days.\n\nThe disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently\nwith a sore throat. One or two days after fever onset, painful sores develop\nin the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become\nulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks.\nA non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots,\nsome with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and\nsoles of the feet, and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A\nperson with HFMD may not have symptoms, or may have only the rash or only\nmouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief\nfebrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and\nsuccumb rapidly from the disease.\n\nHFMD virus is contagious and infection is spread from person to person by\ndirect contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or\nthe stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the\nfirst week of the illness but the period of communicability can last for\nseveral weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should\nnot be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth\ndisease.\n\nPresently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD.

Samples were collected and shipped to the Kenya Medical\nResearch Institute (KEMRI) Arboviral Laboratory in Nairobi. On 16 May, KEMRI\nlaboratory confirmed 7 of the 10 samples tested positive for Chikungunya\nvirus. All samples tested negative for other arboviruses including: dengue,\nyellow fever and West Nile viruses.\n\nMoreover, from partial sequencing of the envelope gene it was observed that\nthe CHIK isolates from Mandera are grouped with isolates from the post-2005\nIndian Ocean islands, Asia and Europe. Full genome sequencing is underway.\n\nTo date, KEMRI has received a total of 177 samples of suspected cases in the\nlaboratory for testing. Of thse, 53 of these came from Somalia and rest from\nMandera. 57 were positive by IgM antibody testing and 38 were positive for\nCHIK virus by RT-PCR. Of the positives, 9 were both IgM and PCR positive.\n\nAs of 30 June 2016, 1,792 cases had been line listed. No deaths have been\nreported so far. However there is a risk of underreporting of cases since many\npatients are not reporting to health facilities. There have been outbreaks of\nChikungunya in neighbouring Bula Hawa region in Somalia border region\noriginating from Mogadishu. It is estimated that about 80% of the population\nand 50% of the health work force in Mandera town were affected by Chikungunya.\nCases with severe debilitating joint pains were being managed as inpatients\nfor a short duration for 1 or 2 days. However, the majority of the cases are\nnot seeking treatment in health facilities.\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO country office supported the Ministry of Health to dispatch seven\ntechnical staff to support the County government of Mandera in risk\nassessment. WHO supported a rapid vector assessment survey, it was observed\nthat most of the breeding habitats for the Aedes vectors for chikungunya in\nMandera are within domiciliary containers mainly for water storage. The\ndensity of day-biting Aedes vectors were substantially high and County vector\ncontrol activities were minimal.\n\nA cross border and coordination meeting between Somalia and Kenya took place\non 30 May 2016 to coordinate joint response activities to control the\noutbreak. The meeting recommended a lead agency to coordinate response\nactivities across the border and to improve coordinated surveillance and\ninformation sharing. Other partners who were part of the response included MSF\nand Kenya Red cross. MSF supplied 30,000 treated mosquito nets, which targeted\nabout 30% coverage for the population at risk. The MOH also provided 5000 ITNs\nfor hospital use and chemicals for vector control.\n\nThe last outbreak of Chikungunya in Kenya was in 2004 and 2005, where at least\n1,300 cases were documented. The affected areas were Lamu and Mombasa in the\nCoast region. A seroprevalence survey done in October 2004 suggested that 75%\nof the population in Lamu had been affected.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nIn the past, the outbreak that began in 2004, on the Kenyan coast reached the\nComoros at the end of 2004 before spreading to the Indian Ocean islands in\n2005. A mutation in the E1 gene and selection chikungunya virus strains that\nincrease adaptation of the virus to one of the vector Aedes albopictus and\ntherefore significantly increase transmissibility has likely occurred in\nReunion Island at the end of 2005 and resulted in an unprecedented outbreak\nand a further spread to the rest of the world.\n\nIf confirmed the preliminary sequencing results the circulation of the mutated\nchikungunya stain could yield significantly higher attack rate than with the\nformerly circulating African strain. Ae albopictus is an invasive species that\ncontinues to expand geographically in various parts of the world, could\ntherefore represent a further risk of geographical extension the current\noutbreak in the affected countries and beyond .\n\nThe risk for a moderate to high scale outbreak of Chikungunya in the area\ncannot be ruled out due to the presence of the disease vector, immunologically\nnaive population and potential upcoming rains in the area. Besides potential\ncross border span of the outbreak, under-reporting of cases and low levels of\nhealth seeking behaviours among the affected population is concerning.\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",8492,"('\n\nOn 28 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Kenya notified WHO of an outbreak of\nChikungunya in Mandera East sub-county.\n\nThe first reports of an increase in cases with febrile illness and joint pains\noccurred in May 2016.

Information about the nature of\nEbola virus disease (EVD) was highlighted. This was followed by outlining the\nessential components for control, including the need for national leadership,\nimproved care and case management, identifying transmission chains and\nstopping disease spread, and preventing further outbreaks. Among the critical\nissues are: cross-border infections and travelers; partners reaching the\nlimits of their capacity and ability to respond rapidly, safely, and\neffectively; and concerns about the socio-economic impact of continued\ntransmission.\n\nThe Director-General also shared information from her recent meetings in\nGuinea with Member States of the Mano River Union – Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea,\nLiberia, and Sierra Leone. She outlined that the response in West Africa would\nfocus on three areas:\n\n  * Treatment of Guéckédou, Kenema, and Foya as a unified sector, which will include public health measures meant to reduce movement in and out of the area. \n  * Intensifying current measures in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.\n  * Taking steps to reduce international spread to other countries in Africa and outside of the African Region.\n\nThe Sub-regional Ebola Operations Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry\nreported on 5 August that the following actions are underway in the four\naffected countries:\n\n  * In Guinea, new foci have emerged and case management facilities will be needed. Exit screening is currently being tested in Conakry, in partnership with the US CDC. \n  * In Liberia, security issues continue to be of concern, notwithstanding the commitment of the Government. Community resistance remains high.\n  * In Nigeria, the Government is focused on following up the contacts from the index case. Clinical support is urgently needed and a treatment centre is being set up for managing cases of EVD.\n  * In Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to map where treatment centres are most needed and getting those set up. A similar exercise is underway for laboratories. \n\nThe SEOCC is assisting countries with these and many other response measures.\n\nOn 6 August, WHO is convening an Emergency Committee of international experts\nto review the outbreak and advise the Director-General, in accordance with the\nInternational Health Regulations, whether the Ebola virus disease outbreak\nconstitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\nExperts will receive an epidemiological briefing and will determine whether\nthe criteria for a PHEIC have been met. If the Emergency Committee agrees that\nthis is a PHEIC, they will then advise the Director-General on temporary\nrecommendations. A summary of the meeting will be made public and a press\nbriefing will be held on Friday, 8 August.\n\n### Disease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the\nMinistries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

The samples showed serologic evidence of recent\nZika virus infection by IgM enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and\nconfirmatory plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) at the U.S.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Serum collected from the infant’s\nmother during the week after the infant’s birth showed serologic evidence of\nrecent infection with a flavivirus by IgM ELISA and confirmatory PRNT.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThis case report adds to the growing literature on Zika virus and\nmicrocephaly. Although evidence concerning a potential association between\nZika virus and congenital neurological disorders among newborns is mounting,\nthe available information is not yet sufficient to establish such a causative\nlink. Further investigations are, therefore, required. Until more is\nunderstood, Members States are advised to standardize and enhance surveillance\nfor microcephaly and other neurological disorders, particularly in areas of\nknown Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such transmission.

The patient is a television producer who has been under treatment, in isolation, at a hospital in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, since 20 December. This is the first confirmed case of SARS in 2004, and the first case not linked to a laboratory accident that has occurred since the initial outbreak of SARS was declared contained on 5 July 2003. Laboratory-related cases occurred after that date in Singapore in September and in Taiwan, China in December of last year. The Guangdong case has been under investigation, with WHO support, since 26 December, when the suspected case was initially reported by Chinese authorities. Previous diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results. In view of the limitations of SARS diagnostic tests, confirmation of positive results by a WHO-designated reference laboratory is required for a definitive diagnosis of SARS. The confirmatory tests were conducted in Hong Kong by both the University of Hong Kong at the Queen Mary Hospital and the Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health. Both laboratories are members of the WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Diagnosis that collectively identified the SARS coronavirus in mid-April 2003, and have considerable diagnostic expertise. The source of infection for this newly confirmed case remains unclear. Several lines of investigation last year suggest that SARS may have originated from contact with wild animals sold for human consumption at live markets in southern China. Studies conducted last year detected a SARS-like virus in some animal species, including the masked palm civet. Retrospective analysis of patient records has linked several of the earliest cases, which began occurring in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, to contact with wild animals. However, no animal reservoir of the SARS coronavirus has been conclusively identified to date. Epidemiological investigations in China have not yet been able to link the patient to exposure to wild animals or any other known or suspected source of the virus. Chinese authorities have introduced several measures as investigation of the case has evolved. The patient has been treated in isolation since his hospitalization on 20 December, four days after the onset of symptoms. All contacts have been traced and followed up. All are reported to be free of symptoms and most have been released from quarantine, suggesting that no further transmission has occurred. Surveillance for additional cases has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces. The single isolated case does not constitute grounds for issuing a SARS alert or recommending any restrictions on travel or trade. At the request of Chinese authorities, additional WHO teams are being sent this week to assist in research aimed at identifying the source of infection and preventing further cases. The first cases of SARS occurred in Guangdong in mid-November 2002. The disease began to spread internationally in late February 2003, eventually causing more than 8000 cases, with 774 deaths, in 27 countries. ',)",3242,2004_01_05-en,74,631

Nigeria: Seventeen States, all the major states in the northern part of the country, have reported the cumulative total of 22 545 cases. Eight States reported 93% of these cases: Bauchi (4 399 cases, 802 deaths), Jigawa (1 286 cases, 164 deaths), Kano (2 765 cases, 421 deaths), Kaduna (2 000 cases, 500 deaths), Katsina (1 683 cases, 351 deaths), Kebbi (6 099 cases, 620 deaths), Sokoto (1 728 cases, 370 deaths) and Yobe (1 020 cases, 379 deaths). Further epidemiological data from Kano State indicate that two-thirds of the cases were in children under 16 years of age. "",)",1926,1996_03_15b-en,76,32

Cholera has since been confirmed in all three holding centres in\nKigoma town. As at 4 December, 1 100 cases of presumed cholera had been\ndetected (note: the case definition of presumed cholera is only ""watery\ndiarrhoea"") in the refugee population; six were fatal - three among children\nunder 10 years of age and three in patients over 60 years of age. Six percent\nof the 1 100 presumed cases required IV rehydration. The population in the\nholding centres is estimated at 25 000. The number fluctuates as refugees\ncontinue to arrive from Zaire and others are transferred from the holding\ncentres to the camps. Based on a total refugee population at risk the 1 100\ncases detected correspond to a daily incidence of watery diarrhoea of 5-8 per\n1 000. Incidence of bloody diarrhoea is 2 to 3 per thousand per day.\n\nAction taken: Improving water, sanitation and living conditions in all three\nKigoma holding centres was the first priority. Latrines have been built, water\nis now available almost continuously and trucks are transporting people out of\nthe holding centres to the camps at a rate of 1 000 persons per day, weather\npermitting. Daily surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in all camps and holding\ncentres by IRC, MSF and UNHCR is coupled with active case-finding in the\nholding centres by community health workers. MSF has set up an emergency\ntreatment area in one of the holding centres for oral and IV rehydration and\nstrict hygienic control of the cholera patients. Nyarugusu Camp, which is\nreceiving most of the refugees transferred out of the holding centres, is also\nready to treat patients with cholera. Ujiji Hospital, which has a special\ndiarrhoea ward, is being upgraded by MSF logistics. Wards are being rebuilt,\nelectricity is brought in, extra latrines are under construction. Forty extra\nbeds, in addition to the existing 10, will be made available this week. Vibrio\ncholerae cultures obtained from both refugees and locals have been sent to the\nTanzanian Reference Laboratory for confirmation, grouping and sensitivity\ntesting.

Daily surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in all camps and holding centres by IRC, MSF and UNHCR is coupled with active case-finding in the holding centres by community health workers. MSF has set up an emergency treatment area in one of the holding centres for oral and IV rehydration and strict hygienic control of the cholera patients. Nyarugusu Camp, which is receiving most of the refugees transferred out of the holding centres, is also ready to treat patients with cholera. Ujiji Hospital, which has a special diarrhoea ward, is being upgraded by MSF logistics. Wards are being rebuilt, electricity is brought in, extra latrines are under construction. Forty extra beds, in addition to the existing 10, will be made available this week. Vibrio cholerae cultures obtained from both refugees and locals have been sent to the Tanzanian Reference Laboratory for confirmation, grouping and sensitivity testing. Supplies have also been ordered to allow the local laboratory technician to work on identification and sensitivity testing of cholera strains, as well as shigella strains, should a shigella outbreak occurs.

The first cholera outbreak reported in 2017 was in Tana River County.\nThe outbreak started on 10 October 2016 and was controlled by April 2017.\n\nA second wave of cholera outbreaks started in Garissa County on 2 April 2017\nand was reported later in nine other counties including Nairobi, Murang’a,\nVihiga, Mombasa, Turkana, Kericho, Nakuru, Kiambu, and Narok. The outbreak is\nbeing reported in the general population and in refugee camps. In Garissa\nCounty, the outbreak is affecting mainly Dadaab refugee camps and cases and\ndeaths are being reported from Hagadera, Dagahaleh, and IFO2 camps. In Turkana\ncounty, the disease is also affecting Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps.\n\nIn addition to the outbreak reported in the general population, there have\nbeen two point source cholera outbreaks in Nairobi County. One occurred among\nparticipants attending a conference in a Nairobi hotel on 22 June 2017. A\ntotal of 146 patients associated with this outbreak have been treated in\ndifferent hospitals in Nairobi. A second outbreak occurred at the China Trade\nFair held at the KICC Tsavo Ball between 10 and 12 July 2017. A total of 136\ncases were reported and one death.\n\nCurrently, the outbreak is active in two counties, namely Garissa and Nairobi.\nAs of 17 July 2017, a total of 1216 suspected cases including 14 deaths (case\nfatality rate: 1.2%) have been reported since 1 January 2017. In the week\nending 16 July 2017, a total of 38 cases with no deaths were reported.\n\nA total of 124 cases tested positive for Vibrio cholerae in the reference\nlaboratory. In the week ending 25 June 2017, 18 samples out of 25 tested\npositive for Vibrio cholerae Ogawa by culture at the National Public Health\nLaboratory in Nairobi.\n\nThe main causative factors of the current outbreak include the high population\ndensity that is conducive to the propagation and spread of the disease, mass\ngatherings (a wedding party held in Karen and in a hotel during an\ninternational conference), low access to safe water and proper sanitation and\nthe massive population movements in country and with neighbouring countries.\n\nSince December 2014, the Republic of Kenya has been experiencing continuous\nlarge outbreaks of cholera, with a cumulative total of 17 597 cases reported\n(10 568 cases reported in 2015 and 6448 in 2016).\n\n### Public health response\n\nThe country has activated the national task force to coordinate the response\nto the outbreak. Since January 2017, WHO and partners are providing technical\nsupport to the country for the control of the outbreak. The country will\ndevelop a response plan with focus on the preparedness interventions to avert\nfurther spread of the outbreak. The WHO country office will repurpose their\nstaff members and experts deployed in Nairobi for the management of the post\nEl Niño effects in the Horn of Africa to support the quick control of this\noutbreak. WHO will also support the five most at risk counties with disease\nsurveillance and response coordination. Partners on the ground are committed\nto provide support to the ongoing response efforts including support to\nprimary health care and social mobilization by United Nations Children’s Fund\n(UNICEF).\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nCholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of bacterium\nVibrio cholerae present in faecally contaminated water or food. It is\nprimarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation.\nCholera is always considered a potentially serious infectious disease and can\ncause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly,\ndepending on the exposure frequency, population exposed and the context.\n\nCholera outbreaks have been reported in the Republic of Kenya every year with\nlarge cyclical epidemics every five to seven years.\n\nThe risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at national and regional\nlevels and moderate at global level. The outbreak occurred in the context of a\nsub-regional drought, conflicts and insecurity in the Horn of Africa. In\naddition, the outbreak is affecting the densely populated capital city\nNairobi, and two large refugee camps (Kakuma and Dadaab) with massive\npopulation movements within country and between neighbouring countries.\nPrevious large outbreaks in the Republic of Kenya have originated from similar\nsettings, and the risk for propagation of cholera within the affected area as\nwell as to other parts of the country is high.

The first one, was from an acute flaccid\nparalysis (AFP) case with onset of paralysis on 21 October 2018, a six-year\nold girl with no history of vaccination, and the second isolate was from a\ncommunity contact of the first case, a child aged one-year old.\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO and partners at the regional and country level are assisting the Ministry\nof Health and local public health authorities to conduct a thorough field\ninvestigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological), to assess the\nextent and original source of circulation of this virus more clearly, and to\nfurther plan and support the implementation of an outbreak response as\nappropriate, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.\n\nWhile national routine oral polio vaccine type 3 (OPV3) immunization coverage\nin 2017 was estimated at 80%, population immunity gaps remain at subnational\nlevels, especially in Zambézia province (with 60% OPV3 coverage).\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nWHO assessed the overall public health risk at the national level to be high\ndue to a decline in population immunity to type 2 poliovirus and the risk of\ninternational spread to be medium due to ongoing population movements.\n\nThe detection of cVDPV2 underscores the importance of maintaining high routine\nvaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any\npoliovirus circulation and underscores the risk posed by any medium to low-\nlevel transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to\nrapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the\naffected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue\nto evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being\nimplemented.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nIt is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel\nand contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance\nfor AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to\nfacilitate a rapid response.

The three provinces\nwhich have reported cholera cases in this outbreak have been severely affected\nby the flooding which has resulted in the displacement of people and damage to\nthe infrastructure, including health facilities. The meteorological forecast\nindicates that this heavy rainfall will continue for the next three months\nwhich may contribute to the potential spread of the outbreak.\n\nIt is not possible to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, as no\nepidemiological or environmental investigations have been conducted in the two\naffected provinces and disease risk factors are unknown. Priorities at this\nstage are to strengthen the surveillance system, and harmonizing cholera data\ncollection and line listing of the cases, as well as putting in place a\nmechanism for active case finding at the community level. In addition, the\ncholera case definition should be strictly applied to all suspected cases to\ndecrease underreporting and to improve case detection in this outbreak. Other\nresponse activities such as case management, implementation of WASH\ninterventions and social mobilization also need to be strengthened at the\nnational, provincial, district and community levels.\n\nThe overall risk is assessed as high at the national level; this assessment is\npartially due to the lack of information regarding the current outbreak\ndynamics and response actions. The risk is assessed to be low at the regional\nand global levels.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nWHO recommends improving access to safe water, sanitation capacities, and\nhygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of\nsurveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to case\nmanagement should be improved in the affected areas. National capacity to\nrapidly detect and respond is needed if the outbreak spreads to other areas.\nThe provision of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread of the outbreak\nshould also be considered.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Mozambique\nbased on the information available.

Three provinces and six districts were affected in the 2017 outbreak (Tete, Nampula, and Maputo province). ### Public health response WHO and partners are supporting response activities to contain the outbreak. The following response measures are ongoing: * The Ministry of Health is leading a weekly coordination meeting at the national level to discuss the ongoing response. Partners including WHO, UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and the Red Cross attend and support the meeting. * Multi-sectoral coordination particularly at the district level; coordinating response actions between the different sectors and it is led by district officials. * WHO has conducted a rapid assessment of the situation in Nampula province and has shared the findings at the national coordination meeting. * WHO has supported training on case management and surveillance in Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces to improve case management, case detection, and reporting. * With support from UNICEF, national and local health authorities have provided logistical support to set up and supply cholera treatment centers with consumable, medication, and infection prevention and control supplies. Cholera treatment centers have been set up in each of the affected districts. * There are efforts to improve water quality, sanitation conditions, and hygiene practices in the affected districts are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities and water supply sector with the support of partners. * Social mobilization and risk communication activities are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities with the support of partners. ### WHO risk assessment Risk factors contributing to the propagation of cholera to other provinces and districts in this outbreak include a shortage of potable water and contamination of household drinking water, which emphasize the need to improve access to clean water, adequate hygiene, and sanitation. The three provinces which have reported cholera cases in this outbreak have been severely affected by the flooding which has resulted in the displacement of people and damage to the infrastructure, including health facilities. The meteorological forecast indicates that this heavy rainfall will continue for the next three months which may contribute to the potential spread of the outbreak. It is not possible to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, as no epidemiological or environmental investigations have been conducted in the two affected provinces and disease risk factors are unknown. Priorities at this stage are to strengthen the surveillance system, and harmonizing cholera data collection and line listing of the cases, as well as putting in place a mechanism for active case finding at the community level. In addition, the cholera case definition should be strictly applied to all suspected cases to decrease underreporting and to improve case detection in this outbreak. Other response activities such as case management, implementation of WASH interventions and social mobilization also need to be strengthened at the national, provincial, district and community levels. The overall risk is assessed as high at the national level; this assessment is partially due to the lack of information regarding the current outbreak dynamics and response actions. The risk is assessed to be low at the regional and global levels. ### WHO advice WHO recommends improving access to safe water, sanitation capacities, and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to case management should be improved in the affected areas. National capacity to rapidly detect and respond is needed if the outbreak spreads to other areas. The provision of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread of the outbreak should also be considered. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Mozambique based on the information available. The use of safe drinking water and the implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.

The highest number of cases was reported from France with 14\n025 cases for the first six months of the year. In addition, eleven of all\ncases in the Region were lethal (6 in France and one in each of Germany,\nKyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United\nKingdom). The predominant genotype currently circulating in the European\nRegion is D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The\nmost recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September, with 12 cases.\nMember States have responded to the outbreak by modifying the vaccination\nschedule, like France, or by offering vaccination free of charge or in\nschools, to increase accessibility to and availability of vaccines.\n\nAfrica: The Regional Office reports that as of September 2011 large measles\noutbreaks are being reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with\nover 103 000 cases, Nigeria, with 17 428 cases, and Zambia, with 5 397 cases,\nand Ethiopia, with 2 902 cases. Even though deaths are not routinely reported\nto the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo reports over 1100 measles-associated deaths in the country during\n2011.\n\nAmericas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the region in\n2002. In 2011 the Region has received reports of several outbreaks linked to\nimportation of measles virus from other regions. The largest, in Quebec,\nCanada, involves 742 reported cases, 89 requiring hospitalization, but no\nmeasles-associated deaths. Other outbreaks have been reported from the United\nStates (213 cases), Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Columbia (7 cases),\nMexico (3 cases), and Chile (6 cases).

Countries need to ensure that they reach 95% coverage with two\ndoses of measles vaccine across all age groups up to 15 years of age.\nOtherwise the country will experience measles outbreaks with large numbers of\ncases, associated hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in\ncountries with high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles\nexportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region of the\nAmericas or certain African countries.

However,\nthere was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163\ncases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions.\nAn unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR\nin 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has\nbeen eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries\nsuch as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently\nnine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong\nSAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and\nSingapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles\nElimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more\nthan 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island\nCountries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made\npositive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination\ncoverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and\nmovement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable\nto outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine\n(MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.\n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly\navailable or information shared by Member States with WPR\n\n### Regional update\n\n#### Australia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported\nnationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of\ncases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of\ncases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or\noutbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\n\n#### China\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the\npredominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number\nof cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the\npopulation size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons.\nIn January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles\ncases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here\nand here\n\n#### Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual\nreported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few\nyears. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is\n66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases,\n27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew\nmembers of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link\nidentified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8),\nMainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan\n(6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam\n(1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second\nvaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the\nexisting policy. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Macao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China.\nOf these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but\nepidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases\ninclude 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Japan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had\nachieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378\nmeasles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases\nrecorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were\namong persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13),\nMyanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New\nZealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1),\nThailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri\nLanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a\ntotal of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of\ncases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with\nno or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Malaysia\n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia\nincreased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an\nincrease of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to\nmeasles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among\nunimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases\n(76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for\nconfirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000\npopulation. For more information, please see here and here\n\n#### New Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three\nclusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39\ncases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three\nin Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in\nCanterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines.\nA typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018\nassociated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related\nto travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person\nwho made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have\noccurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018,\na total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles\nelimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for\nfirst and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016.\nFor more information, please see here\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In\nFebruary 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles\noutbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro\nManila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five\nregions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1\nJanuary to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381\ndeaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared\nto the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded\nthe highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%)\nfollowed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The\nmajority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and\nunder five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low\nimmunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below\n70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6\nmillion Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from\nmeasles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine\nimmunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root\ncause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Republic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported,\nincluding eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with\nrecent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16),\nPhilippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1),\nMadagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more\ninformation, please see here\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO is working with Member States and partners to:\n\n  * Detect measles cases early and prevent avoidable deaths through case management \n  * Investigate, guide response to, and mobilize funds for ongoing measles outbreaks\n  * Develop risk communication plans and mobilize communities\n  * Strengthen outbreak preparedness \n  * Strengthen overall immunization systems and improve routine vaccination coverage\n  * Plan and implement preventive supplemental immunization campaigns to increase population immunity \n  * Strengthen laboratory-supported measles surveillance\n  * Develop national action plans for measles elimination\n  * Monitor progress towards and verify achievement of measles elimination through the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination\n  * Produce Regional guidance for preparedness for and response to measles and rubella outbreaks.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of\nmorbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the\navailability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an\nincreasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks\nin countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the\nresurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization\ncoverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can\nspread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and\nlocal levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants\ntoo young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants\nand those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be\nprotected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates\n(> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care\nservices, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A\ndeficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease\nafter infection.\n\nGiven the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and\nresponse, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing\npossibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular\nmovement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or\nfrom measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles;\ncountries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and\nlocal level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.\n\nThe recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to\ngaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among\nsubpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and;\n4) vaccine hesitancy.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nMeasles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to\nonset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset\nan average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international\ntravel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case\npatients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the\nrash to 4 days after the rash erupts.\n\nWith ongoing measles outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the\nWPR urges Member States to refer to and implement the following published WHO\nguidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness\nand response to measles outbreaks, including detailed procedures for effective\nsurveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, which enable\nrapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:\n\nWPRO Measles Elimination Field Guide (2013)1 [pp. 25—33, 38—52]; and Regional\nStrategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western\nPacific (2018)2 [pp. 72—76]. In particular, all countries in the WPR -\nregardless of country context or whether they have achieved elimination of\nendemic measles transmission or are currently experiencing an ongoing outbreak\n- should urgently take the following actions:\n\n  * Intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever to ensure measles cases are rapidly detected, confirmed and linked to rapid public health action.\n    * Intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all acute rash and fever cases to the vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance system, regardless of clinical suspicion and to be particularly attentive to whether patients have travelled internationally or have been in contact with international travellers in the preceding 21 days.\n    * Ensure that protocols and procedures for reporting, sample collection, rapid laboratory testing for case confirmation and genotyping, and epidemiological linkage for case confirmation are updated and reinforced among stakeholders.\n    * Analyse and provide regular and timely feedback of surveillance data to healthcare facilities and subnational public health officials (e.g. updates on suspected case counts nationally and at the subnational level).\n  * Ensure contingency resources for human resources, available vaccine stock, and operational funds are inventoried, and accessible to support rapid outbreak investigation and response immunization if measles cases are detected\n  * Identify coordination and leadership structures, mechanisms for rapid response team activation and lines of communication between local level, sub national and national level. \n  * Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing “zero-dose” to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread.\n  * Update and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO’s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. \n\nWHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel\nrestrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide\nhow best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and\ncommunities from disease.

However,\nthere was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163\ncases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions.\nAn unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR\nin 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has\nbeen eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries\nsuch as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently\nnine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong\nSAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and\nSingapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles\nElimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more\nthan 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island\nCountries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made\npositive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination\ncoverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and\nmovement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable\nto outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine\n(MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.\n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly\navailable or information shared by Member States with WPR\n\n### Regional update\n\n#### Australia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported\nnationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of\ncases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of\ncases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or\noutbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\n\n#### China\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the\npredominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number\nof cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the\npopulation size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons.\nIn January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles\ncases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here\nand here\n\n#### Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual\nreported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few\nyears. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is\n66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases,\n27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew\nmembers of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link\nidentified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8),\nMainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan\n(6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam\n(1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second\nvaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the\nexisting policy. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Macao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China.\nOf these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but\nepidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases\ninclude 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Japan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had\nachieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378\nmeasles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases\nrecorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were\namong persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13),\nMyanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New\nZealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1),\nThailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri\nLanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a\ntotal of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of\ncases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with\nno or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Malaysia\n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia\nincreased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an\nincrease of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to\nmeasles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among\nunimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases\n(76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for\nconfirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000\npopulation. For more information, please see here and here\n\n#### New Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three\nclusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39\ncases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three\nin Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in\nCanterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines.\nA typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018\nassociated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related\nto travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person\nwho made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have\noccurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018,\na total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles\nelimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for\nfirst and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016.\nFor more information, please see here\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In\nFebruary 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles\noutbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro\nManila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five\nregions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1\nJanuary to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381\ndeaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared\nto the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded\nthe highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%)\nfollowed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The\nmajority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and\nunder five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low\nimmunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below\n70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6\nmillion Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from\nmeasles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine\nimmunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root\ncause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Republic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported,\nincluding eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with\nrecent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16),\nPhilippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1),\nMadagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more\ninformation, please see here\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO is working with Member States and partners to:\n\n  * Detect measles cases early and prevent avoidable deaths through case management \n  * Investigate, guide response to, and mobilize funds for ongoing measles outbreaks\n  * Develop risk communication plans and mobilize communities\n  * Strengthen outbreak preparedness \n  * Strengthen overall immunization systems and improve routine vaccination coverage\n  * Plan and implement preventive supplemental immunization campaigns to increase population immunity \n  * Strengthen laboratory-supported measles surveillance\n  * Develop national action plans for measles elimination\n  * Monitor progress towards and verify achievement of measles elimination through the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination\n  * Produce Regional guidance for preparedness for and response to measles and rubella outbreaks.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of\nmorbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the\navailability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an\nincreasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks\nin countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the\nresurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization\ncoverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can\nspread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and\nlocal levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants\ntoo young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants\nand those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be\nprotected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates\n(> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care\nservices, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A\ndeficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease\nafter infection.\n\nGiven the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and\nresponse, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing\npossibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular\nmovement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or\nfrom measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles;\ncountries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and\nlocal level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.\n\nThe recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to\ngaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among\nsubpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and;\n4) vaccine hesitancy.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nMeasles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to\nonset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset\nan average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international\ntravel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case\npatients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the\nrash to 4 days after the rash erupts.\n\nWith ongoing measles outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the\nWPR urges Member States to refer to and implement the following published WHO\nguidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness\nand response to measles outbreaks, including detailed procedures for effective\nsurveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, which enable\nrapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:\n\nWPRO Measles Elimination Field Guide (2013)1 [pp. 25—33, 38—52]; and Regional\nStrategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western\nPacific (2018)2 [pp. 72—76]. In particular, all countries in the WPR -\nregardless of country context or whether they have achieved elimination of\nendemic measles transmission or are currently experiencing an ongoing outbreak\n- should urgently take the following actions:\n\n  * Intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever to ensure measles cases are rapidly detected, confirmed and linked to rapid public health action.\n    * Intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all acute rash and fever cases to the vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance system, regardless of clinical suspicion and to be particularly attentive to whether patients have travelled internationally or have been in contact with international travellers in the preceding 21 days.\n    * Ensure that protocols and procedures for reporting, sample collection, rapid laboratory testing for case confirmation and genotyping, and epidemiological linkage for case confirmation are updated and reinforced among stakeholders.\n    * Analyse and provide regular and timely feedback of surveillance data to healthcare facilities and subnational public health officials (e.g. updates on suspected case counts nationally and at the subnational level).\n  * Ensure contingency resources for human resources, available vaccine stock, and operational funds are inventoried, and accessible to support rapid outbreak investigation and response immunization if measles cases are detected\n  * Identify coordination and leadership structures, mechanisms for rapid response team activation and lines of communication between local level, sub national and national level. \n  * Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing “zero-dose” to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread.\n  * Update and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO’s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. \n\nWHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel\nrestrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide\nhow best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and\ncommunities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports,\nincluding on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful\nadjunct to raising measles awareness in the community.

This resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO regions, with an unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas in WPR in 2019. Nine countries and areas in WPR have achieved measles elimination, but several countries and areas have reported outbreaks due to low immunization coverage and vaccine hesitancy. The WHO Regional Office for WPR is urging Member States to intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever, intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all cases, and ensure contingency resources are available for outbreak investigation and response immunization.

To correct this misunderstanding, WHO\ncalled a press conference at the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva on 14 August.\nDr Isabelle Nuttall, speaking on behalf of WHO, said, “Air travel, even from\nEbola-affected countries, is low-risk for Ebola transmission.”\n\nDr Nuttall further clarified modes of transmission for Ebola and emphasized\nthat the disease is not an airborne virus, unlike influenza or tuberculosis.\nThe infection is transmitted to others through direct contact with the bodily\nfluids of a sick person, such as blood, vomit, sweat, and diarrhoea. Even if\nan individual infected with EVD travels by plane, the likelihood of other\npassengers and crew coming into contact with the individual’s bodily fluids is\nvery low.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in\ncases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected\nwith EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do\nnot include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.)\nTemporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions\nto be taken by countries can be found at:\n\n  * IHR Emergency Committee meeting on Ebola outbreak in west Africa\n\nOn 13 August, Heads of Global Information Systems (GIS) for WHO, UN agencies,\nintergovernmental agencies, and partners met to continue mapping the EVD\ncrisis and create an interagency common operations picture.

The virus was isolated from\nchildren with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the\nsouth of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of\nparalysis ranging from 18 July through 16 September 2018. This outbreak has\nalso affected Jigawa, Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, and Borno states in Nigeria, with\n17 cases reported since April 2018.\n\nNigeria has also reported a separate cVDPV2 outbreak in Sokoto State that\ndates back to January 2018. Nigeria is one of only three countries in the\nworld classified as endemic for wild poliovirus, along with Afghanistan and\nPakistan.\n\nAs part of the polio outbreak response in the Lake Chad Basin countries\n(Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria) the last\nmonovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) round was implemented in Niger in\nJanuary 2017.\n\n### Public health response\n\nThe outbreak response plan is being finalized to include the outbreak zone\nmost at risk and the exact scale and extent of the response is being\ndetermined.\n\n  * Two mOPV2 response vaccination campaigns will reach 3.2 million children under five years of age in four provinces in Niger (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi and Zinder). The first round took place from 24 through 27 October 2018 and the second is scheduled for 7 through 11 November 2018.\n  * Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.\n  * WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. \n  * Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded. \n  * WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.\n  * WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health are working together to finalize the deployment of the human resources needed at national and provincial levels. \n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThe emergence of cVDPV2 in Niger is a reminder that until polio is eradicated,\npolio-free countries will remain at risk of polio re-infection or re-\nemergence. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of\nmaintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to\nminimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.\n\nAs this outbreak is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria, the risk\nof further international spread associated with this virus remains high.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nIt is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel\nand contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance\nfor AFP in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement prevention\nmeasures, and speed-up the response if needed. Countries should also maintain\nhigh polio immunization coverage through routine vaccination to minimize the\nconsequences of any new virus introduction or emergence.\n\nWHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-\naffected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for\nmore than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of\noral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks\nto 12 months of travel. For travellers to Niger, IPV is recommended as it is\neffective against cVDPV2, whereas the type 2 component is no longer included\nin OPV.\n\nAll countries should report any polio case using the decision instrument in\nAnnex 2 of the International Health Regulations (IHR).

Of the 21 initially reported cases on 8 May\n2018, 17 had epidemiological links (potential contacts with another suspect\ncase).\n\nFive samples were collected from hospitalized patients, three from Ikoko-\nImpenge and two from Bikoro.

So far, 31 259 cases and 517 deaths have been reported in eight\ncountries (see map below). Seasonal factors, such as the rainy season, along\nwith population movements in the area contribute to this unusually high\nincidence of cholera.\n\nWHO, with international and national health partners, is providing technical\nsupport to the ministries of health at the country and sub-regional level. WHO\nis working to strengthen surveillance activities. Supplies for case management\nand chlorination of water have also been dispatched to some of the countries.\n\nBreakdown by country:\n\nBurkina Faso: 295 cases including 8 deaths (case fatality rate -CFR 2.7%) have\nbeen reported in Ouagadougou town as of 22 August, affecting sectors of the\ntown with precarious water and sanitation conditions.\n\nGuinea: 571 cases including 32 deaths (CFR 5.6%) have been reported between\nmid-July and 4 August. Control efforts are ongoing.\n\nGuinea-Bissau: 9047 cases including 172 deaths (CFR 1.9%) occurred between 6\nJune and 21 August in the country. The regions of Bissau and Bimbo account for\n83% of cases; cholera is now spreading to remote areas with 10 regions out of\n11 affected.\n\nLiberia: 703 cases including 29 deaths (CFR 4.1%) have been reported for the\nperiod from 1 to 21 August, including Sinoe County.\n\nMali: 158 cases including 20 deaths (CFR 12.65%) have occurred between 20 June\nand 24 July. The situation appears to be under control, although cholera is an\nongoing problem in Mali.\n\nMauritania: 497 cases including 10 deaths (CFR 2%) have been reported in\nNouakchott from 20 July to 10 August. The country reported a total of 717\ncases from early May to 12 August occurring in 4 regions ( Brakna, Guidimakha,\nNouakchott, and Traza).\n\nNiger: 125 cases including 15 deaths (CFR 12%) have been reported in Bouza,\nTahoua region with 3 districts affected between 13 July and 24 August.

It is, therefore, of paramount importance to investigate the factors that contributed to this higher than expected mortality rate. Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood of flare-ups, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems. ### WHO advice WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available.

Travel/contact history of cases is not yet known.\n\nFollowing a joint mission of Institut Pasteur, Paris and Association pour la\nMédecine Préventive (AMP) ) to investigate the epidemic meningitis situation,\n10 additional cases of N. meningitidis W135 were laboratory confirmed.\xa0 The\nsamples were taken from documented cases between 10-24 April 2001 and the\nproportion of N. meningitidis isolates belonging to the W135 serogroup was\nfound to be 37% of the total N. meningitidis isolates identified by PCR on\ncollected specimens.\xa0 None of the cases had any relationship with the 2001 Haj\npilgrimage (travel or contact history). \xa0 Among 4 strains that were cultured\nfrom the same period, 3 were W135:2a:P1-2,5 and belong to the ET-37 complex.\n\nNiger: A joint mission of Institut Pasteur, Paris and AMP investigated the\nepidemic meningitis situation and identified 10 laboratory confirmed cases of\nN. meningitidis W135. The samples were taken from documented cases between\n10-16 April 2001 and the proportion of N. meningitidis isolates belonging to\nthe W135 serogroup was found to be 40% of the total N. meningitidis isolates\nidentified by PCR on collected specimens. \xa0 None of the cases had any\nrelationship with the 2001 Haj pilgrimage (travel or contact history).\n\nCentral African Republic: 3 cases (Haj pilgrims) have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 have been laboratory confirmed.\n\nDenmark: 2 cases (one case close contact with Haj pilgrims, the travel/contact\nhistory of the second case is not yet known)have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nFrance: 2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nNorway: 4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nSaudi Arabia: 109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia)\nincluding 35 deaths have been reported between 9 February and 22 March 2001.\nN. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more than half\nof the cases.\n\nSingapore: 4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims, 1 history of travel to\nSaudi Arabia), including 1 death have been reported. Two of the cases occurred\nin January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 41 cases (8 pilgrims\nreturning from the Haj, 19 cases of close contacts and data outstanding on the\nremaining cases) including 11 deaths of laboratory confirmed invasive N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 have been reported.\n\nMeningococcal disease. As with all types of meningococcal disease, early\ndiagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group W135\nmeningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease: sudden\nonset of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting, photophobia and\nstiff neck.

Between 28 October 2018 –\n20 January of 2019, a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS, including\n11 deaths have been reported in Epuyén, Chubut Province. Epuyén has a\npopulation of approximately 2 000 persons, and Chubut Province is located in\nPatagonia in southern Argentina.\n\nThe index case had environmental exposure prior to symptom onset on 2\nNovember, and subsequently attended a party on 3 November. Six cases who also\nattended the party experienced the onset of symptoms between 20-27 November\n2018. An additional 17 cases, all of whom were epidemiologically-linked to\npreviously confirmed cases, experienced symptom onset between 7 December 2018\nand 3 January 2019 (Figure 1). Potential human-to-human transmission is\ncurrently under investigation.\n\nOf the confirmed cases, 59% were female, and had an incubation period ranging\nfrom 8 to 31 days. Approximately 50% of these confirmed cases reported\nsymptoms within the past three weeks. Cases were confirmed by ELISA IgM\nu-captura or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nAs of 17 January 2019, a total of 98 asymptomatic contacts have been\nidentified and are being monitored for the potential development of symptoms.\n\nIn Argentina, four endemic regions have been identified: North (Salta, Jujuy),\nCentro (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Ríos), Northeast (Misiones) and Sur\n(Neuquén, Río Negro, and Chubut). Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 100\nconfirmed cases were registered annually, with the provinces of Buenos Aires,\nSalta, and Jujuy having the highest numbers of cases. Between 2013 and 2018,\n114 confirmed deaths from hantavirus were reported in Argentina, with a case-\nfatality rate of 18.6%, though this figure was close to 40% for some provinces\nin the southern region of the country.\n\nIn Chile, one of the confirmed cases was a healthcare worker who resides in\nPalena Province, Los Lagos Region, and reported experiencing symptoms on 2\nJanuary 2019. The case had a travel history to Epuyén for one day in mid-\nNovember, and later hosted and cared for a confirmed case from Epuyén while\nshe was in her prodromal phase. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus\nin Los Lagos Region in 2019. During 2018, there were eight cases of hantavirus\nreported in Chile, including two deaths.\n\n#### Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of HPS by week of symptom onset\nin Epuyén, Chubut Province, Argentina.\n\nSource: Published by the Ministry of Health of Chubut Province and reproduced\nby PAHO/WHO\n\n### Public health response\n\nHealth authorities in Argentina and Chile are implementing the following\npublic health measures:\n\n  * Enhanced surveillance and active case finding including increase local diagnostic capacities for hantavirus for early diagnosis\n  * Daily follow-up of contacts \n  * Deployments of multi-disciplinary teams to the affected areas for outbreak investigation \n  * Environmental control measures\n  * Conduct risk communication activities; including educational awareness and health promotion in the communities and in healthcare facilities\n  * Implementation of infection prevention and control measures \n  * Safe case management of HPS patient in dedicated health care facilities \n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nHPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to\nthe genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily\nthrough inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta,\ndroppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection\nusually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic\nrodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to\nthe virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever,\nmyalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\nand abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and\nhypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after\ninitial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one\nweek and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can\nreach 35-50%.\n\nIn the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries.\nEnvironmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a\nseasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is\nsylvatic rodents, mainly Sigmodontinae species, transmission can occur when\npeople come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human\ntransmission of HPS due to Andes virus in Argentina has been previously\ndocumented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient\nisolation. Standard precautions1 should always be put in place, as well as\nrodent control measures.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nPAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection,\ninvestigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control\nof infections caused by hantavirus.\n\nParticular attention should be paid towards travelers returning from the\naffected areas. Early identification and timely medical care greatly improves\nclinical outcomes.

Between 28 October 2018 –\n20 January of 2019, a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS, including\n11 deaths have been reported in Epuyén, Chubut Province. Epuyén has a\npopulation of approximately 2 000 persons, and Chubut Province is located in\nPatagonia in southern Argentina.\n\nThe index case had environmental exposure prior to symptom onset on 2\nNovember, and subsequently attended a party on 3 November. Six cases who also\nattended the party experienced the onset of symptoms between 20-27 November\n2018. An additional 17 cases, all of whom were epidemiologically-linked to\npreviously confirmed cases, experienced symptom onset between 7 December 2018\nand 3 January 2019 (Figure 1). Potential human-to-human transmission is\ncurrently under investigation.\n\nOf the confirmed cases, 59% were female, and had an incubation period ranging\nfrom 8 to 31 days. Approximately 50% of these confirmed cases reported\nsymptoms within the past three weeks. Cases were confirmed by ELISA IgM\nu-captura or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nAs of 17 January 2019, a total of 98 asymptomatic contacts have been\nidentified and are being monitored for the potential development of symptoms.\n\nIn Argentina, four endemic regions have been identified: North (Salta, Jujuy),\nCentro (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Ríos), Northeast (Misiones) and Sur\n(Neuquén, Río Negro, and Chubut). Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 100\nconfirmed cases were registered annually, with the provinces of Buenos Aires,\nSalta, and Jujuy having the highest numbers of cases. Between 2013 and 2018,\n114 confirmed deaths from hantavirus were reported in Argentina, with a case-\nfatality rate of 18.6%, though this figure was close to 40% for some provinces\nin the southern region of the country.\n\nIn Chile, one of the confirmed cases was a healthcare worker who resides in\nPalena Province, Los Lagos Region, and reported experiencing symptoms on 2\nJanuary 2019.

The causative agent belongs to\nthe genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily\nthrough inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta,\ndroppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection\nusually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic\nrodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to\nthe virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever,\nmyalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\nand abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and\nhypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after\ninitial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one\nweek and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can\nreach 35-50%.\n\nIn the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries.\nEnvironmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a\nseasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is\nsylvatic rodents, mainly Sigmodontinae species, transmission can occur when\npeople come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human\ntransmission of HPS due to Andes virus in Argentina has been previously\ndocumented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient\nisolation. Standard precautions1 should always be put in place, as well as\nrodent control measures.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nPAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection,\ninvestigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control\nof infections caused by hantavirus.\n\nParticular attention should be paid towards travelers returning from the\naffected areas. Early identification and timely medical care greatly improves\nclinical outcomes.

New cases and deaths attributed\nto EVD continue to be reported from the three countries. Between 13 – 14 July\n2014, 18 new cases and 11 deaths were reported from Sierra Leone, Liberia and\nGuinea. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The\noccurrence of community deaths, still being reported in Guinea, remains a\nserious concern. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and\nits partners to step up outbreak containment measures.\n\n### Health sector response\n\nThe national authorities in the three affected countries are scaling up\noutbreak containment measures. In Sierra Leone, the Ministry of Health has\nestablished an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) aimed at ensuring effective\ncoordination and accelerating implementation of the EVD outbreak response. The\nEOC is chaired by the Minister of Health and co-chaired by the WHO\nRepresentative for Sierra Leone, with members including heads of the different\nsub-committees of the task force, other senior staff, and key partners. The\nEOC will oversee the development of the prioritized operational plan in line\nwith the Accra inter-country strategy, ensure that priority interventions are\nimplemented as planned, and streamline communication and information flow.\n\nIn Guinea, a high level political delegation comprised of the President of the\nNational Assembly, the Ministers of Health and Communication, and senior\ngovernment officials conducted a 3-day field visit to Guéckédou, from 14 – 17\nJuly 2014. Outbreak response teams in Guéckédou, where community deaths\ncontinue to be reported, encountered resistance and apprehension from the\ncommunities. The delegation engaged local and opinion leaders in order to\nbuild a relationship of trust with the community, which should foster\ncooperation and enhance acceptance of outbreak control measures. As a result\nof this engagement and dialogue, leaders of 19 out of 23 villages pledged\ntheir commitment to embrace the EVD outbreak response. Meanwhile, leaders of\nthe four villages that did not turn up for the meeting later made contacts\nwith the local administrative authority, expressing their willingness to be\npart of the response. In addition, the national authority has established\nadministrative and law enforcement mechanisms to deal with extreme instances\nof resistance, such as violence towards the response teams.\n\nIn Liberia, the Chief Medical Officer including senior officials of the\nMinistry of Health, WHO, and other partners visited Foya district, the\nepicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. The field visit aimed to streamline\nand strengthen implementation of outbreak containment measures.

To date, 191 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection\nand 115 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 72 deaths. In\naddition, 42 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and\n61 cases (35 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-six (26) health\ncare workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12\nconfirmed).\n\nClinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (58 cases, including 24\ndeaths), Guekedou (127/91), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4)\nand Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported\nfrom Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (63/41), Macenta\n(13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). The date of onset of the most\nrecent clinical case, a suspected case, is 23 April while the date of\nisolation of the most recent confirmed case is 22 April. Two new deaths have\nalso been reported among existing cases; one of the deaths was a patient with\nconfirmed EVD. Thirteen (13) patients are in isolation in Conakry (6 patients,\n5 confirmed), Guekedou (7 patients, all confirmed). Contact tracing activities\ncontinue in all affected areas.\n\nOverall, the epidemiological situation in Guinea has improved significantly\nover the last few weeks. The date of onset of the last reported case from\nMacenta was 24 days ago and a similar time has elapsed for Dabola (25 days),\nKissigougou (26) and Djingaraye (31 days). Two incubation periods (42 days)\nwithout cases is the standard for declaring an EVD outbreak over in a\nparticular location.\n\nThe focus of response activities at present includes clinical case management\nand ongoing training in hospital-based infection prevention and control (IPC).\nA documentary will be made on the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) isolation\nfacility in Guekedou. WHO, in collaboration with the Global Outbreak Alert and\nResponse Network (GOARN), has mobilized a new medical team comprising of IPC\nand intensive care physicians in support of the clinicians at the Donka\nHospital in Conakry.\n\nThe numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to\nconsolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance\nactivities and contact tracing activities. The Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, has arrived in Guinea to further\nstrengthen diagnostic capacity for EVD by retesting patients who were\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative by ebolavirus serology.\n\nThe cross-border meeting on EVD response between the governments of Guinea and\nLiberia was successfully hosted by the Guinean government, attended by 25\nparticipants from delegations from both countries. The overall objective of\nthe meeting was to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and the follow up\nof contacts along the borders of the two countries in order to stop\ntransmission of EVD. Key actions for implementation include: development of an\naction plan on the cross-border response to EVD; strengthening coordination of\ncross-border activities with engagement of local authorities; sharing\ninformation on the cross-border movement of suspected cases of EVD;\nreinforcing community awareness of EVD and ways to reduce personal and\ncommunity risk of disease; and reinforcing active surveillance and contact\ntracing along the border as needed.\n\nAs the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that\nthe Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and\nadditional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.\n\n### Liberia\n\nFrom 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in\nLiberia, to 24 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of\nLiberia has reported a total of 35 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6\nconfirmed cases, 2 probable cases and 27 suspected cases. The date of onset of\nthe most recent confirmed case was 6 April. The MOHSW has started to\nreclassify suspected cases against their laboratory test results. Most of the\nsuspected cases are expected to be discarded at the end of this process.\n\nWHO, in collaboration with GOARN, is planning to replace experts who recently\ncompleted their missions in Liberia in the areas of case management, IPC and\nepidemiology.\n\n### Sierra Leone\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone is currently\ninvestigating 3 patients with an illness compatible with a viral haemorrhagic\nfever (VHF) for EVD and Lassa fever (the latter is endemic in Sierra Leone).\nAll rumours of EVD cases are being investigated and active case finding is\nalso ongoing.\n\nThe laboratory at the Lassa Fever isolation facility at the Kenema Government\nHospital is now analysing all suspected cases of VHF for both Lassa fever and\nEVD. As of 24 April 2014, 98 samples collected have been tested; 10 samples\ntested positive for Lassa fever and the remaining 88 tested negative for both\ndiseases. Fifteen contacts have completed 21 days of follow up while 20\ncontacts remain under medical observation.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to\nGuinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for\nthis event.\n\n  * This update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",9592,"('\n\n### Guinea\n\nAs of 18:00 on 23 April, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a\ncumulative total of 218 clinical cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), including\n141 deaths.

The three markets are\nYeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the Smithfield\nRoad Market.\n\nThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has already started action to\nclose these poultry stalls and the department has requested all poultry\nstallholders to destroy the live birds in their stalls, and these stallholders\nwill be given every assistance and advice by members of the Food and\nEnvironmental Hygiene Department. The department has also made appropriate\narrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent right away to a landfill for\nproper treatment. After all the birds have been destroyed, the poultry stalls\nin the markets will be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected.\n\nWe have taken this precautionary measure for two reasons. The first is that\nsince yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763 chickens have died. There are\nalso a number of chicken deaths in the other two markets. Tests by the\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have demonstrated that\nthese chickens have died of avian influenza. I have to emphasize that there\nare many strains of H5N1 and according to the information currently available,\nonly the H5N1 chicken strain that we had in Hong Kong in 1997 would affect\nhuman beings, and the vast majority of H5N1 strains will not affect human\nbeings.\n\nFrom samples we have recently collected from these three markets, a few are\nshown to contain the H5 virus, and genes sequencing tests have demonstrated\nthat these viruses are not - I repeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1\nchicken virus that we had in Hong Kong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it\nis essential for us to take this precautionary measure because there is a need\nto destroy these viruses thoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market\nalways with the probability, no matter how low the possibility, that they\nmight - they might - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain\nwhich may affect human beings.\n\nI have to reiterate there is no cause for public concern at this stage. This\nis a precautionary measure. The indication is that there is no evidence that\nthese viruses would affect human beings. Of course, the public is reminded to\nobserve the usual hygiene standards.\n\nThe measures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the\nresults, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough\nsurveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the\narrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this\nsurveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they\narise so that we can take the necessary measures.\n\nThank you very much.  \n  \nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",8161,"('\n\nInfluenza A(H5N1) virus was recently detected in three retail live-bird\nmarkets in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, with increased\nmortality in the bird population noted in the last few days.

No H5N1 viruses were isolated in other retail markets. No human cases of H5N1 virus have been detected. The strains isolated from the birds differ genetically from the H5N1 virus which caused human disease in 1997. There is no cause for public health concern, but as a precautionary measure, the birds at all three retail markets have been destroyed and the markets cleansed and disinfected. For further information, click on the website of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. The following is the transcript of the English portion of the opening remarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the Environment and Food, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press briefing held on May 16: Precautionary measures taken to prevent spread of chicken disease I have called this press briefing to announce that at 3.30 this afternoon the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation has issued a notice declaring the poultry stalls in three markets as infected places in accordance with the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The three markets are Yeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the Smithfield Road Market. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has already started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has requested all poultry stallholders to destroy the live birds in their stalls, and these stallholders will be given every assistance and advice by members of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The department has also made appropriate arrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent right away to a landfill for proper treatment. After all the birds have been destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. We have taken this precautionary measure for two reasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763 chickens have died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other two markets. Tests by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have demonstrated that these chickens have died of avian influenza. I have to emphasize that there are many strains of H5N1 and according to the information currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain that we had in Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of H5N1 strains will not affect human beings. From samples we have recently collected from these three markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus, and genes sequencing tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I repeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong Kong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is essential for us to take this precautionary measure because there is a need to destroy these viruses thoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the probability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they might - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain which may affect human beings. I have to reiterate there is no cause for public concern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is that there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of course, the public is reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards. The measures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the results, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough surveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the arrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this surveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they arise so that we can take the necessary measures. Thank you very much. ',)",3952,2001_05_17-en,155,475

However,\nthere was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163\ncases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions.\nAn unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR\nin 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has\nbeen eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries\nsuch as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently\nnine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong\nSAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and\nSingapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles\nElimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more\nthan 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island\nCountries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made\npositive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination\ncoverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and\nmovement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable\nto outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine\n(MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.\n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly\navailable or information shared by Member States with WPR\n\n### Regional update\n\n#### Australia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported\nnationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of\ncases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of\ncases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or\noutbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\n\n#### China\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the\npredominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number\nof cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the\npopulation size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons.\nIn January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles\ncases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here\nand here\n\n#### Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual\nreported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few\nyears. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is\n66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases,\n27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew\nmembers of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link\nidentified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8),\nMainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan\n(6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam\n(1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second\nvaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the\nexisting policy. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Macao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China.\nOf these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but\nepidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases\ninclude 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Japan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had\nachieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378\nmeasles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases\nrecorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were\namong persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13),\nMyanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New\nZealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1),\nThailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri\nLanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a\ntotal of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of\ncases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with\nno or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Malaysia\n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia\nincreased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an\nincrease of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to\nmeasles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among\nunimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases\n(76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for\nconfirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000\npopulation. For more information, please see here and here\n\n#### New Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three\nclusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39\ncases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three\nin Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in\nCanterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines.\nA typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018\nassociated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related\nto travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person\nwho made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have\noccurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018,\na total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles\nelimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for\nfirst and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016.\nFor more information, please see here\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In\nFebruary 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles\noutbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro\nManila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five\nregions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1\nJanuary to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381\ndeaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared\nto the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded\nthe highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%)\nfollowed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The\nmajority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and\nunder five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low\nimmunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below\n70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6\nmillion Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from\nmeasles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine\nimmunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root\ncause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Republic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported,\nincluding eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with\nrecent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16),\nPhilippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1),\nMadagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more\ninformation, please see here\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO is working with Member States and partners to:\n\n  * Detect measles cases early and prevent avoidable deaths through case management \n  * Investigate, guide response to, and mobilize funds for ongoing measles outbreaks\n  * Develop risk communication plans and mobilize communities\n  * Strengthen outbreak preparedness \n  * Strengthen overall immunization systems and improve routine vaccination coverage\n  * Plan and implement preventive supplemental immunization campaigns to increase population immunity \n  * Strengthen laboratory-supported measles surveillance\n  * Develop national action plans for measles elimination\n  * Monitor progress towards and verify achievement of measles elimination through the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination\n  * Produce Regional guidance for preparedness for and response to measles and rubella outbreaks.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of\nmorbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the\navailability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an\nincreasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks\nin countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the\nresurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization\ncoverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can\nspread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and\nlocal levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants\ntoo young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants\nand those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be\nprotected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates\n(> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care\nservices, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A\ndeficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease\nafter infection.\n\nGiven the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and\nresponse, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing\npossibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular\nmovement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or\nfrom measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles;\ncountries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and\nlocal level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.\n\nThe recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to\ngaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among\nsubpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and;\n4) vaccine hesitancy.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nMeasles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to\nonset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset\nan average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international\ntravel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case\npatients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the\nrash to 4 days after the rash erupts.\n\nWith ongoing measles outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the\nWPR urges Member States to refer to and implement the following published WHO\nguidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness\nand response to measles outbreaks, including detailed procedures for effective\nsurveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, which enable\nrapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:\n\nWPRO Measles Elimination Field Guide (2013)1 [pp. 25—33, 38—52]; and Regional\nStrategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western\nPacific (2018)2 [pp. 72—76]. In particular, all countries in the WPR -\nregardless of country context or whether they have achieved elimination of\nendemic measles transmission or are currently experiencing an ongoing outbreak\n- should urgently take the following actions:\n\n  * Intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever to ensure measles cases are rapidly detected, confirmed and linked to rapid public health action.\n    * Intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all acute rash and fever cases to the vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance system, regardless of clinical suspicion and to be particularly attentive to whether patients have travelled internationally or have been in contact with international travellers in the preceding 21 days.\n    * Ensure that protocols and procedures for reporting, sample collection, rapid laboratory testing for case confirmation and genotyping, and epidemiological linkage for case confirmation are updated and reinforced among stakeholders.\n    * Analyse and provide regular and timely feedback of surveillance data to healthcare facilities and subnational public health officials (e.g. updates on suspected case counts nationally and at the subnational level).\n  * Ensure contingency resources for human resources, available vaccine stock, and operational funds are inventoried, and accessible to support rapid outbreak investigation and response immunization if measles cases are detected\n  * Identify coordination and leadership structures, mechanisms for rapid response team activation and lines of communication between local level, sub national and national level. \n  * Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing “zero-dose” to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread.\n  * Update and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO’s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. \n\nWHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel\nrestrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide\nhow best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and\ncommunities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports,\nincluding on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful\nadjunct to raising measles awareness in the community. People planning\ninternational travel should ensure they have been vaccinated against measles\nbecause of the high risk of exposure to the measles virus from fellow\ntravellers and in many countries in the world where measles is currently\nspreading.\n\nThe current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to\nrenew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures\ndetailed in the “Measles Elimination Field Guide”1 and the “Regional Strategy\nand Plan of Action”2 to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the\nrisk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission.\n\n  * Measles vaccines: WHO position paper (April 2017)\n  * Measles Fact Sheet\n  * WPRO Measles-Rubella Bulletin 2019\n\n* * *\n\n1Measles Elimination Field Guide (WPR, 2013)\n\n2Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in\nthe Western Pacific (WPR, 2018)\n\n3The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (EURO, 2013)\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\nRead more about\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",20073,"('\n\nGlobally, between 2016 and 2017, the number of reported measles cases\nincreased by 31%, while in the WHO Western Pacific Region (WPR), the total\nnumber of cases reported decreased by 82% during the same period. However,\nthere was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163\ncases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions.\nAn unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR\nin 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has\nbeen eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries\nsuch as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently\nnine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong\nSAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and\nSingapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles\nElimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more\nthan 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island\nCountries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made\npositive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination\ncoverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and\nmovement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable\nto outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine\n(MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.\n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly\navailable or information shared by Member States with WPR\n\n### Regional update\n\n#### Australia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported\nnationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of\ncases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of\ncases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or\noutbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\n\n#### China\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the\npredominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number\nof cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the\npopulation size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons.\nIn January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles\ncases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here\nand here\n\n#### Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual\nreported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few\nyears. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is\n66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases,\n27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew\nmembers of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link\nidentified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8),\nMainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan\n(6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam\n(1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second\nvaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the\nexisting policy. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Macao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China.\nOf these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but\nepidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases\ninclude 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Japan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had\nachieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378\nmeasles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases\nrecorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were\namong persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13),\nMyanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New\nZealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1),\nThailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri\nLanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a\ntotal of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of\ncases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with\nno or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Malaysia\n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia\nincreased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an\nincrease of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to\nmeasles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among\nunimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases\n(76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for\nconfirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000\npopulation. For more information, please see here and here\n\n#### New Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three\nclusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39\ncases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three\nin Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in\nCanterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines.\nA typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018\nassociated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related\nto travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person\nwho made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have\noccurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018,\na total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles\nelimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for\nfirst and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016.\nFor more information, please see here\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In\nFebruary 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles\noutbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro\nManila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five\nregions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1\nJanuary to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381\ndeaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared\nto the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded\nthe highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%)\nfollowed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The\nmajority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and\nunder five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low\nimmunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below\n70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6\nmillion Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from\nmeasles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine\nimmunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root\ncause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Republic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported,\nincluding eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with\nrecent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16),\nPhilippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1),\nMadagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more\ninformation, please see here\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO is working with Member States and partners to:\n\n  * Detect measles cases early and prevent avoidable deaths through case management \n  * Investigate, guide response to, and mobilize funds for ongoing measles outbreaks\n  * Develop risk communication plans and mobilize communities\n  * Strengthen outbreak preparedness \n  * Strengthen overall immunization systems and improve routine vaccination coverage\n  * Plan and implement preventive supplemental immunization campaigns to increase population immunity \n  * Strengthen laboratory-supported measles surveillance\n  * Develop national action plans for measles elimination\n  * Monitor progress towards and verify achievement of measles elimination through the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination\n  * Produce Regional guidance for preparedness for and response to measles and rubella outbreaks.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of\nmorbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the\navailability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an\nincreasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks\nin countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the\nresurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization\ncoverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can\nspread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and\nlocal levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants\ntoo young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants\nand those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be\nprotected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates\n(> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care\nservices, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A\ndeficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease\nafter infection.\n\nGiven the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and\nresponse, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing\npossibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular\nmovement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or\nfrom measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles;\ncountries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and\nlocal level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.\n\nThe recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to\ngaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among\nsubpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and;\n4) vaccine hesitancy.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nMeasles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to\nonset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset\nan average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international\ntravel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case\npatients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the\nrash to 4 days after the rash erupts.\n\nWith ongoing measles outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the\nWPR urges Member States to refer to and implement the following published WHO\nguidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness\nand response to measles outbreaks, including detailed procedures for effective\nsurveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, which enable\nrapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:\n\nWPRO Measles Elimination Field Guide (2013)1 [pp. 25—33, 38—52]; and Regional\nStrategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western\nPacific (2018)2 [pp. 72—76].

Travel/contact history of cases is not yet known.\n\nFollowing a joint mission of Institut Pasteur, Paris and Association pour la\nMédecine Préventive (AMP) ) to investigate the epidemic meningitis situation,\n10 additional cases of N. meningitidis W135 were laboratory confirmed.\xa0 The\nsamples were taken from documented cases between 10-24 April 2001 and the\nproportion of N. meningitidis isolates belonging to the W135 serogroup was\nfound to be 37% of the total N. meningitidis isolates identified by PCR on\ncollected specimens.\xa0 None of the cases had any relationship with the 2001 Haj\npilgrimage (travel or contact history). \xa0 Among 4 strains that were cultured\nfrom the same period, 3 were W135:2a:P1-2,5 and belong to the ET-37 complex.\n\nNiger: A joint mission of Institut Pasteur, Paris and AMP investigated the\nepidemic meningitis situation and identified 10 laboratory confirmed cases of\nN. meningitidis W135. The samples were taken from documented cases between\n10-16 April 2001 and the proportion of N. meningitidis isolates belonging to\nthe W135 serogroup was found to be 40% of the total N. meningitidis isolates\nidentified by PCR on collected specimens. \xa0 None of the cases had any\nrelationship with the 2001 Haj pilgrimage (travel or contact history).\n\nCentral African Republic: 3 cases (Haj pilgrims) have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 have been laboratory confirmed.\n\nDenmark: 2 cases (one case close contact with Haj pilgrims, the travel/contact\nhistory of the second case is not yet known)have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nFrance: 2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nNorway: 4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nSaudi Arabia: 109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia)\nincluding 35 deaths have been reported between 9 February and 22 March 2001.\nN. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more than half\nof the cases.\n\nSingapore: 4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims, 1 history of travel to\nSaudi Arabia), including 1 death have been reported. Two of the cases occurred\nin January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 41 cases (8 pilgrims\nreturning from the Haj, 19 cases of close contacts and data outstanding on the\nremaining cases) including 11 deaths of laboratory confirmed invasive N.\nmeningitidis serogroup W135 have been reported.\n\nMeningococcal disease. As with all types of meningococcal disease, early\ndiagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group W135\nmeningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease: sudden\nonset of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting, photophobia and\nstiff neck. The most severe clinical form of the disease, meningococcal\nsepticaemia can be presented by abrupt onset, high fever, petechial rash or\npurpura.\n\nWHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close contacts of the cases,\nsuch as persons sleeping in the same dwelling.

These\nislands are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and are situated in the\nsouthern part of the Caribbean region, just north of the Venezuelan coast.\nAruba is an autonomous, self-governing constituent country of the Kingdom of\nthe Netherlands, while Bonaire is a special municipality of the Netherlands.\n\n### Bonaire\n\nOn 15 February, the National IHR Focal Point (IHR NFP) for the Netherlands\nreported one case of Zika virus infection in Bonaire. The case was confirmed\nby reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 12 February.\n\n### Aruba\n\nOn 16 February, IHR NFP for the Netherlands notified WHO of the first four\nautochthonous cases of Zika virus on the island of Aruba. The cases include\nthree resident islanders and a tourist. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR on\n15 February.\n\nAn additional seven cases of Zika virus infection have been identified in\nAruba. These reported cases acquired the infection in Brazil, Colombia and\nVenezuela.\n\nIn the continental part of the Netherlands, to date, 24 imported cases of Zika\nvirus infection have been confirmed. All patients were diagnosed following a\nvisit to Suriname or Aruba. All diagnoses were made by RT-PCR.\n\n### Public health response\n\nControl measures have been implemented by local public health authorities in\naccordance with WHO guidelines in both Bonaire and Aruba. Because of this\nimminent epidemic, during the past months, local authorities have intensified\nmosquito control programs.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThe detection of autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection indicates that\nthe virus is spreading geographically to previously unaffected areas (Bonaire\nand Aruba). The notification of autochthonous transmission in a new country\ndoes not change the overall risk assessment. The risk of a global spread of\nZika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are\npresent is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these\nmosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the\nepidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest\navailable information.\n\nDespite some reports of a potential association between Zika virus,\nmicrocephaly and other neurological disorders, at this stage, it is not\npossible to establish a causal relationship between these events. Until more\nis understood, Members States are advised to standardize and enhance\nsurveillance for microcephaly and other neurological disorders, particularly\nin areas of known Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such\ntransmission.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nThe proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a\nsignificant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control\nrelies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction\n(removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between\nmosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural\nand artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing\nthe adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using\nbarriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and\nrepellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission)\nare day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the\ndaytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under\nmosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide\nprotection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the\nlikelihood of being bitten.\n\nDuring outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following\nthe technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable\ninsecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be\nused as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is\ntechnically indicated.\n\nBasic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people\ntraveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of\nrepellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring\nrooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to countries or\nterritories within the Kingdom of the Netherlands based on the current\ninformation available.\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",8671,"('\n\nBetween 15 and 16 February 2016, WHO was notified of the first autochthonous\ncases of Zika virus infection on the islands of Bonaire and Aruba.

In fact, the epidemiological week ending 20 December saw\nover 5 000 new cases - an increase in the number of weekly cases relative to\nprevious weeks - and an increase in deaths outside treatment/health centres.\n\nThe overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has risen to 5.7% - far above the 1%\nwhich is normal in large outbreaks - and in some rural areas it has reached as\nhigh as 50%. Mortality outside of healthcare facilities remains very high.\nThis is a clear indication that better case management and access to\nhealthcare is needed - in particular an increased use of oral rehydration\ntherapy with Oral Rehydration Salts in communities very early after onset of\nthe disease.\n\nThe outbreak has taken on a subregional dimension with cases being reported\nfrom neighboring countries. In South Africa as of 26 December, 1 279\ncumulative cases and 12 deaths (CFR of 0.9%) had been recorded, with the bulk\nof the cases (1 194) in the Limpopo area. Cases have also been reported in\nBotswana (Palm Tree).\n\nThe current situation is closely linked to the lack of safe drinking water,\npoor sanitation, declining health infrastructure, and reduced numbers of\nhealthcare staff reporting to work. Other current risk factors include the\ncommencement of the rainy season and the movement of people within the\ncountry, and possibly across borders, during the Christmas season. WHO,\ntogether with the Ministry of Health and partners from the health and Water\nand Sanitation clusters, has established a cholera outbreak response\ncoordination unit in order to strengthen the reporting and early detection of\ncases, improve the response mechanism and access to healthcare and ensure\nproper case management.

Moreover, the use of\nthe internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not\nrecommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the\ntime required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics\nassociated to its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never\nbeen recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the occurrence\nof severe adverse events.\n\nIn controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any special\nrestrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. However,\nneighboring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance\nand preparedness systems.

Cases are now being reported from all 10 of the country's provinces. Harare, particularly Budiriro suburb in the south west, accounts for the majority of cases, followed by Beitbridge in Matabeleland South and Mudzi in Mashonaland East. The current outbreak is the largest ever recorded in Zimbabwe and is not yet under control. In fact, the epidemiological week ending 20 December saw over 5 000 new cases - an increase in the number of weekly cases relative to previous weeks - and an increase in deaths outside treatment/health centres. The overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has risen to 5.7% - far above the 1% which is normal in large outbreaks - and in some rural areas it has reached as high as 50%. Mortality outside of healthcare facilities remains very high. This is a clear indication that better case management and access to healthcare is needed - in particular an increased use of oral rehydration therapy with Oral Rehydration Salts in communities very early after onset of the disease. The outbreak has taken on a subregional dimension with cases being reported from neighboring countries. In South Africa as of 26 December, 1 279 cumulative cases and 12 deaths (CFR of 0.9%) had been recorded, with the bulk of the cases (1 194) in the Limpopo area. Cases have also been reported in Botswana (Palm Tree). The current situation is closely linked to the lack of safe drinking water, poor sanitation, declining health infrastructure, and reduced numbers of healthcare staff reporting to work. Other current risk factors include the commencement of the rainy season and the movement of people within the country, and possibly across borders, during the Christmas season. WHO, together with the Ministry of Health and partners from the health and Water and Sanitation clusters, has established a cholera outbreak response coordination unit in order to strengthen the reporting and early detection of cases, improve the response mechanism and access to healthcare and ensure proper case management. WHO has also deployed experts in public health, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization. In light of the extent and pace of expansion of the outbreak, reinforcing all control activities across the country is critical. Given the current dynamic of the outbreak and the context of the collapsed health system, a cholera vaccination is not recommended. Moreover, the use of the internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated to its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the occurrence of severe adverse events. In controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. However, neighboring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.

Three of these cases are in Nigeria and include two new probable cases — one is a health-care worker and one is a Nigerian who travelled to Guinea — and a suspected case in a nurse. National authorities in Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo continue to work closely with WHO and its partners in identification of contacts and contact tracing as well as in preparing response plans as a result of the recent visit by and death of a Liberian national to Nigeria from EVD and the new Nigerian EVD probable case, who travelled to Guinea. ### Health sector response The Director-General of the World Health Organization visited Guinea and held high-level meetings with the Presidents of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to review the status of the Ebola epidemic and adopt common strategies to eradicate Ebola from the sub-region. A Joint Declaration of Heads of State and Government of the Mano River Union (comprised of Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) was issued and leaders pledged to commit additional resources to the outbreak. This will include the following measures: * Actions at the inter-country level to focus on cross-border regions, including isolation of specific areas by police and military and material support to the citizens in these areas. Health-care centers in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing, and contact tracing. Burials will be done in accordance with national health regulations. * Provision of incentives, treatment, and protection for health personnel so they can feel safe in their jobs and perform their duties. In addition, security for national and international personnel supporting the fight against Ebola will also be assured. * A commitment by Heads of State to do their part to bring the outbreak to an end as soon as possible. To this end, the international community will support affected countries to build capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, case management, and laboratory capacity. * Mobilization of the private and public sectors to work in synergy and increase sensitization efforts to enable communities to understand EVD for effective and efficient eradication. * Involve all sectors in immediate implementation of necessary interventions outlined in national response plans; harmonize and coordinate these measures; deploy national and international human resources with appropriate skills; mobilize and allocate appropriate financial resources; strengthen surveillance of cross-border movement. * Improve information and communications systems in an effort to strengthen sensitization and promote community participation, taking into account cultural contexts. * Improve infection prevention and control measures in all treatment centres to prevent health personnel from contracting and dying from EVD. * Put in place a monitoring and evaluation system of regional strategies and conduct research around the disease. Human and financial resource mobilization continues to be sought from WHO’s partners, UN agencies, and other stakeholders. On Friday, WHO and the affected countries issued the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan in West Africa covering Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, neighbouring states, and other countries in the region from July-December 2014.

This\nupdate provides additional information on the clinical findings as well as the\nepidemiological and laboratory investigations of these cases.\n\nBetween October 2013 and April 2014, French Polynesia experienced the largest\nZika virus outbreak ever recorded in the country. During this period of time,\n32,000 patients (11.5% of the population) were assessed for the infection and\n8,750 suspected cases were reported by the national surveillance system. Of\nthe suspected cases, 383 were later laboratory-confirmed by reverse\ntranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\nDuring the Zika virus outbreak, 42 patients were admitted to hospital with\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This represents a 20-fold increase in incidence\nof GBS in French Polynesia compared with the previous four years. Of the 42\npatients, 16 (38%) required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 12\n(29%) received mechanical ventilation. The duration of hospital stay for\npatients that were not admitted to ICU ranged between 7 to 20 days\n(median=11). The duration of hospital stay for patients that were admitted to\nintensive care went from 16 to 70 days (median=51). No deaths were reported.\nThe majority of these cases (88%) reported symptomatic Zika virus infection in\nthe days (median=6) that preceded the onset of neurological symptoms.\n\nFurther investigations were carried out to identify the potential role of\nprevious infections known to be associated, or potentially associated, with\nGBS. The investigations carried out by the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire-\nDirection de la Santé de Polynésie Française showed that 41 of the 42 cases of\nGBS (98%) had IgM or IgG antibodies against Zika virus; furthermore, all GBS\ncases (100%) had positive seroneutralisation against Zika virus. Results for\nthe matched non-febrile illness control group were significantly different:\nelevated IgM or IgG antibodies were detected in 35 of the 98 control patients\n(36%); additionally, neutralising antibodies against Zika virus were detected\nin 54 control patients (56%).\n\nAnalysis of dengue serology (immunofluorescent assay, microsphere immunoassay,\nand seroneutralisation) did not support recent dengue infection, even though\nmost cases (95%) had pre-existing dengue immunity. Other known causes of GBS\nwere investigated and excluded, including Campylobacter jejuni,\nCytomegalovirus, HIV, Epstein–Barr and Herpes simplex viruses.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThis is the first report of a large number of patients who developed GBS after\ncontracting Zika virus. The study provides strong evidence of a possible\ncausal relationship between Zika virus infection and GBS. Since all 42 cases\nhad serological tests suggesting successive dengue and Zika virus infections,\nthis association might be a predisposing factor for developing GBS. Further\ninvestigations are needed to understand the implications of pre-existing\ndengue infections, together with recent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis\nof GBS.\n\nSimilarly to French Polynesia, it is likely that countries that are currently\nreporting autochthonous Zika virus transmission will face a rise in the number\nof GBS cases in the coming months. A number of countries in Latin America have\nalready started to report an increase in the incidence of GBS while\nexperiencing a rise in the cases of Zika virus infection. Nevertheless, it is\ncritical to ensure that in all these countries, the reported increases in the\nincidence of GBS are the result of a real change rather than enhanced\nsurveillance. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and\nconduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nWHO recommends Member States affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks\nto:\n\n  * monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values; \n  * develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome;\n  * raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors.\n\nThe proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a\nsignificant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control\nrelies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction\n(removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between\nmosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural\nand artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing\nthe adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using\nbarriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and\nrepellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission)\nare day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the\ndaytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under\nmosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide\nprotection.\n\nDuring outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following\nthe technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable\ninsecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be\nused as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is\ntechnically indicated.\n\nBasic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people\ntraveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of\nrepellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring\nrooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to France and its\noverseas departments based on the current information available.\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",10212,"('\n\nOn 24 November 2015, health authorities in French Polynesia reported unknown\nand unspecified causes of morbidity and mortality in the context of\nconcomitant outbreaks of Zika and dengue (serotypes 1 and 3) viruses.

During this period, a total of 207 probable and\nconfirmed cases were reported from Katwa (83), Vuhovi (41), Mandima (29), Beni\n(21), Butembo (15), Oicha (8), Masereka (4), Lubero (2), Musienene (2),\nKalunguta (1), and Mabalako (1).\n\nAs of 9 April, a total of 1186 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been\nreported, of which 751 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1186 cases with\nreported age and sex, 57% (675) were female, and 29% (341) were children aged\nless than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 87\n(7% of total cases), including 31 deaths. To date, a total of 354 EVD patients\nwho received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.\n\nWHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened the Emergency\nCommittee for a meeting on 12 April, to consider whether the current EVD\noutbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to\nprovide recommendations.\n\nProgress on the ground this week focused primarily on intensifying infection\nprevention and control (IPC) activities in and around outbreak hotspot areas.\nIPC teams are concentrating their efforts at addressing reluctance to\ndecontamination activities amongst some local residents by actively engaging\nin regular direct dialogues with community leaders. Along with intensifying\ndecontamination efforts, other IPC measures being undertaken include rapid\nevaluation of IPC practices in healthcare facilities and patients’ homes and\nidentifying facilities at increased risk of contact with EVD cases. Results\nfrom these rapid evaluations demonstrated a range of IPC gaps depending on the\ntype of facility, which were then promptly addressed through supplementary\nsupervision. Reoccurring issues include limited knowledge of standard\nprecautions, lack of triage and isolation capacity, insufficient supplies\n(e.g., of personal protective equipment), inappropriate waste management, and\nlack of capacity for decontaminating medical equipment. These findings\nhighlight the importance of maintaining supportive supervision and mentorship\nat priority facilities throughout the response. WHO is confident that\nstrengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the\nspread of EVD in the outbreak areas.\n\nWHO and partners in Risk Communication and Community Engagement are continuing\nwith activities to build and maintain a trusting relationship between\ncommunities and the Ebola response teams. Dialogues with community committees\nare ongoing in the hotspot areas of Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi, and form a key\npart of a larger increase ownership of the Ebola response by the communities.\nInformation about community disquiet are systematically collected and\nmonitored to ensure that any misunderstanding leading to reluctance, refusal,\nor resistance of the Ebola response is followed up with and resolved as\nquickly as possible. This has been made possible by feedback from the\ncommunity members, received through ongoing dialogue and various research\nactivities within both the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring\nareas.\n\nIn an effort to address the feedback received and specific concerns over the\noutbreak response, guided visits of the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) in\nvarious affected areas have been organized. Students and community\nassociations who attended these guided visits to the ETCs can see first-hand\nhow EVD patients are treated and help stop the potential dissemination of\nmisinformation surrounding EVD and the ongoing response efforts.\n\nThe security situation has remained calm for the past week as well.\nProvisional results released on 9 April by the Commission Électorale Nationale\nIndépendante concerning the national and provincial legislative elections in\nBeni, Butembo city (North Kivu), and Yumbi territory (Mai-Ndombe) have caused\nno significant unrest or disruption to outbreak response activities.\n\nThe continued increase in cases this past week reflects the complex reality of\nconducting an effective outbreak response in a geographically difficult area\nwith a highly fluid population, intermittent attacks by armed groups, and\nlimited healthcare infrastructure. Despite these challenges, WHO and partners\nremain committed to limiting the spread of EVD amongst these vulnerable\npopulations through the continued strengthening of our multi-faceted response\nefforts.\n\n#### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of\nillness onset, data as of 9 April 2019*\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.\n\n#### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health\narea, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data\nas of 9 April 2019\n\nEnlarge image  \n\n### Table 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of\nhealth areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces,\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 9 April 2019**\n\nEnlarge image  \n\n**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on\nthe initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and\ndaily reporting by the Ministry of Health.\n\n### Public health response\n\nFor further detailed information about the public health response actions by\nthe MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports\npublished by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:\n\n  * Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nWHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context\nof the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the\nevolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and\nregional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.\nAttacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and\norganized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a\ndifferent order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers\nof being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the\npersistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political\ntensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and\ndelays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas;\nreducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of\ncommunity deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in\ndetection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and\nresponse to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further\nchains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of\ngeographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to\nneighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement\nanticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nInternational traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and\ntrade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently\navailable information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect\npeople from the Ebola virus.

Along with intensifying\ndecontamination efforts, other IPC measures being undertaken include rapid\nevaluation of IPC practices in healthcare facilities and patients’ homes and\nidentifying facilities at increased risk of contact with EVD cases. Results\nfrom these rapid evaluations demonstrated a range of IPC gaps depending on the\ntype of facility, which were then promptly addressed through supplementary\nsupervision. Reoccurring issues include limited knowledge of standard\nprecautions, lack of triage and isolation capacity, insufficient supplies\n(e.g., of personal protective equipment), inappropriate waste management, and\nlack of capacity for decontaminating medical equipment. These findings\nhighlight the importance of maintaining supportive supervision and mentorship\nat priority facilities throughout the response. WHO is confident that\nstrengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the\nspread of EVD in the outbreak areas.\n\nWHO and partners in Risk Communication and Community Engagement are continuing\nwith activities to build and maintain a trusting relationship between\ncommunities and the Ebola response teams.

The disease causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts\nof Benin, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. Although,\nthis is only the second Lassa outbreak reported in Benin, the outbreak is\noccurring during known seasonal patterns.

The Lassa virus is\ntransmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated\nwith rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory\ntransmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate\ninfection prevent and control measures. The disease is endemic in the rodent\npopulation in parts of West Africa. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in\nBenin (where it was diagnosed for the first time in November 2014), Guinea,\nLiberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other\nWest African countries as well. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%. Observed\ncase-fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa\nfever is 15%.

Of these, 156 have died. Cases have now been\nreported from five provinces. Uige remains the epicentre of the outbreak.\nWhile children under the age of 5 years initially accounted for around 75% of\ncases, recent cases are including an increasing number of adults.\n\nOne person is currently under investigation for Marburg haemorrhagic fever in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAssessment of the outbreak\n\nWHO is concerned about the further evolution of the outbreak of Marburg\nhaemorrhagic fever in Angola, and this concern is fully shared by the\ngovernment. Following confirmation of Marburg virus as the causative agent, on\n21 March, WHO sent its senior epidemiologists to Uige to assess the situation\nand organize an initial emergency response. That assessment prompted a rapid\nand massive augmentation of support in the form of international teams of\nspecialized staff, presently in Uige and Luanda, and several shipments of\nsupplies. Staff have been drawn from WHO and its partners in the Global\nOutbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Equipment to strengthen local\ndiagnostic and communication capacity is also now in place.\n\nThis escalation of support is continuing, with the government making great\nefforts to facilitate the rapid influx of staff and supplies and set up the\nbasic infrastructure for a sustained emergency response.\n\nWHO has acquired extensive experience in the successful control of viral\nhaemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, a closely-related disease that is\nclinically almost identical. Based on this experience, WHO remains confident\nthat the outbreak can be brought under control. At the same time, however, the\nimplementation of effective control measures faces several significant\nchallenges, some of which may be unique to this outbreak.\n\nMarburg haemorrhagic fever is an extremely rare disease that remains poorly\nunderstood. Information on the behaviour of Marburg virus once it enters a\nhuman population is sparse. As detailed in a fact sheet recently issued by\nWHO, the outbreak in Angola is one of only two large outbreaks of this disease\nthat have occurred in indigenous African populations since the virus was first\ndetected in 1967. The only other large outbreak, which began in late 1998 in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, was confined to two sparsely populated\nvillages in an isolated corner of the country, caused sporadic cases with\nsmall chains of transmission over two years, and never reached the intensity\nof transmission seen in just the past few weeks in Angola.

WHO has arranged three shipments of this equipment\nto date; more shipments are on their way. Personal protective equipment is\nalso being supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\nMédecins sans Frontières, and UNICEF.

WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom\nGhebreyesus, and Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, commends\nthe country and partners in the response against the outbreak while urging\nthem to extend this success to combatting other diseases in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\n\nIn contrast to previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks in the country, this\noutbreak involved three health zones, including an urban centre with river\nconnections to the capital and to neighbouring countries, as well as remote\nrainforest villages. Within hours of the outbreak being declared on 8 May\n2018, WHO advanced more than US$2 million from its Contingency Fund for\nEmergencies, deployed a team to augment capacity in the field, and activated\nan emergency incident management system. More than two-thirds of the 360\npeople deployed to respond came from within the WHO African Region, including\nvaccination teams from Guinea.\n\nFrom 20 through 21 July 2018, WHO supported a workshop to harmonize, reconcile\nand validate the wide range of data arising from the outbreak response. The\nworkshop brought together teams responsible for coordination, surveillance,\ncase management, laboratory investigations and vaccinations in Mbandaka,\nBikoro, Itipo, Iboko and Kinshasa to share their findings, and harmonize data\nrecords. As a result of this exercise, changes to the number of confirmed and\nprobable cases, including deaths among these cases, were agreed. These changes\nonly affected the reclassification of data records of past cases, who were\notherwise known to field investigators and received full follow-up as part of\nthe response.\n\nAs of 24 July 2018, a total of 54 Ebola virus disease cases (38 confirmed and\n16 probable) were reported, with illness onset between 5 April and 2 June 2018\n(Figure 1). Of these cases, 33 died (overall case fatality ratio: 61%),\nincluding 17 deaths among confirmed cases. Cases were reported from three\nhealth zones (Figure 2): Bikoro (n=21; 10 confirmed, 11 probable), Iboko\n(n=29; 24 confirmed, 5 probable), and Wangata (n=4; all confirmed). Seven\ncases were health care workers, of whom two died.\n\n#### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by\nepidemiological week of illness onset, Democratic Republic of the Congo, from\n5 April through 24 July 2018 (n=54)\n\n#### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health\nzone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 5 April through 24 July 2018 (n=54)\n\n### Public health response\n\nFrom 3 through 5 July 2018, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and\npartners, conducted a strategic operations review to assess the current\nepidemiological situation, evaluate progress against the Ebola virus disease\nStrategic Response Plan, engage in initial lesson learning, and prioritize key\nactivities and resources for continued vigilance in affected areas. A key\nproduct of the operations review was the development of a government-led\nConsolidation and Stabilization Plan (August – October 2018) to transition\nresources deployed, strengthen emergency response capacity and preparedness,\nand overall resilience of the health systems. This plan includes:\n\n  * Maintaining and strengthening surveillance capacity to rapidly detect and respond to potential new cases of Ebola virus disease, including for points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and in neighbouring provinces and countries; \n  * Strengthening infection prevention and control, as well as Water, Sanitation, and Health (WASH), in targeted health facilities; \n  * Maintaining evidence-based standards for case management (clinical care of patients and access to monitored use of investigational therapeutics);\n  * Maintaining local laboratory capacity for confirmation of new potential cases and management of care to survivors;\n  * Providing health services and psychosocial care for survivors and their families;\n  * Strengthening community engagement to improve knowledge of and response to Ebola and epidemic-prone diseases in targeted health zones;\n  * Improving food security in health zones affected by Ebola virus disease;\n  * Leveraging resources and knowledge from the first two phases of the response to facilitate the development of a National Health Security and Resilience Plan, based on previous assessments and the after action review which is planned from 10 through 14 September 2018. \n\nAs part of this next phase of the public health response, WHO will support the\nMinistry of Health in leading an After-Action Review with partners and donors\nto engage in lessons learning and determine how best to leverage resources and\nknowledge from the first two phases of the response to strengthen health\nsystems and national resilience under a National Action Plan for Heath\nSecurity.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThe latest WHO assessment concluded that the current Ebola virus disease\noutbreak has been contained, considering that 42 days (two maximum incubation\nperiods) have elapsed since the date of the second negative test of the last\ncase confirmed case on 12 June 2018. Under the Consolidation and Stabilisation\nStrategic Plan adopted by the Ministry for Health, enhanced surveillance, a\nprogram for long-term Ebola survivor care and other response mechanisms,\nremain in place following the end of the outbreak declaration to maintain\nincreased vigilance and contribute to resilience of the health system. WHO\nconsiders the public health risk associated with the recent Ebola virus\ndisease outbreak to be low at national, regional and global levels.

Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.\n  * Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.\n  * Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission, based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended.

Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the current information available. ',)",3459,27-may-2016-lassa-fever-nigeria-en,197,1219

Diagnostic testing was initially delayed by problems encountered in the shipment of samples from Iraq. Most of these problems have now been solved. To date, poultry outbreaks of H5 avian influenza have been confirmed in Sulaimaniyah and Missan provinces. Both outbreaks are thought to have begun in mid-January. ',)",924,2006_03_01a-en,200,1419

Thirty-one per cent\nhad had moderate or severe rash, i.e. more than 100 skin lesions, and in 41%\nthe eruption lasted longer than one week.

She may have visited a gold mining\narea near St. Elie (North center of the country). Investigations are currently\nongoing in order to identify the patient's travel route.\n\nOn 21 August 2017, the case was laboratory confirmed at the national reference\ncenter for arboviruses, Institut Pasteur Cayenne by RT-PCR. This is the first\nconfirmed case diagnosed in this territory since 1998.\n\nIn French Guiana, yellow fever is considered endemic. The overall immunization\ncoverage is good as yellow fever vaccination is mandatory but immunization\ncoverage might be low in specific populations like clandestine and illegal\nworkers.

These include health facilities in Cayenne and Kourou, localities of the interior around Saint Elie, and in the Bas-Oyapock river area.\n  * The feasibility of vaccination catch-up targeting workers in legal and illegal gold mining areas is considered.\n  * Communication and messages on prevention measures for yellow fever are being disseminated in French Guiana, including to people who live in those areas.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nYellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that has the potential to\nspread rapidly and cause serious public health impacts in unimmunized\npopulations.

A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed.\n  * Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites.\n  * Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever in general population.\n  * Promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present).\n\nThis case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the\nneed for yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with favorable\necosystem for yellow fever transmission.\n\nYellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization provided that\nvaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel.

After discussion and\ndeliberation on the information provided, the Committee advised that:\n\n  * the Ebola outbreak in West Africa constitutes an ‘extraordinary event’ and a public health risk to other States; \n  * the possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries.\n  * a coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola.\n\nIt was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public\nHealth Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met. The entire\nstatement, including a list of temporary recommendations, can be found at\nhttp://who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en/.\n\nOn Friday, 8 August, the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, gave a press\nbriefing to the international media from WHO Headquarters. Dr Chan will give\nan additional briefing on the situation of the outbreak and the ongoing\nresponse in the region to the Permanent and Observer Missions to the United\nNations and other international organizations in Geneva on Tuesday, 12 August.\nPermanent Representatives of the affected countries have been invited to speak\non behalf of their respective Governments on the national Ebola response and\npriorities.\n\nOn Monday, 11 August, WHO will convene a panel of medical ethics experts to\nbegin looking at the use of experimental treatments in the ongoing EVD\noutbreak in West Africa. At this time, there are no registered medicines or\nvaccines against this deadly virus; several experimental options are currently\nunder development, though. The recent treatment of two health workers from US\nfaith-based aid organizations has raised questions about whether medicines\nthat have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans should be used in\noutbreak situations. In the case of Ebola, supplies are extremely limited,\nwhich then raises questions about who should receive it, if it’s used.\n\n### Disease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the\nMinistries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Between 5\nand 6 August 2014, 68 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect\ncases) of EVD and 29 deaths were reported from the four countries as follows:\nGuinea, 0 new cases and 4 deaths; Liberia, 38 new cases and 12 deaths;\nNigeria, 4 new cases and 1 death; and Sierra Leone, 26 new cases and 12\ndeaths.\n\nAs of 6 August 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the\nfour countries stands at 1 779, including 961 deaths.

It is estimated that more than 30 000 people have fallen ill with\nacute watery diarrhoea, among which 2 116 were identified as positive for\nVibrio cholerae.  The case fatality rate is 0.52% and has remained low\nthroughout the outbreak, although it continues to spread across Iraq and\ndissemination to as yet unaffected areas remains highly possible.\n\nThe outbreak was first detected in Kirkuk province, where 68% of laboratory-\nconfirmed cholera cases have so far been reported, and then spread to\nSulaymaniah and Erbil provinces. Additional isolated cases of Cholera have\nalso been identified in other parts of the country, including Tikrit (6 cases\nconfirmed), Mosul (2 cases confirmed), Basra (1 case confirmed), Baghdad (2\ncases confirmed) and Dahuk (1 case confirmed).\n\nThe Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the\noutbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive\nmeasures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put\nin place.

As one of the response elements,\nWHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub-\nregion scheduled for 2–3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The meeting will bring\ntogether Ministers of Health and the Directors of disease prevention and\ncontrol from 11 African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal,\nSierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors,\nrepresentatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities.\nThe objective of the meeting is to analyse the situation, identify gaps,\ndevelop operational response plans, and to ensure increased political\ncommitment and enhanced cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities\namong the countries in the sub-region.\n\nWHO and technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network\n(GOARN), including the EU Mobile Laboratory consortium, the IFRC, and national\nsocieties, Institut Pasteur Dakar, Institut Pasteur Lyon, Institut Pasteur\nParis, Bernard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors\nwithout Borders, Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health England, and US\nCDC, together with UN agencies, DFID, EU, ECHO, and other partners are\nproviding the necessary technical expertise and support to the Ministries of\nHealth to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus.\n\nWHO is closely supporting the Ministries of Health through the deployment of\nadditional experts in various specialties, providing field logistics support,\nand personal protective equipment and medical supplies. These experts are\ndrawn from WHO offices, GOARN partners, specialised networks, especially in\nthe region, and include:\n\n  * Field epidemiologists, who are working with the countries in surveillance and monitoring of the outbreak; \n  * Laboratory experts who are providing mobile field laboratories in early confirmation of Ebola cases;\n  * Clinical management experts who are deployed to health facilities and are treating affected patients;\n  * Infection and prevention control experts who are helping countries in their ongoing efforts to stop transmission of the virus in the community and health-care facilities;\n  * Logisticians who are ensuring an operational response platform, and dispatching essential equipment and needed materials; and \n  * Social mobilization and risk communications teams who are helping public health officials to develop and deliver appropriate messages about how to report, handle, and treat Ebola cases.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea,\nLiberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this\nevent.\n\n### Disease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be\nreported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of\nGuinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

These factors include transmission of EVD in rural communities, facilitated by strong cultural practices and traditional beliefs; transmission of EVD in densely populated peri-urban areas of Conakry in Guinea and Monrovia in Liberia; and cross-border transmission of EVD along the border areas of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where commercial and social activities continue among the border areas of these countries. ### Health sector response Containment of this outbreak requires a strong response in the countries and especially along their shared border areas. As one of the response elements, WHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub- region scheduled for 2–3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The meeting will bring together Ministers of Health and the Directors of disease prevention and control from 11 African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors, representatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities. The objective of the meeting is to analyse the situation, identify gaps, develop operational response plans, and to ensure increased political commitment and enhanced cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO and technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), including the EU Mobile Laboratory consortium, the IFRC, and national societies, Institut Pasteur Dakar, Institut Pasteur Lyon, Institut Pasteur Paris, Bernard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors without Borders, Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health England, and US CDC, together with UN agencies, DFID, EU, ECHO, and other partners are providing the necessary technical expertise and support to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. WHO is closely supporting the Ministries of Health through the deployment of additional experts in various specialties, providing field logistics support, and personal protective equipment and medical supplies. These experts are drawn from WHO offices, GOARN partners, specialised networks, especially in the region, and include: * Field epidemiologists, who are working with the countries in surveillance and monitoring of the outbreak; * Laboratory experts who are providing mobile field laboratories in early confirmation of Ebola cases; * Clinical management experts who are deployed to health facilities and are treating affected patients; * Infection and prevention control experts who are helping countries in their ongoing efforts to stop transmission of the virus in the community and health-care facilities; * Logisticians who are ensuring an operational response platform, and dispatching essential equipment and needed materials; and * Social mobilization and risk communications teams who are helping public health officials to develop and deliver appropriate messages about how to report, handle, and treat Ebola cases. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 25 and 30 June 2014, 22 new cases of EVD, including 14 deaths, were reported from the three countries, as follows: Guinea, 3 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 8 new cases with 7 deaths; and Sierra Leone 11 new cases and 2 deaths. These numbers include laboratory- confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 30 June 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 759, including 467 deaths.

Both cases are under investigation to determine whether\nthey meet the Brighton Collaboration case definition for GBS.\n\n### Details of the cases\n\n  * The first case is an elderly male resident of the United States with recent travel to Central America. He developed an acute febrile illness shortly after returning to the U.S. and was subsequently hospitalized in January with progressive ascending weakness of the extremities and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He improved following treatment and was ready to be discharged. However, he experienced a sudden subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm and died. \n  * The second case is an adult male resident of Haiti who experienced an acute onset of facial weakness, difficulty swallowing, and numbness of fingers in early January. No antecedent illness was reported. A few days later, he travelled to the United States for additional medical care. Cerebrospinal fluid had elevated protein and normal white blood cells. Physical examination showed mild weakness and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by serology. He improved with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and was discharged. \n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nTo date, a total of 9 countries or territories have reported an increased\nincidence of GBS and/or laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection among\nGBS cases. This is the first time that a country with no vector borne\ntransmission of Zika virus detects patients with concomitant GBS and Zika\nvirus infection. These cases provide additional evidence of a possible causal\nrelationship between Zika virus and GBS. Further investigations are needed to\nunderstand the implications of pre-existing dengue infections, together with\nrecent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis of GBS.\n\nIt is likely that countries that are currently reporting autochthonous Zika\nvirus transmission will face a rise in the number of GBS cases in the coming\nmonths. However, it is critical to ensure that in all these countries the\nreported increases in the incidence of GBS are the result of a real change\nrather than enhanced surveillance. WHO continues to monitor the\nepidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest\navailable information.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nWHO recommends Member States affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks\nto:\n\n  * monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values; \n  * develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome;\n  * raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors.\n\nThe proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a\nsignificant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control\nrelies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction\n(removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between\nmosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural\nand artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing\nthe adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using\nbarriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and\nrepellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission)\nare day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the\ndaytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under\nmosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide\nprotection.\n\nDuring outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following\nthe technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable\ninsecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be\nused as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is\ntechnically indicated.\n\nBasic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people\ntraveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of\nrepellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring\nrooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.\n\nBased on the current available information, WHO does not recommend any travel\nor trade restrictions to the United States of America.\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",8970,"('\n\nOn 10 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America\nnotified PAHO/WHO of 2 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with confirmed\nZika virus infection.

As of 9 June\n2017, a total of 501 suspected cases including 104 deaths have been reported\nsince the onset of the current Lassa fever outbreaks season in December 2016.\nOf the reported cases, 189 have been further classified, 175 laboratory-\nconfirmed including 59 deaths and 14 probable cases (all dead).\n\nDuring the current Lassa fever outbreak, 17 Nigerian states (Anambra, Bauchi,\nBorno, Cross-River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Kogi, Nasarawa,\nOgun, Ondo, Plateau, Rivers, and Taraba) have reported at least one confirmed\ncase. As of 9 June 2017, the outbreak is still active in nine states (Anambra,\nBauchi, Cross-River, Edo, Taraba, Nasarawa, Ondo, Plateau, and Kano).\n\n### Public health response\n\nThe ongoing outbreak response is focused at State and federal levels and\ninvolves coordination of weekly Lassa fever review meeting in conjunction with\nWorld Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), and the African\nField Epidemiology Network.\n\nThe following response measures are being carried out:\n\n  * Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all affected states and Lassa fever cases are reported to the federal level and contact tracing is ongoing in affected states with an active outbreak through the state surveillance team. \n  * The line listing of cases reported across all the states is ongoing and data are uploaded in the VHF database. \n  * Lassa fever treatment centers have been established in the affected states to support case management. These centers are supplied with case management as well as infection prevention and control supplies.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness. Lassa fever is\ntransmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated\nwith rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory\ntransmission can also occur. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and other West\nAfrican countries and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of\nthe region, with yearly peaks observed between December and June.\n\nOverall, the current risk assessment for Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows\na declining trend of outbreaks. Considering this, ongoing response measures\nremains focused on preparedness and response in general and further risk of\nlarge scale outbreaks is not very high. However, a close follow up, active\ncase searching, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (in\nthe community and for health care workers) should remain ongoing. Although\nthere is constant population movement between these Nigerian states, a large-\nscale disease transmission or outbreak spread has not been reported. However,\nthere have been sporadic cases reported in Togo and Benin originating from\nNigeria.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good “community hygiene” to\ndiscourage rodents from entering homes. In health-care settings, staff should\nalways apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring\nfor patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.\n\nOn rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export\nthe disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much\nmore common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile\npatients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in\nrural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be\nendemic.

However, it is the first time that the Cusco Region records cases of\nOropouche fever.

At present, the possibility of further cases being detected in the Cusco\nRegion and in the rest of Peru cannot be excluded. Given the wide geographical\ndistribution of the competent vector in the Region of the Americas, the risk\nof cases being identified in other countries is significant. WHO continues to\nmonitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on\nthe latest available information.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nGiven its clinical presentation, Oropouche fever should be included in the\nclinical differential diagnosis for other common arboviral diseases (e.g.,\nchikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Zika virus).\n\nThe proximity of midge vector breeding to human habitation is a significant\nrisk factor for Oropouche virus infection. Prevention and control relies on\nreducing the breeding of midges through source reduction (removal and\nmodification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between midges and\npeople. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial\nwater-filled habitats that support midge larvae, reducing the adult midge\npopulations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect\nscreens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents.\n\n### Background\n\nOropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus. In humans, it is transmitted\nprimarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. No direct\ntransmission of the virus from human to human has been documented.\n\nOropouche fever causes symptoms similar to those of dengue with an incubation\nperiod of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of\nhigh fever, headache, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting. In some patients it\ncan cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis.\n\nIn the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche fever virus have been reported from\nrural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and\nTobago.\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",7462,"('\n\nOn 2 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Peru reported 57 cases of Oropouche\nfever.

The geographical distribution of these\ncases and deaths is as follows: Conakry, 67 cases and 29 deaths; Gueckedou,\n194 cases and 146 deaths; Macenta, 45 cases and 27 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and\n4 deaths; Kissidougou, 7 cases and 5 deaths; Dinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death;\nTelimele, 25 cases and 7 deaths; Boffa, 7 cases and 6 deaths; and Kouroussa, 1\ncase and 1 death.\n\nIn terms of isolation, 33 patients are currently hospitalized (8 in Conakry, 9\nin Gueckedou, 15 in Telimele, and 1 in Boffa). The number of contacts\ncurrently being followed-up countrywide is 1011 distributed as follows:\nConakry, 329 contacts; Gueckedou, 317 contacts; Macenta, 176 contacts;\nTelimele, 111 contacts; and Boffa, 78 contacts.\n\n### Liberia\n\nNo new cases have been reported from Liberia, however 11 contacts (5 health-\ncare workers and 6 community relatives) are currently being followed-up. These\ncontacts were of the probable case from nearby Kailahun, Sierra Leone who died\nin Foya, Liberia. The deceased was taken back to Kailahun for burial.\n\n### Sierra Leone\n\nAs of 18:00 on 6 June 2014, 8 new cases (2 confirmed and 6 suspected) and 1\nnew death were reported from Kailahun (3 cases and 1 death), Kenema (1 case\nand 0 deaths), Bo (1 case and 0 deaths), Port Loko (1 case and 0 deaths), and\nFreetown (2 cases and 0 deaths). This brings the total number of EVD clinical\ncases to 89 (33 confirmed, 3 probable, and 53 suspected) including 7 deaths.\nAll 33 confirmed cases and 7 deaths were reported from Kailahun district. The\nnumber of cases among health-care workers is 5 and deaths is 1. There are\ncurrently 11 cases in isolation at Kenema Hospital. The number of contacts\ncurrently being followed-up is 30.\n\nCommunity resistance is hindering the identification and follow-up of\ncontacts.\n\nOverall, the total number of cases is subject to change due to\nreclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and\nlaboratory data and enhanced surveillance.\n\n### WHO response\n\nWHO and partners continue to support the implementation of preventive and\ncontrol measures in the affected countries.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, WHO is training health-care workers on case and data\nmanagement and in reviewing messages for social mobilization.\n\nCurrently, there is only 1 isolation facility located at Kenema.

All three patients are girls,\ntwo of whom are approximately two-years-old and one is eight-years-old. All\nhad previously been immunized with oral polio vaccine (OPV).\n\nTwo of the patients are from North Bahr El Gazal state (close to the border\nwith Sudan), and one is from Eastern Equatoria state (close to the border with\nKenya and Uganda). They developed paralysis between 15-24 August 2013. Genetic\nsequencing is ongoing to provide final confirmation of the laboratory results\nto determine the origin of the isolated viruses.\n\nThe Horn of Africa is currently experiencing an outbreak of WPV1, with 174\ncases in Somalia, 14 cases in Kenya and three cases in Ethiopia. Because of\nthe routes of poliovirus spread in previous Horn of Africa outbreaks, South\nSudan had been considered at high risk of re-infection. In 2013, South Sudan\nconducted two National Immunization Days (NIDs) in March 2013 and April 2013,\nwith additional NIDs planned for November 2013 and December 2013. Subnational\nImmunization Days (SNIDs) were conducted in August 2013.\n\nContingency plans for an emergency outbreak response are currently being\nfinalized, including an immediate supplementary immunization activity (SIA) in\nand around the infected areas.\n\nAn international team of experts is being deployed to South Sudan, to assist\nthe local authorities in further case investigations, planning for appropriate\noutbreak response, and further intensifying active searches for additional\npotential cases.\n\nImmunization rates in neighbouring Sudan and Uganda are also being assessed to\ndetermine overall population immunity levels. As needed, additional SIAs will\nbe conducted to help fill any identified immunity gaps.

The first three cases were residents of Nigeria from\nJibiya Local Government Area (LGA) in Katsina State on the border with Niger.\nThe cases were all from the same family and reportedly had an onset of\nsymptoms in Jibiya LGA before seeking treatment on 5 July 2018 at a health\nfacility in a bordering town in Niger. Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 Inaba was\nconfirmed in stool samples from all three cases, one of which died within\nminutes of admission. In addition to these cases, six cases were reported in\nthe following two days from villages in Niger located approximately 4km away\nfrom Jibiya LGA. Since then, the outbreak has continuously expanded\ngeographically and in magnitude with peaks of around 400 cases reported in two\nweeks in August and in early September.\n\nAs of 1 October 2018, 3692 cases (14% of these were cases in Nigerian\nresidents seeking care in Niger) with 68 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.8%)\nhave been reported from twelve health districts in four regions: Dosso,\nMaradi, Tahoua, and Zinder. Four affected districts (Aguié, Guidam Roumji,\nMadarounfa, and Maradi commune) in Maradi Region and two affected districts\n(Birni Koni, and Mabalza) in Tahoua Region are on the border with Nigeria,\nwhile Gaya District in Dosso Region is close to the border with both Benin and\nNigeria. Overall, 34 cases from four regions have been confirmed for Vibrio\ncholerae O1 Inaba at the Centre for Medical and Health Research (CERMES) in\nNiamey: Dosso Region (1), Zinder Region (3), Maradi Region (10) and Tahoua\nregion (20).\n\nPoor sanitary conditions in the affected areas have been implicated in the\nspread of the outbreak. Frequent population movement between Niger and\nneighbouring Katsina State in Nigeria, which is also experiencing an upsurge\nin cases of cholera, is likely impacting on the outbreak.\n\n### Public health response\n\nThe following public health response sections have been implemented:\n\n    * Multisectoral cholera outbreak coordination structures have been set up at the district, regional and national levels. A regular National Epidemic Management Committee (NEMC) meeting is being held under the leadership of the Ministry of Health (MoH).In addition, WHO is finalizing the WHO action plan to support the MoH.\n    * WHO is supporting the deployment of eight epidemiologists to the Maradi and Tahoua regions to support surveillance activities. \n    * Surveillance activities are being scaled up with support from WHO and other partners and the daily reporting and line listing of cases have been established.\n    * Cholera treatment centres have been put in place by the Ministry of Health with the support of Médecins Sans Frontières, and the Non-governmental Organization (NGO) ALIMA (partnered with the local NGO Bien Être de la Femme et l'Enfant au Niger (BEFEN)). In total, six treatment sites have been set up in the affected districts and initial medical supplies have been dispatched. Niger has laboratory capacity through the national laboratory (CERMES) which confirmed Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 Inaba.\n    * Social mobilization and risk communication activities are being scaled-up with support from UNICEF and Niger Red Cross, focusing on hygiene messages.\n    * Currently, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities are focusing on the distribution of aqua tabs.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThe current outbreak started in Madarounfa district in Maradi Region, one of\nthe known hotspots for cholera along the Niger – Nigeria border, and has since\nspread to three geographically dispersed regions, including some of the most\naffected districts during previous cholera outbreaks.

More than 40% of the total number of cases have occurred within the past 21 days. However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities.\n  * The overall case fatality rate is 52%. It ranges from 42% in Sierra Leone to 66% in Guinea.\n  * A separate outbreak of Ebola virus disease, which is not related to the outbreak in West Africa, was laboratory-confirmed on 26 August by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is detailed in a separate edition of the Disease Outbreak News.\n\n### Health sector response\n\nA full understanding of the outbreak that will lead to improved response\nrequires detailed analysis of exactly where transmission is occurring (by\ndistrict level) and of time trends. This analysis is ongoing. Preliminary\nresults show that cases are still concentrated (62% of all reported cases\nsince the beginning of the outbreak) in the epicentre of the outbreak in\nGueckedou (Guinea); Lofa (Liberia), where cases continue to rise; and Kenema\nand Kailahun (Sierra Leone). Capital cities are of particular concern, owing\nto their population density and repercussions for travel and trade.\n\nWHO and its partners are on the ground establishing Ebola treatment centres\nand strengthening capacity for laboratory testing, contact tracing, social\nmobilization, safe burials, and non-Ebola health care.\n\nWHO continues to monitor for reports of rumoured or suspected cases from\ncountries around the world and systematic verification of these cases is\nongoing.

However,\nthere was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163\ncases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions.\nAn unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR\nin 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has\nbeen eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries\nsuch as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently\nnine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong\nSAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and\nSingapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles\nElimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more\nthan 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island\nCountries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made\npositive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination\ncoverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and\nmovement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable\nto outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine\n(MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.\n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly\navailable or information shared by Member States with WPR\n\n### Regional update\n\n#### Australia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported\nnationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of\ncases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of\ncases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or\noutbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\n\n#### China\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the\npredominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number\nof cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the\npopulation size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons.\nIn January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles\ncases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here\nand here\n\n#### Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual\nreported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few\nyears. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is\n66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases,\n27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew\nmembers of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link\nidentified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8),\nMainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan\n(6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam\n(1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second\nvaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the\nexisting policy. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Macao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China.\nOf these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but\nepidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases\ninclude 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Japan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had\nachieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378\nmeasles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases\nrecorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were\namong persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13),\nMyanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New\nZealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1),\nThailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri\nLanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a\ntotal of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of\ncases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with\nno or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Malaysia\n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia\nincreased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an\nincrease of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to\nmeasles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among\nunimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases\n(76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for\nconfirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000\npopulation. For more information, please see here and here\n\n#### New Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three\nclusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39\ncases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three\nin Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in\nCanterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines.\nA typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018\nassociated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related\nto travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person\nwho made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have\noccurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018,\na total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles\nelimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for\nfirst and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016.\nFor more information, please see here\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In\nFebruary 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles\noutbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro\nManila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five\nregions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1\nJanuary to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381\ndeaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared\nto the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded\nthe highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%)\nfollowed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The\nmajority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and\nunder five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low\nimmunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below\n70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6\nmillion Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from\nmeasles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine\nimmunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root\ncause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Republic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported,\nincluding eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with\nrecent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16),\nPhilippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1),\nMadagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more\ninformation, please see here\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO is working with Member States and partners to:\n\n  * Detect measles cases early and prevent avoidable deaths through case management \n  * Investigate, guide response to, and mobilize funds for ongoing measles outbreaks\n  * Develop risk communication plans and mobilize communities\n  * Strengthen outbreak preparedness \n  * Strengthen overall immunization systems and improve routine vaccination coverage\n  * Plan and implement preventive supplemental immunization campaigns to increase population immunity \n  * Strengthen laboratory-supported measles surveillance\n  * Develop national action plans for measles elimination\n  * Monitor progress towards and verify achievement of measles elimination through the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination\n  * Produce Regional guidance for preparedness for and response to measles and rubella outbreaks.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of\nmorbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the\navailability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an\nincreasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks\nin countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the\nresurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization\ncoverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can\nspread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and\nlocal levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants\ntoo young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants\nand those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be\nprotected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates\n(> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care\nservices, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A\ndeficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease\nafter infection.\n\nGiven the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and\nresponse, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing\npossibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular\nmovement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or\nfrom measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles;\ncountries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and\nlocal level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.\n\nThe recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to\ngaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among\nsubpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and;\n4) vaccine hesitancy.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nMeasles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to\nonset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset\nan average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international\ntravel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case\npatients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the\nrash to 4 days after the rash erupts.\n\nWith ongoing measles outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the\nWPR urges Member States to refer to and implement the following published WHO\nguidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness\nand response to measles outbreaks, including detailed procedures for effective\nsurveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, which enable\nrapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:\n\nWPRO Measles Elimination Field Guide (2013)1 [pp. 25—33, 38—52]; and Regional\nStrategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western\nPacific (2018)2 [pp. 72—76]. In particular, all countries in the WPR -\nregardless of country context or whether they have achieved elimination of\nendemic measles transmission or are currently experiencing an ongoing outbreak\n- should urgently take the following actions:\n\n  * Intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever to ensure measles cases are rapidly detected, confirmed and linked to rapid public health action.\n    * Intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all acute rash and fever cases to the vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance system, regardless of clinical suspicion and to be particularly attentive to whether patients have travelled internationally or have been in contact with international travellers in the preceding 21 days.\n    * Ensure that protocols and procedures for reporting, sample collection, rapid laboratory testing for case confirmation and genotyping, and epidemiological linkage for case confirmation are updated and reinforced among stakeholders.\n    * Analyse and provide regular and timely feedback of surveillance data to healthcare facilities and subnational public health officials (e.g. updates on suspected case counts nationally and at the subnational level).\n  * Ensure contingency resources for human resources, available vaccine stock, and operational funds are inventoried, and accessible to support rapid outbreak investigation and response immunization if measles cases are detected\n  * Identify coordination and leadership structures, mechanisms for rapid response team activation and lines of communication between local level, sub national and national level. \n  * Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing “zero-dose” to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread.\n  * Update and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO’s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. \n\nWHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel\nrestrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide\nhow best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and\ncommunities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports,\nincluding on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful\nadjunct to raising measles awareness in the community. People planning\ninternational travel should ensure they have been vaccinated against measles\nbecause of the high risk of exposure to the measles virus from fellow\ntravellers and in many countries in the world where measles is currently\nspreading.\n\nThe current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to\nrenew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures\ndetailed in the “Measles Elimination Field Guide”1 and the “Regional Strategy\nand Plan of Action”2 to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the\nrisk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission.\n\n  * Measles vaccines: WHO position paper (April 2017)\n  * Measles Fact Sheet\n  * WPRO Measles-Rubella Bulletin 2019\n\n* * *\n\n1Measles Elimination Field Guide (WPR, 2013)\n\n2Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in\nthe Western Pacific (WPR, 2018)\n\n3The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (EURO, 2013)\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\nRead more about\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",20073,"('\n\nGlobally, between 2016 and 2017, the number of reported measles cases\nincreased by 31%, while in the WHO Western Pacific Region (WPR), the total\nnumber of cases reported decreased by 82% during the same period. However,\nthere was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163\ncases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions.\nAn unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR\nin 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has\nbeen eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries\nsuch as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently\nnine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong\nSAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and\nSingapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles\nElimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more\nthan 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island\nCountries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made\npositive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination\ncoverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and\nmovement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable\nto outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine\n(MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.\n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly\navailable or information shared by Member States with WPR\n\n### Regional update\n\n#### Australia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported\nnationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of\ncases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of\ncases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or\noutbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\n\n#### China\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the\npredominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number\nof cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the\npopulation size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons.\nIn January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles\ncases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here\nand here\n\n#### Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual\nreported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few\nyears. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is\n66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases,\n27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew\nmembers of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link\nidentified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8),\nMainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan\n(6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam\n(1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second\nvaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the\nexisting policy. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Macao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China.\nOf these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but\nepidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases\ninclude 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Japan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had\nachieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378\nmeasles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases\nrecorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were\namong persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13),\nMyanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New\nZealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1),\nThailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri\nLanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a\ntotal of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of\ncases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with\nno or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Malaysia\n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia\nincreased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an\nincrease of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to\nmeasles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among\nunimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases\n(76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for\nconfirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000\npopulation. For more information, please see here and here\n\n#### New Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three\nclusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39\ncases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three\nin Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in\nCanterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines.\nA typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018\nassociated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related\nto travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person\nwho made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have\noccurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018,\na total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles\nelimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for\nfirst and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016.\nFor more information, please see here\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In\nFebruary 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles\noutbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro\nManila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five\nregions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1\nJanuary to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381\ndeaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared\nto the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded\nthe highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%)\nfollowed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The\nmajority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and\nunder five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low\nimmunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below\n70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6\nmillion Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from\nmeasles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine\nimmunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root\ncause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\n\n#### Republic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported,\nincluding eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with\nrecent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16),\nPhilippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1),\nMadagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more\ninformation, please see here\n\n### Public health response\n\nWHO is working with Member States and partners to:\n\n  * Detect measles cases early and prevent avoidable deaths through case management \n  * Investigate, guide response to, and mobilize funds for ongoing measles outbreaks\n  * Develop risk communication plans and mobilize communities\n  * Strengthen outbreak preparedness \n  * Strengthen overall immunization systems and improve routine vaccination coverage\n  * Plan and implement preventive supplemental immunization campaigns to increase population immunity \n  * Strengthen laboratory-supported measles surveillance\n  * Develop national action plans for measles elimination\n  * Monitor progress towards and verify achievement of measles elimination through the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination\n  * Produce Regional guidance for preparedness for and response to measles and rubella outbreaks.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of\nmorbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the\navailability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an\nincreasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks\nin countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the\nresurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization\ncoverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can\nspread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and\nlocal levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants\ntoo young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants\nand those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be\nprotected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates\n(> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care\nservices, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A\ndeficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease\nafter infection.\n\nGiven the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and\nresponse, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing\npossibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular\nmovement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or\nfrom measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles;\ncountries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and\nlocal level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.\n\nThe recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to\ngaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among\nsubpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and;\n4) vaccine hesitancy.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nMeasles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to\nonset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset\nan average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international\ntravel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic.

This resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO regions, with an unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas in WPR in 2019. Nine countries and areas in WPR have achieved measles elimination, but several countries and areas have reported outbreaks due to low immunization coverage and vaccine hesitancy. The WHO Regional Office for WPR is urging Member States to intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever, intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all cases, and ensure contingency resources are available for outbreak investigation and response immunization.

To correct this misunderstanding, WHO\ncalled a press conference at the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva on 14 August.\nDr Isabelle Nuttall, speaking on behalf of WHO, said, “Air travel, even from\nEbola-affected countries, is low-risk for Ebola transmission.”\n\nDr Nuttall further clarified modes of transmission for Ebola and emphasized\nthat the disease is not an airborne virus, unlike influenza or tuberculosis.\nThe infection is transmitted to others through direct contact with the bodily\nfluids of a sick person, such as blood, vomit, sweat, and diarrhoea.

Of these cases, 173 have died. Kuanza Sul has reported its first case,\nbringing the number of affected provinces to six, all concentrated in the\nnorth-western part of the country.\n\nInternational diagnostic and laboratory support\n\nFor laboratory work, Marburg virus has been classified as an extremely\nhazardous pathogen and can be handled safely only in specialized high-\ncontainment laboratories. WHO has established an international network of\nexpert laboratories for the diagnosis of Marburg and other viral haemorrhagic\nfevers. Within this network, laboratories in Canada, Germany, South Africa,\nand the USA are providing diagnostic support for the Angolan outbreak. All\nhave experience in working with Marburg virus.\n\nScientists from these laboratories are sharing test results and information on\nlaboratory techniques in a virtual network and during weekly teleconferences.\nTo ensure accurate tracking of the outbreak, members of the network are also\nstandardizing methods for sample collection, testing, and the interpretation\nof results. The various diagnostic tests for Marburg haemorrhagic fever\nrequire skilled technical interpretation, as findings can vary according to\nthe phase of the patient’s illness, the way in which samples were taken, and\nthe type of test used.\n\nIn Angola, a portable field laboratory is now operating in Uige and a second\none should be operational in Luanda shortly. Field laboratories provide rapid\nand sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions\nabout appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly.\nThe laboratory network is providing backup support for situations in which\nexceptionally precise diagnostic results are important because of the\nimplications for control measures. Such situations include the possible\nexportation of a case to another country, and a suspected case in a person who\nmay have placed numerous other people at unusually high risk.\n\nSophisticated laboratory studies of the virus may help shed some light on\ncertain unusual features of the outbreak, including the high fatality rate and\nthe overwhelming concentration of initial cases in children under the age of\nfive years.

Protection of workers involved in culling operations As more countries announce plans for the mass slaughter of poultry, WHO continues to stress the need for personal protection of these workers. Targeted administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to high-risk groups, such as cullers and poultry workers, is being recommended as one of several measures that reduce opportunities for the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype with pandemic potential. Guidelines for the use of seasonal influenza vaccine in humans at risk of H5N1 infection have been issued today. ',)",2635,2004_01_30-en,268,640

This is the fourth time that an Ebola outbreak has been reported in the former province of Equateur, following those of 1976, 1977 and 2014. However, this is the first time that the Bikoro health zone is facing an Ebola outbreak. The province of Equateur has an estimated population of 2.5 million people with 284 registered health facilities. Bikoro health zone has a population of around 163 000 people with three hospitals and 19 health centres covering the population, most with limited functionality. Medical supplies are provided by international bodies, but stock outs are frequent. ### Public health response * The Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo deployed Rapid Response Teams to investigate cases and deaths reported in Bikoro health zone in the Equateur province. * One million US dollars from the WHO contingency fund for emergencies have been mobilized. * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and Partners in the activation of multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response at all levels. * Médecins Sans Frontières is setting up a treatment centre for the management of cases in Bikoro health zone. * WHO has shared risk communication materials in French and Lingala with the WHO country offices. * Active surveillance activities among the community, the Ikoko-Impenge health centre team and Bikoro General Reference Hospital are being undertaken. * Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established. * Wellcome Trust is providing two million pounds sterling for the critical research needed to support the operational response which is now underway in the country. ### WHO risk assessment To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote area and appears to be geographically limited. However, in view of the available data, the overall risk is considered high at the national level due to the nature of the disease and the lack of epidemiological and demographic information to estimate the magnitude of the epidemic. The overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the proximity to the Congo river, which links with both the capitals of the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Information is currently limited and investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak. Based on the information currently available and the rapid response measures implemented by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and partners, the event does not meet the criteria of a public heath emergency of international concern as defined in the IHR (2005)1, and does not warrant the convening of an Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005). ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions of the international traffic in place.

In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next year, the Ministry of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries of Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive, that the vaccination against meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y and W135) has been added to the health requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj. WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely monitor meningococcal disease. For further information, see the Control of Epidemic Meningococcal Disease. WHO Practical Guidelines. 2nd edition (in English and in French, with annexes) In order to fully identify and follow the epidemiological spread of the W135 strain, WHO encourages countries to send specimens to WHO Collaborating Centres for Meningococcal Infections.

Tests conducted in two\nsamples from this single patient have identified the virus as the strain of\ninfluenza A(H5N1). A similar virus caused an outbreak in Hong Kong SAR in\n1997, with 18 cases detected and six deaths.\n\nIn the current outbreak, a 9-year-old boy who travelled to Fujian Province\n(China) in January with his mother and his two sisters became ill on February\n9 and was admitted to a Hong Kong hospital on February 12. He has recovered\nand is in a stable condition. Other members of his family presented with a\nsimilar illness. The child’s sister and father have died. The boy’s mother was\nill but has recovered.\n\nIt is not yet known whether the other family members were also infected with\ninfluenza A(H5N1).

In total, at the end of epidemiological week 2, 2017,\na total of 126 HEV RDT have been performed, of them 57 (45.2%) were positive,\nwhile 69 (54.8%) tested negative for Hepatitis E. 18 (31.6%) of the 57\npatients that tested positive using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria\ntest, and 20 (29%) out of 69 patients that tested negative using the HEV RDT\nalso had a positive malaria test.

The infectious risk seems confined to Am Timan and\nimmediate surroundings. However, the event remains under close monitoring at\nall levels of WHO. The current level of risk for further spread remains as\nmoderate to high and at local level, and the limited capacity to respond to\ndate calls for additional immediate support, especially in terms of water and\nsanitation and social mobilisation.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nWHO recommends the continuation of the investigations with a specific case\ndefinition as to describe the time, place and person characteristics of the\noutbreak and identify the source. It is important to identify the source of\ncontamination of the surface water and, in the meantime, to ensure water\nsafety by chlorination at the point of use by the population.

A suspect case is CRPA\nunavailable for mechanism testing or pending mechanism testing from a patient\nwho had an invasive procedure in Mexico in the month prior to collection of\nthe specimen.\n\nOf the 20 total cases, two were reported retrospectively and had dates of\nspecimen collection in 2015 and 2017, while the remaining 18 cases had dates\nof specimen collection between 5 September 2018 and 24 January 2019. All cases\nwere in travelers who received medical care from healthcare facilities in\nTijuana, Mexico.

On 1 August 2018, the Institut\nNational de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa reported that four of six\nsamples collected from hospitalised patients tested positive by GeneXpert\nautomated PCR. These presumptive positive tests prompted an immediate\nescalation of response activities by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners,\nand the declaration of the outbreak by the Minister of Health.\n\nThe prompt alert by the Ministry of Health to WHO, under the International\nHealth Regulations, followed the detection and rapid investigation of a\ncluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in a family in North Kivu\nProvince during mid to late July 2018. Local health officials have since\nidentified sporadic, antecedent deaths in the community since May 2018\n(tentatively classified as probable cases), which are subject to ongoing\ninvestigations to determine if they are related to the current outbreak.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are working to establish the full\nextent of this outbreak. As of 3 August 2018, a total of 43 Ebola virus\ndisease cases (13 confirmed and 30 probable), including 33 deaths, have been\nreported. An additional 33 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory\ntesting to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. Three healthcare workers\nhave been affected, of whom one has died.\n\nGeographically, confirmed and probable cases are currently localised to five\nhealth zones in North Kivu Province (38 cases, including 13 confirmed and 25\nprobable), and one health zone in Ituri Province (5 probable cases) (Figure\n1). Suspected cases are currently under investigation in one additional health\nzone of Ituri Province. The affected areas host over one million displaced\npeople and shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda, with frequent cross border\nmovement due to trade activities. The prolonged humanitarian crisis and\ndeterioration of the security situation is expected to hinder response to this\noutbreak.\n\nFurther laboratory testing by INRB has detected Ebolavirus using conventional\nPCR in three of the initial batch of six samples from Mabalako Health Zone.\nThese results are highly suggestive that Ebola Zaire species is the cause of\nthis outbreak; however, genetic sequencing is necessary to definitively\nconfirm the virus species.\n\nCharacterization of viral sequences will help to inform the potential use of\nvaccines and therapeutics, and any link to the recent outbreak in Équateur\nProvince – located in the far west of the country, some 2 500 km from the\ncurrent outbreak. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that these events\nare related.\n\nFigure 1: Ebola virus disease by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri Provinces,\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, 3 August 2018\n\n### Public health response\n\nThe Ministry of Health has initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and\nIturi provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the\nestablishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory\ncapacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management,\ncommunity engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination,\ncross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring\nprovinces and countries. In addition, the potential for use of Ebola vaccines,\nas well as therapeutics for treatment of Ebola virus disease, are being\nreviewed.\n\n  * The Ministry of Health and WHO have deployed Rapid Response Teams to the affected health zones to initiate response activities.\n  * WHO has activated country, regional and global coordination mechanisms to assess risks and respond accordingly to the event. An incident management team has been established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and support teams have been reactivated at the WHO Regional Office for Africa and at headquarters. Coordination meetings with Ministry of Health and partners were held on 1 August 2018 for deployment of human resources and material. Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established, and a full response plan is being developed.\n  * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and partners in the activation of a multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response.\n  * With support of international partners, Ebola treatment centres are being established in Mangina, Beni and Goma. \n  * A mobile laboratory has been established in Beni to facilitate timely diagnoses of suspected cases. The establishment of additional laboratory capacities elsewhere is being explored. \n  * Contact tracing activities have been initiated. Thus far, 879 contacts have been registered for follow-up. \n  * The Regional Emergency Director for Africa has informed neighbouring countries (Rwanda and Uganda) of the outbreak and emphasized the importance of surveillance and preparedness actions, especially along the border.\n  * Activities to sensitize communities to the outbreak, and hygiene and sanitation measures, through media and churches have begun in affected communities, and in neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda. \n  * On 1 August, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Operational Support Team has issued an alert to its network partners, providing an overview of the current situation and ongoing response activities. On 2 August, the GOARN Steering Committee and WHO Regional Office for Africa conducted a joint coordination call for operational partners in Africa. GOARN partners continue to contribute to response activities.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThis new outbreak of Ebola virus disease is affecting north eastern provinces\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda. Potential risk\nfactors for transmission of EVD at national and regional levels include the\ntransportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and\nneighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and\ndisplacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is\nconcurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian\ncrisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the\nimplementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public\nhealth risk is considered high at the national and regional levels and low\nglobally.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nAs investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak, it\nis important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance\nand preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring\ncountries to ensure health authorities are alerted and prepared to respond.\n\nWHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO\ncontinues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.\n\nFor further information on Ebola virus disease, including risk reduction\nmeasures to prevent transmission of the virus, see:\n\n  * Ebola virus disease fact sheet\n\nSee all DONs related to this event\n\n  * Regions\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Contact us\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nPrivacy Legal Notice\n\n©  2023\n\nWHO\n\n"",)",11417,"('\n\nOn 28 July 2018, the North Kivu Provincial Health Division notified the\nMinistry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a cluster of\nsuspected acute haemorrhagic fever cases.

Suspected cases are currently under investigation in one additional health\nzone of Ituri Province.

The establishment of additional laboratory capacities elsewhere is being explored. \n  * Contact tracing activities have been initiated. Thus far, 879 contacts have been registered for follow-up. \n  * The Regional Emergency Director for Africa has informed neighbouring countries (Rwanda and Uganda) of the outbreak and emphasized the importance of surveillance and preparedness actions, especially along the border.\n  * Activities to sensitize communities to the outbreak, and hygiene and sanitation measures, through media and churches have begun in affected communities, and in neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda. \n  * On 1 August, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Operational Support Team has issued an alert to its network partners, providing an overview of the current situation and ongoing response activities. On 2 August, the GOARN Steering Committee and WHO Regional Office for Africa conducted a joint coordination call for operational partners in Africa. GOARN partners continue to contribute to response activities.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThis new outbreak of Ebola virus disease is affecting north eastern provinces\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda. Potential risk\nfactors for transmission of EVD at national and regional levels include the\ntransportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and\nneighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and\ndisplacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is\nconcurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian\ncrisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the\nimplementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public\nhealth risk is considered high at the national and regional levels and low\nglobally.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nAs investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak, it\nis important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance\nand preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring\ncountries to ensure health authorities are alerted and prepared to respond.\n\nWHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO\ncontinues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.\n\nFor further information on Ebola virus disease, including risk reduction\nmeasures to prevent transmission of the virus, see:\n\n',)",7273,"(' On 28 July 2018, the North Kivu Provincial Health Division notified the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a cluster of suspected acute haemorrhagic fever cases. On 1 August 2018, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa reported that four of six samples collected from hospitalised patients tested positive by GeneXpert automated PCR. These presumptive positive tests prompted an immediate escalation of response activities by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, and the declaration of the outbreak by the Minister of Health. The prompt alert by the Ministry of Health to WHO, under the International Health Regulations, followed the detection and rapid investigation of a cluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in a family in North Kivu Province during mid to late July 2018. Local health officials have since identified sporadic, antecedent deaths in the community since May 2018 (tentatively classified as probable cases), which are subject to ongoing investigations to determine if they are related to the current outbreak. The Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are working to establish the full extent of this outbreak. As of 3 August 2018, a total of 43 Ebola virus disease cases (13 confirmed and 30 probable), including 33 deaths, have been reported. An additional 33 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. Three healthcare workers have been affected, of whom one has died. Geographically, confirmed and probable cases are currently localised to five health zones in North Kivu Province (38 cases, including 13 confirmed and 25 probable), and one health zone in Ituri Province (5 probable cases) (Figure 1). Suspected cases are currently under investigation in one additional health zone of Ituri Province. The affected areas host over one million displaced people and shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda, with frequent cross border movement due to trade activities. The prolonged humanitarian crisis and deterioration of the security situation is expected to hinder response to this outbreak. Further laboratory testing by INRB has detected Ebolavirus using conventional PCR in three of the initial batch of six samples from Mabalako Health Zone. These results are highly suggestive that Ebola Zaire species is the cause of this outbreak; however, genetic sequencing is necessary to definitively confirm the virus species. Characterization of viral sequences will help to inform the potential use of vaccines and therapeutics, and any link to the recent outbreak in Équateur Province – located in the far west of the country, some 2 500 km from the current outbreak. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that these events are related.

No cases\nhave been reported among the refugees from the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo who passed through the area during that period. The cause of the\noutbreak was probably the early onset of the dry season and consequent\ndrinking of water from the lake, as well as lack of prevention measures by the\npopulation. Action was taken to provide ORS and medicaments as well as clean\nwater by truck. Epidemiological surveillance was also strengthened. A\ncommittee met to mobilise the resources and to coordinate the measures of the\naid agencies.\n\nA cumulative total of 587 cases had previously been reported in Burundi since\nthe beginning of the year.\xa0\n\nMadagascar.

WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely monitor meningococcal disease. In order to fully identify and follow the epidemiological spread of the W135 strain, WHO encourages countries to send specimens to WHO Collaborating Centres for Meningococcal Infections.
