1299,"(' On 3 January 2019, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Jamaica notified WHO of an increase in dengue cases in Jamaica. From 1 January though 21 January 2019, 339 suspected and confirmed cases including six deaths were reported (Figure 1). In 2018, a total of 986 suspected and confirmed cases of dengue including 13 deaths have been reported. The number of reported dengue cases in 2018 was 4.5 times higher than that reported in 2017 (215 cases including six deaths). Cases reported to date for 2019 exceed the epidemic threshold (Figure 2). According to historic data, Jamaica reported a major outbreak in 2016, when 2297 cases of dengue infection including two deaths were reported. Dengue virus 3 (DENV3) and DENV4 circulations were confirmed at the time. By the end of 2018, the largest number of reported cases were notified by Kingston and Saint Andrew parishes. In 2019 so far, the largest proportion of cases have been reported by Saint Catherine parish. Laboratory tests have identified DENV3 as the dengue serotype currently circulating. In January 2019, some countries and territories in the Caribbean region, such as Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint Martin, reported an increase in dengue cases. Of note, in Saint Martin and Guadeloupe, serotype DENV1 is currently circulating. #### Figure 1.

Suspected, presumed and confirmed dengue cases by month for 2018 and 2019 versus monthly averages and epidemic threshold for Jamaica Source: Jamaica Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO ### Public health response * The Ministry of Health (MoH) declared the dengue outbreak on 3 January 2019. * Health authorities in Jamaica are implementing measures for the following activities; strengthened integrated vector control, enhanced surveillance of cases, social mobilization, clinical management, enhanced laboratory diagnostic capacity, and emergency risk communications. * The MoH has been collaborating with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and other international agencies to strengthen and co-ordinate the response activities. * Since July 2018, the MoH has intensified its vector control activities. * The MoH launched the Emergency Operations Centre on 27 December 2018; and fully activated it on 3 January 2019 to facilitate the coordination and reporting of activities. The response activities are geared towards strengthening the response capacity with adequate human resources, as well as supporting efforts to reduce the entomological indices for the Aedes aegypti mosquito across the island and enhancing clinical management capacity. ### WHO risk assessment Jamaica has been reporting dengue cases since 1990 and throughout 2018; however, an increase has been observed since December 2018 exceeding the epidemic threshold. Similar large increases were reported in 2010 (2887 cases), 2012 (4670 cases), and 2016 (2297 cases). The increase of dengue in the Caribbean islands may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and require comprehensive risk communication. ### WHO advice On 21 November 2018, PAHO/WHO alerted Member States about an increase in dengue cases in countries and territories in the Americas and recommended coordinated actions both inside and outside of the health sector, including prioritizing activities to prevent transmission of dengue as well as deaths due to this disease. PAHO/WHO further advises to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue, available at the link below. There is no specific treatment for disease due to dengue; therefore, prevention is the most important step to reduce the risk of dengue infection. WHO recommends proper and timely case management of dengue cases. Surveillance should continue to be strengthened within all affected areas and at the national level. Key public health communication messages should continue to be provided to reduce the risk of transmission of dengue in the population. In addition, integrated vector management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposures. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. Where indoor biting occurs, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce biting activity. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce biting. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, personal protective measures such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight hours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing. The use of repellents must be in strict accordance with label instructions. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection for those who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, the bedridden, and night-shift workers) as well as during the night to prevent mosquito bites. WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied based on the information available for this event. ',)"

To date, 169 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 112 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 69 deaths. In addition, 41 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 55 cases (33 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-five (25) health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12 confirmed). Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (53 cases, including 23 deaths), Guekedou (122/87), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (60/38), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). These updated figures include 3 new cases isolated on 20 April from Conakry and Guekedou, 2 of whom are laboratory confirmed. Five new deaths have also been reported among existing cases; all 5 of the deaths were patients with confirmed EVD. Twenty-one (21) patients were in isolation in Conakry (12), Guekedou (8) and Macenta (1), while 16 patients who recovered from their illness were discharged from hospital. Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. A total of 217 contacts are currently under medical observation and 92 have completed their 21 days of follow-up. The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries. ### Liberia From 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 21 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has reported a total of 34 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, 2 probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April and the date of admission of the last confirmed case was 10 April. The confirmed and probable cases were reported from Lofa and Margibi Counties, while suspected cases have been reported from Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado and Nimba Counties as a result of enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities. The number of confirmed cases in HCWs has been adjusted down from 3 cases to two as data are reviewed against case definitions and laboratory results. The total number of deaths has also been revised from 13 to 11 as one of the deaths has been counted in the EVD statistics for Guinea and one death occurred in a discarded case. As laboratory tests have been conducted on 32 clinical samples overall only 6 of which have tested positive for ebolavirus to date, it is anticipated that most of the suspected cases currently reported by Liberia will be reclassified as discarded and removed from the case count in the future. Following data review, the number of contacts now stands at 162 in total; Foya district, Lofa County, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia accounts for 72% (116) of the total contacts followed by Margibi County (17%, 28 contacts). Fifty-nine contacts (36% of the total) have completed 21 days follow up and have been discharged from medical observation. ### Sierra Leone As of 22 April 2014, clinical samples from 19 clinically compatible cases of EVD have been tested at the Kenema Government Hospital. All 19 samples tested negative for ebolavirus. As part of enhanced surveillance activities, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone also decided to test for the presence of ebolavirus in samples from patients referred to the Lassa Fever Isolation Ward of the Kenema Hospital for the investigation of viral hemorrhagic fever-like illness who tested negative for Lassa fever virus infection. The additional 24 blood samples collected from 16 March 2014 onwards were analysed and all tested negative for ebolavirus. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event. ',)"
1030,"(' 3 June 2013 - In Israel, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was isolated from sewage samples collected on 9 April 2013 in Rahat, southern Israel. The virus has been detected in sewage only; no case of paralytic polio has been reported. Genetic sequencing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine its origin. Preliminary analyses indicate the strain is not related to the virus currently affecting the Horn of Africa. The virus isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance in Israel that involves regular testing of sewage water. Israel has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1988. In the past, wild poliovirus has been detected in environmental samples collected in this region between 1991 and 2002 without occurrence of cases of paralytic polio in the area. Following detection of the wild poliovirus, health authorities in Israel are conducting a full epidemiological and public health investigation, actively searching for potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un- immunized persons. Routine immunization levels are estimated at 94 percent. Outcomes of the investigation will determine the need for any additional catch-up immunization activities, as necessary. Similar activities are being implemented by health authorities in Gaza and the West Bank. Specimens collected through environmental surveillance since 2002 in both Gaza and the West Bank have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV. Given that there are high levels of population immunity levels in the area, and the investigations and response being implemented, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus strain from Israel as low to moderate. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 percent. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Three countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of WPV: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Additionally, in 2013, the Horn of Africa is affected by an outbreak of WPV, with six cases confirmed in Kenya and Somalia. ',)"

Ebola virus (sub-type Sudan) has been confirmed by laboratory tests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States and the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Nairobi, Kenya. The team from the WHO South Sudan Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN) and from WHO headquarters are continuing to work with the Crisis Committee to control the outbreak. Médecins sans Frontières (MSF-France) is supporting the isolation ward and case management in Yambio hospital. CDC, as part of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are providing further laboratory and infection control experts in the field. Other nongovernmental organizations and churches are also working to contain the outbreak. National authorities in the neighbouring countries of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and in Uganda have enhanced surveillance in bordering areas (see map below). In DRC, a national team, supported by the WHO Country Office is alerting the local population, augmenting surveillance and performing active case finding.

1382,"(' 21 November 2003 Since the beginning of October, outbreaks of influenza in a number of countries in Europe and North America have been due largely to A(H3N2) viruses; whereas, A(H1) viruses were responsible for outbreaks in Iceland. Influenza activity has continued to increase during November in Canada, Finland, France, Israel, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). In Europe (Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), most H3N2 viruses that have been characterized antigenically so far this season were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; in the UK, 2/3 of isolates characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and one third were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In Canada, more than a half of the A(H3N2) isolates characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, while the rest were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the US, more than ¾ of the A(H3N2) isolates were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the last eight weeks, five deaths in children, two in England and three in Scotland, have been confirmed as due to A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus. A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains are drift variants of the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine virus. Therefore antibodies produced against the A/Panama/2007/99-like strain(see WER 2003 78(9): 58-62 and WER 2003 87(11):77 ) do cross-react with A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, but at a lower level. For example, in laboratory tests of sera from recipients of influenza vaccines currently used in the northern hemisphere, there were on average 41% reductions in the post-immunization antibody titres to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, when compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain. However despite such reductions, the tests demonstrated that 76% of adult and 72% of the elderly vaccinees possessed protective levels of antibody(HI titres of >40) to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains.

1435,"("" 21 April 2011 - Côte d'Ivoire is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) with three new cases reported with onset of paralysis on 27 January, 24 February and 27 February this year. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses show that they are linked to WPV3 last detected in mid-2008 in northern Nigeria. They are the first WPV3 recorded in Côte d'Ivoire since 2000. In 2008-2009, Côte d'Ivoire was affected by a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting west Africa (and which was recently stopped). There is currently a high risk of further spread of WPV3 - both within and from - Côte d'Ivoire. It is the first time since 2000 that WPV3 has been recorded in this part of west Africa (WPV3 transmission has been limited to northern Nigeria and parts of Niger, and since 2008 also in parts of Mali and one case in Benin). The outbreak response may be constrained by the current security situation in Côte d'Ivoire. Due to the persistence of subnational surveillance gaps in Côte d'Ivoire and other areas of west Africa, undetected further circulation cannot be ruled out at this time. Detection of these WPV3 cases underscores the risk suboptimal surveillance poses to the global polio eradication effort. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at its lowest level in history, with only nine cases reported worldwide in 2011 - efforts to rapidly interrupt all remaining chains of WPV3 transmission is a key priority for the global polio eradication effort. The overriding priority is to urgently stop the WPV3 outbreak, while maintaining high population immunity across west Africa to WPV1. Two rounds of coordinated, multi-country supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) across west Africa have been/are being implemented on 25 March 2011, and again on 29 April 2011, in 15 countries across west Africa (except Côte d'Ivoire, see next paragraph). A further outbreak response is currently planned in six countries, over and beyond these two multi-country SIAs. Such a further response could see planned SIAs scheduled for the fourth quarter to be brought forward to earlier in the year. In Côte d'Ivoire, the end-March SIA did not take place due to the current security and political situation. A response round is proposed in the affected province using bOPV in late April 2011, to be followed by two National Immunization Days (NIDs), as soon as the situation permits. Planning is underway to ensure capacity (ie technical, vaccine, operational) is in place for this emergency response. Coordination with other United Nations (UN) organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Côte d'Ivoire is ongoing, to ensure that OPV is added to any planned immunization activity, in particular for displaced populations. Ongoing transmission will be monitored, and mop-ups implemented as epidemiology dictates. An investigation is ongoing to more clearly identify surveillance gaps in the region, including among mobile, migrant and underserved populations. Measures will be implemented to strengthen sub-national surveillance, to ensure that all groups and areas, particularly high-risk populations, are covered by high- quality surveillance. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Côte d'Ivoire, and other polio-affected countries of west Africa, should be fully protected by vaccination. Travellers who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to should have a complete course of vaccination. Travellers from Côte d'Ivoire, and other polio-affected countries of west Africa, should have a full course of vaccination against polio before departure, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure. #### For more information "",)"

The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. ### WHO response WHO and partners are providing the necessary technical support to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. This includes a high-level advocacy meeting with the governments of the three affected countries to enhance coordination, information management, and communication, among others. The WHO Regional Director, in consultation with the Director General, has established a temporary function of WHO sub-regional EVD outbreak response Coordinator to directly support the affected countries. The Coordinator is based in Conakry, Guinea. In addition, WHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub-region, technical experts and key stakeholders to be held from 2–3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The objective is to ensure increased political commitment and enhanced cross- border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO, GOARN, and other partners are also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in deploying additional experts in the various specialities (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, data management, and logistics, among others) to support the EVD outbreak response efforts. The next cross-border technical meeting among the three countries is planned for 23 June 2014 in Kailahun, Sierra Leone. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. * * * CORRIGENDUM * In a Disease Outbreak News for Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa, dated 22 June 2014 (http://who.int/csr/don/2014_06_22_ebola/en/), WHO reported 58 deaths from EVD based on best available information from Sierra Leone. The cumulative suspected, probable, and confirmed (including 3 new confirmed Ebola deaths) was 55 not 58. The new confirmed deaths were double counted. On 24 June 2014, WHO reported 34 deaths from EVD based on best available information from Sierra Leone. (http://who.int/csr/don/2014_06_24_ebola/en/) This discrepancy in numbers is a result of a change in the reporting methodology on the part of Sierra Leone. The new method did not include probable or suspect deaths and were only deaths of laboratory-confirmed cases. The reported cases in Kono and Western Area were suspect cases which have now proved negative. As of 24 June, there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in Kono and Western Area.

1035,"(' 1 October 2013 - Three suspected cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from South Sudan are currently being investigated. All three patients are girls, two of whom are approximately two-years-old and one is eight-years-old. All had previously been immunized with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Two of the patients are from North Bahr El Gazal state (close to the border with Sudan), and one is from Eastern Equatoria state (close to the border with Kenya and Uganda). They developed paralysis between 15-24 August 2013. Genetic sequencing is ongoing to provide final confirmation of the laboratory results to determine the origin of the isolated viruses. The Horn of Africa is currently experiencing an outbreak of WPV1, with 174 cases in Somalia, 14 cases in Kenya and three cases in Ethiopia. Because of the routes of poliovirus spread in previous Horn of Africa outbreaks, South Sudan had been considered at high risk of re-infection. In 2013, South Sudan conducted two National Immunization Days (NIDs) in March 2013 and April 2013, with additional NIDs planned for November 2013 and December 2013. Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) were conducted in August 2013. Contingency plans for an emergency outbreak response are currently being finalized, including an immediate supplementary immunization activity (SIA) in and around the infected areas. An international team of experts is being deployed to South Sudan, to assist the local authorities in further case investigations, planning for appropriate outbreak response, and further intensifying active searches for additional potential cases. Immunization rates in neighbouring Sudan and Uganda are also being assessed to determine overall population immunity levels. As needed, additional SIAs will be conducted to help fill any identified immunity gaps. Uganda conducted SNIDs in July 2013 and September 2013, with further SNIDs planned for October 2013 and NIDs in December 2013. Sudan plans to conduct NIDs in November 2013 and December 2013. Outbreak response in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia is continuing. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with poliovirus-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Through its Regional Offices for Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, the World Health Organization (WHO) is continuing its support to countries in planning and implementing emergency outbreak response activities across the region. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. ',)"

As of 21 September, 7 166 cases had been reported throughout the country, among whom 133 people had died. The overall case-fatality rate stands at 1.9%, and decreases below 1% for hospitalized cases. However, the case-fatality rate reaches 9% in remote areas, indicating that rural populations affected by cholera do not have access to treatment rapidly enough to save lives. The fact that Bissau, the capital, accounts for more than 70% of all cases but only 31% of deaths also illustrates this issue. The areas with the highest attack rates are Bissau, Biombo, Bijagos and Oio. Cholera epidemics regularly resurge in Guinea-Bissau. In 2005-2006, cholera affected 25 111 people and killed 399. Numerous national and international partners are supporting the Ministry of Health. Médecins sans Frontières (MSF-Spain) took charge of cholera treatment centres by building local capacity, and improving early detection and treatment of cases through systematic patient home visits. UNICEF is providing technical expertise and material in the area of water and sanitation; WHO has deployed an epidemiologist. A team from The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), together with an expert team from Brazil, have also arrived in the country. In addition, efforts are being made to strengthen community mobilization, health and hygiene education, and to de-stigmatize cholera among potentially-affected populations. Cholera is mainly transmitted through contaminated water and food and is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. In many areas of Guinea-Bissau, basic infrastructures appear to be largely inefficient. The overall quality of water and sanitation remains very poor, therefore facilitating cholera transmission. Long-term prevention of cholera depends on access to safe water and adequate sanitation to prevent exposure and interrupt transmission. In addition, corpses of deceased cholera patients should be handled with extreme caution and correctly disinfected before proceeding with the burial ceremony to avoid further contamination. WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera. ### For more information ',)"

1129,"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance WHO continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The Ebola epidemic trend remains precarious, with community and health-facility transmissions of infection still taking place. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD cases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected chains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is retrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up outbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing. In addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable case of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old Liberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in hospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while traveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died on 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis was conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital and tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working closely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained at the source. ### Health sector response In an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community and development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies again pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are underway to secure additional human and financial resources. The Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his fact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia earlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and Guinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD outbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with Presidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials, international and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held. During the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the outbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection prevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each national health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected countries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and communities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re- deploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to the field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural practices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border collaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to coordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the Regional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries and reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community in support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak. On 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director officially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical support at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked its partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to sit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre. The establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency Ministerial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month. Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the response in the three countries, including contact tracking, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 108 new cases of EVD, including 12 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 25 new cases with 2 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 71 new cases and 5 death. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 23 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 201, including 672 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 427 cases (311 confirmed, 99 probable, and 17 suspected) and 319 deaths (208 confirmed, 99 probable, and 12 suspected); Liberia, 249 cases (84 confirmed, 84 probable, and 81 suspected) and 129 deaths (60 confirmed, 50 probable, and 19 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 525 cases (419 confirmed, 56 probable, and 50 suspected) and 224 deaths (188 confirmed, 33 probable, and 3 suspected). ### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 23 July 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country Guinea Cases 12 311 99 17 427 Deaths 5 208 99 12 319 Liberia Cases 25 84 84 81 249 Deaths 2 60 50 19 129 Sierra Leone Cases 71 419 56 50 525 Deaths 5 188 33 3 224 Totals Cases 108 814 239 148 1 201 Deaths 12 456 182 34 672 1\\.

1226,"(' In Pakistan, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected from environmental samples in Quetta, Balochistan. Two isolates with apparent genetic linkages were isolated from environmental samples, collected on 20 October and 28 November 2016. Virus was isolated from environmental samples only and no associated cases of paralysis linked to the isolated strains have been detected in Quetta or anywhere else in the province. Pakistan also continues to be affected by endemic transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). As of 21 December, 19 WPV1 cases have been reported in 2016. It is the lowest number of annual cases ever reported, from the fewest number of affected areas in the country. The majority of the polio cases during the last six months were reported from non-reservoir areas, i.e. from ‘tier 2, 3 and 4’ districts (districts which are considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection). There have been no paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in Pakistan since February 2016. ### Public health response A response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in the Quetta and neighbouring districts is now planned, in line with internationally-agreed protocols. The first campaign of a series of campaigns is planned for 2 January 2017. In addition, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoHSRC), supported by World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other partners, is further strengthening active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and conducting an in-depth field investigation to more clearly ascertain the circulation of this strain. Pakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, to urgently interrupt all remaining strains of polio transmission in the country. The area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational common reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting WPV1 transmission in this area remains the top most priority of the federal, provincial and district health teams. Meticulous preparations are underway through the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and District Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of upcoming back- to-back national and sub-national vaccination rounds, in December 2016, January 2017 and February 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). These campaigns are critical to addressing the remaining pockets of under-immunized populations sustaining low-intensity WPV1 transmission within the common reservoir. To ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate resources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified reasons for missed children; validating vaccination teams’ microplans, vaccinator selection, training and supervision; and enhancing local engagement with communities through community leaders. In order to jointly address transmission across the common reservoir, close coordination is ongoing with Afghanistan teams at all levels. ### WHO risk assessment WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common reservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical spread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with Afghanistan). WHO also assesses the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the common reservoir as medium to high. Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to other countries is assessed low. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission is subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure. ',)"

1123,"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance WHO continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The current epidemic trend of EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia remains serious, with 67 new cases and 19 deaths reported from 15 – 17 July 2014. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The EVD outbreak in Guinea continues to show a declining trend, with no new cases reported during this period. Critical analyses and review of the current outbreak response is being undertaken to inform the process of developing prioritized national operational plans. Effective implementation of the prioritized plans will be vital in reversing the current trend of EVD outbreak, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone. ### Health sector response WHO has been working with national authorities and partners in the affected countries to analyse and review the current outbreak response. An assessment of the outbreak response conducted in Liberia identified several gaps and challenges. Some of the gaps identified include low coverage of contact tracing; persisting denial and resistance in the community; weak data management; inadequate infection prevention and control practices, especially in peripheral health facilities; and weak leadership and coordination at sub- national levels. Underpinning these challenges were limited financial resources and human technical capacity. Comprehensive mapping of the financial, logistics, and human resource needs will be articulated in the national operational plan under development. This exercise of developing prioritized operational plans is also being conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Following the call for regional collaboration during the Accra Ministerial meeting, the Government and the Ministry of Health of Gambia provided a team of 11 health-care workers to support outbreak response in Sierra Leone. While this team will contribute the critical human resource needs, the mission will be crucial for enhancing capacity for epidemic preparedness and response in The Gambia. This mission is being supported by UNDP, Gambia, and WHO Sierra Leone. Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

A training workshop was conducted for all health care workers to enhance their capacity for the early detection and prompt management of cases. Surveillance is ongoing in the surrounding villages and districts for early detection of cases. Entomological surveillance revealed the presence of Aedes aegypti larvae and adult mosquito at the sites where cases are living; consequently, entomological control measures for dengue vector were immediately set up. So far, these measures have resulted in a dramatic decline in the density of adult mosquito (from 23% to 0%) and larvae (from 25% to 0.5%). Entomological surveillance and vector control measures continue to be implemented in the affected villages and its surrounding areas. ',)"
1079,"(' ### Guinea As of 18:00 on 10 May 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 233 clinical cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), including 157 deaths. Since the last update of 9 May 2014, there have been no new cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR and no new deaths bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 129, including 83 deaths. There have been no change in the number of probable cases or deaths (49 cases, 40 deaths) and suspected cases or deaths (55 cases, 34 deaths). The geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is as follows: Conakry (50 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (149/106), Macenta (23/17), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). There have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 April, Macenta since 9 April and Conakry since 26 April. In Djingaraye and Dabola, no new cases have been reported since the end of March 2014. The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (74/51); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The numbers of cases remain subject to change due to reclassification and consolidation of cases and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. Introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases. ### Liberia and Sierra Leone There have been no new alerts in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. Preparations to host cross- border meeting with Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone are underway. In Liberia, upon review and consolidation of data, the cumulative number of cases is 12 (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 4 suspected). There has been no change in number of deaths (11) and date of onset of the most recent confirmed or probable case (6 April 2014). ### WHO response WHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities. As of 7 May, 113 experts have been deployed to assist in the response. This includes 54 experts deployed through the global WHO surge mechanism, 33 international experts from among partner institutions of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), 10 externally recruited consultants, 16 WHO staff who were locally repurposed. Expertise has been mobilized in the areas of coordination, medical anthropology, clinical case management, data management and health informatics, surveillance and epidemiology, infection prevention and control, laboratory services, logistics, risk communications, social mobilization, finance and administration, and resource mobilization. To date, 88 experts have been deployed to Guinea, 21 to Liberia, one to Sierra Leone, and three to the WHO Regional Office for Africa. An additional, 11 deployments are in the pipeline in the disciplines of medical anthropology, clinical case management, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory services, logistics, and risk and media communications. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event. ',)"
1131,"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance WHO continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The Ebola epidemic trend remains precarious, with community and health-facility transmissions of infection still taking place. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD cases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected chains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is retrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up outbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing. In addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable case of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old Liberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in hospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while traveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died on 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis was conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital and tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working closely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained at the source. ### Health sector response In an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community and development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies again pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are underway to secure additional human and financial resources. The Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his fact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia earlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and Guinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD outbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with Presidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials, international and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held. During the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the outbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection prevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each national health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected countries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and communities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re- deploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to the field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural practices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border collaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to coordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the Regional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries and reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community in support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak. On 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director officially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical support at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked its partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to sit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre. The establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency Ministerial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month. Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the response in the three countries, including contact tracking, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 108 new cases of EVD, including 12 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 25 new cases with 2 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 71 new cases and 5 death. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 23 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 201, including 672 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 427 cases (311 confirmed, 99 probable, and 17 suspected) and 319 deaths (208 confirmed, 99 probable, and 12 suspected); Liberia, 249 cases (84 confirmed, 84 probable, and 81 suspected) and 129 deaths (60 confirmed, 50 probable, and 19 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 525 cases (419 confirmed, 56 probable, and 50 suspected) and 224 deaths (188 confirmed, 33 probable, and 3 suspected). ### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 23 July 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country Guinea Cases 12 311 99 17 427 Deaths 5 208 99 12 319 Liberia Cases 25 84 84 81 249 Deaths 2 60 50 19 129 Sierra Leone Cases 71 419 56 50 525 Deaths 5 188 33 3 224 Totals Cases 108 814 239 148 1 201 Deaths 12 456 182 34 672 1\\.

1164,"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 17 and 18 August 2014, a total of 221 new cases of Ebola virus disease (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 106 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. ### Health sector response WHO continues to engage in high-level communication efforts with affected countries, companies and organizations doing business in and from Africa, and national and global leaders. Currently, some companies have taken the decision to suspend services to the affected countries. This includes airlines and shipping companies. As a result of these decisions, countries are beginning to experience supply shortages, including fuel, food, and basic supplies. WHO is working with the UN World Food Programme to ensure adequate food and supplies, but calls on companies to make business decisions based on scientific evidence with regard to the transmission of Ebola virus. In the current outbreak, the majority of Ebola virus disease cases are a result of human-to-human transmission and failure to apply appropriate infection prevention and control measures in home care, some clinical settings, and in burial rituals. It is important to understand that EVD is not an airborne disease. Individuals may become infected as a result of contact with the bodily fluids (vomit, diarrhoea, sputum, blood, etc.) from persons who are confirmed to have EVD or who have died from EVD. Companies bringing goods and services to the affected countries are at low risk for exposure to EVD and WHO, under the International Health Regulations, encourages companies and organizations to continue providing these necessary supplies. Countries around the world continue to engage in active surveillance for cases of EVD. Reports have been received by WHO of suspected cases and systematic verification is underway in a number of countries to confirm whether these are actual EVD cases. Overall, these reports are a positive sign that surveillance is working and countries are stepping up their preparedness to respond. As of today, no cases have been confirmed outside Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone. A high-level delegation from WHO is currently in the affected countries, working with the national authorities and partners to adapt strategic operations response plans. Meetings are planned with leaders in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where transmission continues to be high. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.)

Systematic reporting of deaths from cholera has not been undertaken in health centres. WHO has put an emergency surveillance system in place to fill this gap. The first peak reached 935 cases during 7-13 July. The weekly average decreased by end July -early August, although the worsening security situation prevented cholera patients from attending health care facilities. Since the ceasefire and the improvement in security, the number of registered cases has been rapidly increasing. According to figures collected at cholera treatment centres in Monrovia, there were 727 registered cases during 4-10 August and 1203 cases during11-17 August. More people are now returning to their homes or to refugee camps outside Monrovia; as a result, the cholera outbreak is spreading from central Monrovia to peripheral areas of the city and neighbouring districts. There are approximately 230 000 people in internally displaced persons camps in Monrovia living in very difficult conditions. The sanitation is poor and safe water is scarce with only 2 litres per day per person available. In order to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and to limit cholera transmission, WHO, in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, has launched a campaign for the chlorination of water in Monrovia. The chlorination of 5000 open wells in the city has begun and the process will be repeated regularly until the cholera risk has diminished. Nutrition screening carried out by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) found that 40 % of the children screened are suffering from acute malnutrition which may increase the rate of severe cholera cases. Médecins sans Frontières France and Belgium and MERLIN have opened cholera treatment centres near the most affected areas. The Cholera Coordination Committee has been reactivated to ensure the effectiveness of the efforts of partners (Ministry of Health, WHO, NGOs) operating in Liberia during this post-war phase. In particular, NGOs have been encouraged to better inform the population on cholera preventive measures. "",)"

Three associated human cases have also been reported, all with a benign febrile illness. Towards the end of January, six pregnant buffalo were observed to abort, and, shortly after, 3 giraffes and 1 waterbuck were found dead without obvious signs of predator attack. Three veterinarians in contact with tissues from these animals developed an uncomplicated, febrile illness. Deaths among goat kids in adjacent areas have also been recorded. Virus has been detected in tissues from the buffalo fetuses, the waterbuck, a giraffe, and 1 veterinarian. A program of control measures has been instituted: local farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock, and public health information on appropriate precautions has been disseminated to those involved in the livestock industry. Mosquito control measures have been increased in tourist destinations. However, most human cases of RVF reported in the past from South Africa were acquired through contact with diseased animals and their tissues, rather than through mosquito bites, so the general public is not perceived to be at particular risk of contracting the illness. Large outbreaks of RVF occurred in South Africa's inland plateau in 1974-76, and a small outbreak was recorded in 1981 in a coastal area of KwaZulu-Natal, but no disease activity has been detected in the intervening period. Several consecutive years with high rainfall have favoured the explosion of the Aedes mosquito population which is the vector for the virus. "",)"

1264,"(' Circulation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Somalia. Three cVDPV2s strains were isolated from environmental samples collected on 4 and 11 January 2018, in Banadir province (Mogadishu). These latest isolates are genetically linked to cVDPV2 strains collected from environmental samples in the same province on 22 October and 2 November 2017. No associated cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been detected. ### Public health response Since detection of the initial isolates in 2017, two large-scale immunization campaigns (SIA) in line with internationally-agreed guidelines have been implemented, in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle provinces. A third SIA is planned for March 2018, and further response based on evolving epidemiology and ongoing risk assessment is being evaluated. Surveillance for AFP is being strengthened. WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2. ### WHO risk assessment The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. Such event also underscores the risk in areas or regions with continued substantial insecurity that hampers maintaining high population immunity through routine vaccination. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and prevention measures being implemented. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement prevention measures, and speed-up the response if needed. Countries should also maintain uniformly on all their territory high polio immunization coverage through routine vaccination to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction or emergence. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel. Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to International Health Regulations Temporary Recommendations that request them to report a case of polio as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travelers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travelers before departure. ',)"
893,"("" 24 April 2009 - The United States Government has reported seven confirmed human cases of Swine Influenza A/H1N1 in the USA (five in California and two in Texas) and nine suspect cases. All seven confirmed cases had mild Influenza-Like Illness (ILI), with only one requiring brief hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. The Government of Mexico has reported three separate events. In the Federal District of Mexico, surveillance began picking up cases of ILI starting 18 March. The number of cases has risen steadily through April and as of 23 April there are now more than 854 cases of pneumonia from the capital. Of those, 59 have died. In San Luis Potosi, in central Mexico, 24 cases of ILI, with three deaths, have been reported. And from Mexicali, near the border with the United States, four cases of ILI, with no deaths, have been reported. Of the Mexican cases, 18 have been laboratory confirmed in Canada as Swine Influenza A/H1N1, while 12 of those are genetically identical to the Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses from California. The majority of these cases have occurred in otherwise healthy young adults. Influenza normally affects the very young and the very old, but these age groups have not been heavily affected in Mexico. Because there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus, and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks, plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected, these events are of high concern. The Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses characterized in this outbreak have not been previously detected in pigs or humans. The viruses so far characterized have been sensitive to oseltamivir, but resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine. The World Health Organization has been in constant contact with the health authorities in the United States, Mexico and Canada in order to better understand the risk which these ILI events pose. WHO (and PAHO) is sending missions of experts to Mexico to work with health authorities there. It is helping its Member States to increase field epidemiology activities, laboratory diagnosis and clinical management. Moreover, WHO's partners in the Global Alert and Response Network have been alerted and are ready to assist as requested by the Member States. WHO acknowledges the United States and Mexico for their proactive reporting and their collaboration with WHO and will continue to work with Member States to further characterize the outbreak. "",)"
1370,"(' 27 February 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported As of 27 February no further cases of human influenza A(H5N1) have been reported in Hong Kong SAR (see previous report). To date the current outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR has been limited to two cases, one of whom has died. Both cases were members of the same family who returned to their home in Hong Kong SAR on 8 February after travelling to Fujian province, China. The mother and children were in mainland China for 14 days; the father for 9 days. The father of the family (a 33 year old man) developed respiratory symptoms on 7 February whilst in Fujian Province, China. He was admitted to hospital in Hong Kong SAR on 11 February with pneumonia but died on 17 February. Influenza A (H5N1) was isolated from post-mortum specimens on 20 February. The man´s 9 year old son also became unwell whilst in Fujian province. He was admitted to hospital in Hong Kong SAR on 12 February with pneumonia. Influenza A (H5N1) was isolated from two nasopharageal aspirates taken from the boy on 19 February. The boy is in a stable condition. Additional family members have also had respiratory symptoms. The boy’s 8 year old sister died on 4 February whilst the family was in Fujian Province, China. The cause of her death is under investigation. The mother has now recovered from what was thought to have been a parainfluenza infection. An outbreak of atypical pneumonia occurred between November 2002 and February 2003 in Guandong province, China. Health authorities in China investigated the outbreak and identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as the causitive agent. The Ministry of Health in Beijing has informed WHO that the outbreak in Guandong is over and that there is no evidence of a link between the outbreak in Guandong and the H5N1 cases in Hong Kong SAR. The Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR has intensified its surveillance for influenza among patients with influenza-like symptoms or atypical pneumonia. No unusual increase in influenza activity has been detected over the past few weeks. WHO is continuing to work closely with health authorities in Beijing, China and Hong Kong SAR.

945,"("" 7 July 2011 - Pakistan has reported wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) isolated from a 16-month old child with onset of paralysis on 9 June 2011, from a conflict-affected, inaccessible area of Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). This is the only case of WPV3 detected in Asia in 2011. WPV3 transmission in Asia is on the verge of elimination, with the last case occurring more than six months ago, on 18 November 2010 (also from Khyber Agency, FATA). Confirmation of continuation of WPV3 transmission in tribal areas of Pakistan has significant implications for the global effort to eradicate WPV3, particularly as Asia is on the verge of eliminating circulation of this strain. The detection of WPV3 in Pakistan represents the risk that it may spread from this transmission focus to other WPV3-free areas of Asia and beyond. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at historically low levels in 2011, with other circulation of this strain restricted to parts of west Africa (17 cases in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali and Niger), Nigeria (five cases) and Chad (three cases). The risk of onward spread of WPV3 is deemed as high by the World Health Organization (WHO), particularly given large-scale population movements within Pakistan, between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and expected large-scale population movements associated with Umrah and the upcoming Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) in the coming few months. In 2011, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Pakistan have been inadequate in quality in key high-risk areas and a significant proportion of children remained inaccessible in conflict affected tribal areas. In FATA, particularly in Khyber agency, nearly 50% of children have been regularly missed during SIAs for the last two years. In addition to challenges relating to reaching children in insecure areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA, significant operational challenges continue to mar the quality of SIAs in accessible areas of Khyber and in other key transmission areas of the country, notably in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. In addition to confirmation of the only WPV3 case in Asia in 2011, Pakistan is affected by country-wide geographical transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), with 57 confirmed WPV1 cases in 2011 (as at 5 July 2011), compared with 14 WPV1 cases for the same period in 2010. To urgently address the situation, the Government of Pakistan has this year launched a National Polio Emergency Action Plan, under the auspices of His Excellency the President. However, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), set up at the request of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2010 to independently monitor progress towards a polio-free world, in April 2011 expressed alarm that the Plan is taking too long to implement, a conclusion echoed by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of the Eastern Mediterranean in June 2011. To rapidly build up immunity to both wild poliovirus strains, a Short Interval Additional Dose Strategy (SIAD) SIA with bivalent OPV is being conducted in Khyber Agency , the first passage on 4 July and the second on 12 July. It is expected that, as during the most recent SIAs in mid-June, 45% (89,449) of target children in Khyber Agency (80% in Bara Tehsil, i.e. approximately 73,000) will remain inaccessible during the SIADs. National Immunization Days (NIDs) will be conducted in the country on 18-20 July, using bivalent OPV (containing type 1 & 3 serotypes). However, key to success will be to overcome remaining operational challenges in fully-accessible areas and to implement special outreach strategies with full community participation to increase access to populations in security-compromised areas. To minimise the risk of WPV3 re-infecting Afghanistan, Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) - including in border areas with Pakistan - will be conducted in the country on 10-12 July, also using bivalent OPV. It is important that countries across Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response should importation occur. Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against all strains of polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Pakistan should be fully protected by vaccination. Travellers to Pakistan who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to Pakistan should complete a full course of vaccination. Travellers from Pakistan should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving Pakistan, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure. Some polio-free countries may also require travellers from Pakistan to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa. With Hajj and Umrah season already started, and Umrah expected to increase during Ramadan (in August) and Hajj in early November, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has vaccination requirements for travellers (all ages) for Umrah and Hajj. These requirements are in line with recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, with the addition that travellers of all ages from polio endemic countries are required to show proof of vaccination with OPV six weeks before travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and will receive a further dose of OPV upon their arrival. #### For more information "",)"

Of these human cases, 38 have been fatal. As reported by China, 18 patients are critically ill. Virtually all cases have occurred in Sichuan Province, where infections with Streptococcus suis have been detected in pigs in a concurrent outbreak. The province has one of the largest pig populations in China. Investigation and containment of the outbreak have been given high priority by Chinese authorities. The country’s ministries of health and agriculture are working in close collaboration, and WHO and FAO are being promptly informed of new developments. Investigations conducted by Chinese epidemiologists indicate that the first human cases occurred at the end of June in Ziyang City, Sichuan Province. From 24 June through 21 July, the authorities reported 20 cases of illness, of unknown cause, admitted to three hospitals in that city. WHO was officially informed of the outbreak on 22 July, at which time 20 cases and 9 deaths had been reported. Cases have since been reported in 11 prefectures in Sichuan Province. Most cases reported have occurred in adult male farmers. Information reported to WHO suggests that close contact with diseased or dead pigs is the principal source of human infection. Symptoms reported by local clinicians include high fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting, followed by meningitis, subcutaneous haemorrhage, toxic shock, and coma in severe cases. The incubation period is short and disease progression is rapid. Local experts are conducting active searches for further cases. To date, Chinese authorities say they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The outbreak in humans has some unusual features and is being closely followed by WHO.

This final review added an additional two cases between April to 5 July 2012, making the total number of children affected to be 59. Of these, 52 have died. The age of the cases range from three months to 11 years old, with the majority being under three years old. The overall male: female ratio is 1.3:1. Laboratory samples were not available for the majority of the cases as they died before appropriate samples could be taken. Based on the latest laboratory results, a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The EV-71 virus has been known to generally cause severe complications amongst some patients. Additionally, a number of other pathogens, including dengue and streptococcus suis were identified in some of the samples. The samples were found to be negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses, SARS and Nipah. Further investigations into matching the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological information are ongoing, and are likely to be concluded in a few days. WHO and partners, which include lnstitut Pasteur du Cambodge and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are assisting the Ministry of Health with this event. The Government is also reinforcing awareness of good hygiene practices to the public, which includes frequent washing of hands. #### Some facts on hand foot and mouth disease: Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been associated with serious complications in certain groups, and may cause deaths. HFMD mainly occurs amongst children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or two days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms, or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease. HFMD virus is contagious and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the first week of the illness but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease. Presently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD. Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms. Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids. ',)"
1224,"(' On 28 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Kenya notified WHO of an outbreak of Chikungunya in Mandera East sub-county. The first reports of an increase in cases with febrile illness and joint pains occurred in May 2016. Samples were collected and shipped to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Arboviral Laboratory in Nairobi. On 16 May, KEMRI laboratory confirmed 7 of the 10 samples tested positive for Chikungunya virus. All samples tested negative for other arboviruses including: dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. Moreover, from partial sequencing of the envelope gene it was observed that the CHIK isolates from Mandera are grouped with isolates from the post-2005 Indian Ocean islands, Asia and Europe. Full genome sequencing is underway. To date, KEMRI has received a total of 177 samples of suspected cases in the laboratory for testing. Of thse, 53 of these came from Somalia and rest from Mandera. 57 were positive by IgM antibody testing and 38 were positive for CHIK virus by RT-PCR. Of the positives, 9 were both IgM and PCR positive. As of 30 June 2016, 1,792 cases had been line listed. No deaths have been reported so far. However there is a risk of underreporting of cases since many patients are not reporting to health facilities. There have been outbreaks of Chikungunya in neighbouring Bula Hawa region in Somalia border region originating from Mogadishu. It is estimated that about 80% of the population and 50% of the health work force in Mandera town were affected by Chikungunya. Cases with severe debilitating joint pains were being managed as inpatients for a short duration for 1 or 2 days. However, the majority of the cases are not seeking treatment in health facilities. ### Public health response WHO country office supported the Ministry of Health to dispatch seven technical staff to support the County government of Mandera in risk assessment. WHO supported a rapid vector assessment survey, it was observed that most of the breeding habitats for the Aedes vectors for chikungunya in Mandera are within domiciliary containers mainly for water storage. The density of day-biting Aedes vectors were substantially high and County vector control activities were minimal. A cross border and coordination meeting between Somalia and Kenya took place on 30 May 2016 to coordinate joint response activities to control the outbreak. The meeting recommended a lead agency to coordinate response activities across the border and to improve coordinated surveillance and information sharing. Other partners who were part of the response included MSF and Kenya Red cross. MSF supplied 30,000 treated mosquito nets, which targeted about 30% coverage for the population at risk. The MOH also provided 5000 ITNs for hospital use and chemicals for vector control. The last outbreak of Chikungunya in Kenya was in 2004 and 2005, where at least 1,300 cases were documented. The affected areas were Lamu and Mombasa in the Coast region. A seroprevalence survey done in October 2004 suggested that 75% of the population in Lamu had been affected. ### WHO risk assessment In the past, the outbreak that began in 2004, on the Kenyan coast reached the Comoros at the end of 2004 before spreading to the Indian Ocean islands in 2005. A mutation in the E1 gene and selection chikungunya virus strains that increase adaptation of the virus to one of the vector Aedes albopictus and therefore significantly increase transmissibility has likely occurred in Reunion Island at the end of 2005 and resulted in an unprecedented outbreak and a further spread to the rest of the world. If confirmed the preliminary sequencing results the circulation of the mutated chikungunya stain could yield significantly higher attack rate than with the formerly circulating African strain. Ae albopictus is an invasive species that continues to expand geographically in various parts of the world, could therefore represent a further risk of geographical extension the current outbreak in the affected countries and beyond . The risk for a moderate to high scale outbreak of Chikungunya in the area cannot be ruled out due to the presence of the disease vector, immunologically naive population and potential upcoming rains in the area. Besides potential cross border span of the outbreak, under-reporting of cases and low levels of health seeking behaviours among the affected population is concerning. ',)"

Information about the nature of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was highlighted. This was followed by outlining the essential components for control, including the need for national leadership, improved care and case management, identifying transmission chains and stopping disease spread, and preventing further outbreaks. Among the critical issues are: cross-border infections and travelers; partners reaching the limits of their capacity and ability to respond rapidly, safely, and effectively; and concerns about the socio-economic impact of continued transmission. The Director-General also shared information from her recent meetings in Guinea with Member States of the Mano River Union – Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. She outlined that the response in West Africa would focus on three areas: * Treatment of Guéckédou, Kenema, and Foya as a unified sector, which will include public health measures meant to reduce movement in and out of the area. * Intensifying current measures in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. * Taking steps to reduce international spread to other countries in Africa and outside of the African Region. The Sub-regional Ebola Operations Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry reported on 5 August that the following actions are underway in the four affected countries: * In Guinea, new foci have emerged and case management facilities will be needed. Exit screening is currently being tested in Conakry, in partnership with the US CDC. * In Liberia, security issues continue to be of concern, notwithstanding the commitment of the Government. Community resistance remains high. * In Nigeria, the Government is focused on following up the contacts from the index case. Clinical support is urgently needed and a treatment centre is being set up for managing cases of EVD. * In Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to map where treatment centres are most needed and getting those set up. A similar exercise is underway for laboratories. The SEOCC is assisting countries with these and many other response measures. On 6 August, WHO is convening an Emergency Committee of international experts to review the outbreak and advise the Director-General, in accordance with the International Health Regulations, whether the Ebola virus disease outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Experts will receive an epidemiological briefing and will determine whether the criteria for a PHEIC have been met. If the Emergency Committee agrees that this is a PHEIC, they will then advise the Director-General on temporary recommendations. A summary of the meeting will be made public and a press briefing will be held on Friday, 8 August. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Between 2 and 4 August 2014, 108 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD and 45 deaths were reported from the four countries as follows: Guinea, 10 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 48 new cases and 27 deaths; Nigeria, 5 new cases and 0 death; and Sierra Leone, 45 new cases and 13 deaths. As of 4 August 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the four countries stands at 1 711, including 932 deaths.

1207,"(' On 16 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of a male infant with microcephaly born in the state of Hawaii in December. The mother of the child experienced symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection during her second month of pregnancy, while residing in Brazil; however, at the time, testing for the infection was not performed. Within the first week after birth, cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples were collected from the infant. The samples showed serologic evidence of recent Zika virus infection by IgM enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Serum collected from the infant’s mother during the week after the infant’s birth showed serologic evidence of recent infection with a flavivirus by IgM ELISA and confirmatory PRNT. ### WHO risk assessment This case report adds to the growing literature on Zika virus and microcephaly. Although evidence concerning a potential association between Zika virus and congenital neurological disorders among newborns is mounting, the available information is not yet sufficient to establish such a causative link. Further investigations are, therefore, required. Until more is understood, Members States are advised to standardize and enhance surveillance for microcephaly and other neurological disorders, particularly in areas of known Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such transmission. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Zika-affected countries based on the current information available. ',)"
8,"(' 05 February 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported A total of 367 cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) were reported to the Ministry of Health for the period January to November 1995, with a least five deaths. Cases occurred in all months of the year, with a low of six cases in February and highs of 75 in March and 54 in August. Age and sex data are not available. Examination of patient sera found evidence of infection by at least two hantaviruses, Puumala, cause of a less severe form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome often called nephropathia epidemica elsewhere in Europe, and Hantaan or a closely related virus, cause of a more severe form more often leading to death. Additional hantaviruses that also cause human disease may be in circulation in the area. The viruses which cause HFRS are maintained in nature by field rodents, and infections of humans is thought to occur when people come into contact with infectious rodent excrete, often by aerosol route. War conditions favour transmission of hantaviruses since soldiers and displaced persons are forced to live in conditions conducive to increased contact with field rodents, thereby increasing their risk of infection.

631,"(' 5 January 2004 Results from laboratory tests received today have confirmed a case of SARS in a 32-year-old man in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The patient is a television producer who has been under treatment, in isolation, at a hospital in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, since 20 December. This is the first confirmed case of SARS in 2004, and the first case not linked to a laboratory accident that has occurred since the initial outbreak of SARS was declared contained on 5 July 2003. Laboratory-related cases occurred after that date in Singapore in September and in Taiwan, China in December of last year. The Guangdong case has been under investigation, with WHO support, since 26 December, when the suspected case was initially reported by Chinese authorities. Previous diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results. In view of the limitations of SARS diagnostic tests, confirmation of positive results by a WHO-designated reference laboratory is required for a definitive diagnosis of SARS. The confirmatory tests were conducted in Hong Kong by both the University of Hong Kong at the Queen Mary Hospital and the Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health. Both laboratories are members of the WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Diagnosis that collectively identified the SARS coronavirus in mid-April 2003, and have considerable diagnostic expertise. The source of infection for this newly confirmed case remains unclear. Several lines of investigation last year suggest that SARS may have originated from contact with wild animals sold for human consumption at live markets in southern China. Studies conducted last year detected a SARS-like virus in some animal species, including the masked palm civet. Retrospective analysis of patient records has linked several of the earliest cases, which began occurring in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, to contact with wild animals. However, no animal reservoir of the SARS coronavirus has been conclusively identified to date. Epidemiological investigations in China have not yet been able to link the patient to exposure to wild animals or any other known or suspected source of the virus. Chinese authorities have introduced several measures as investigation of the case has evolved. The patient has been treated in isolation since his hospitalization on 20 December, four days after the onset of symptoms. All contacts have been traced and followed up. All are reported to be free of symptoms and most have been released from quarantine, suggesting that no further transmission has occurred. Surveillance for additional cases has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces. The single isolated case does not constitute grounds for issuing a SARS alert or recommending any restrictions on travel or trade. At the request of Chinese authorities, additional WHO teams are being sent this week to assist in research aimed at identifying the source of infection and preventing further cases. The first cases of SARS occurred in Guangdong in mid-November 2002. The disease began to spread internationally in late February 2003, eventually causing more than 8000 cases, with 774 deaths, in 27 countries. ',)"

The last case was confirmed on 3 August 2012 and was discharged from the hospital on 24 August 2012. This is double the maximum incubation period (21 days) for Ebola as recommended by WHO. In the outbreak, a total of 24 probable and confirmed cases were recorded, of which 11 were laboratory confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe. A total of 17 deaths were reported in this outbreak. National and District Ebola Task Forces were coordinated by the MoH to respond to the outbreak. MoH worked closely with WHO and other agencies which included the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), EMESCO Foundation (a local NGO), Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), US Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC), US Agency for International Development (USAID). WHO also coordinated with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to support the response operations. The response activities carried out during the outbreak included enhanced surveillance for early case detection and contact tracing, reinforcement of infection prevention and control including case management in isolation facilities using barrier nursing and conducting supervised safe burials, reinforcement of standard precautions in health care settings and enhancing communication interventions at the national and community levels. A team led by CDC conducted ecological studies in Kibaale district to try and understand the likely source and route of transmission of the virus. Samples from bats, primates and livestock were collected to study the possible source of the Ebola virus and putative initial human infection from wildlife. The Ebola response teams have continued to educate the community on prevention, detection of and early reporting of any suspected cases in future. Health workers in the district have been trained on prevention of health care associated infections. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to the Uganda with respect to this event. ### General information on Ebola subtypes There are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location where they were been first detected in EHF outbreaks. Three subtypes of the five have been associated with large EHF outbreaks in Africa. Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan and Ebola-Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25-90% of all cases. The Ebola Reston species, found in the Philippines, can infect humans, but no illness or death in humans has been reported to date. "",)"

947,"("" 20 September 2011 - Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) genetically linked to virus currently circulating in Pakistan has been isolated in China. Pakistan is affected by nationwide transmission of WPV1, and is the location of the only wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) case in Asia in 2011 (a strain on the verge of elimination on the continent). As at 13 September 2011, Pakistan had reported 84 cases, compared to 48 cases for the same period in 2010. In 2011, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Pakistan have been inadequate in quality in key high-risk areas. In security-compromised parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and in particular in Khyber agency, upwards of 200,000 children have been regularly missed during SIAs conducted during the last two years. In addition to challenges relating to reaching children in insecure areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA, significant operational challenges continue to mar the quality of SIAs in accessible areas of Khyber and in other key transmission areas of the country, notably in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. At the same time, undetected circulation cannot be ruled out due to persistent subnational surveillance gaps. Given these factors, the widespread transmission of WPV1, documented spread internationally, and the detection of the only WPV3 in Asia in 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) rates as 'high' the risk of further international spread of WPV from Pakistan, particularly given the expected large-scale population movements associated with Umrah and the upcoming Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) in the coming months. To urgently address the widespread transmission of wild poliovirus affecting the country, the Government of Pakistan has this year launched a National Polio Emergency Action Plan, under the auspices His Excellency the President. However, the impact of the Plan is not yet being seen at the critical programme implementation level. To rapidly build up population immunity levels to both serotypes, staggered subnational immunization days are planned for 19-21 September, to be closely followed by further activities in high-risk union councils in 54 districts of the country. However, key to success will be to overcome remaining operational challenges in fully-accessible areas and implemented special outreach strategies with full community participation to increase access to populations in security-compromised areas. To achieve this, full and consistent engagement and accountability at provincial, district and union-council level is urgently needed. It is important that countries across Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response should importation occur. Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against all strains of polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Pakistan should be fully protected by vaccination. Travellers to Pakistan who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to Pakistan should complete a full course of vaccination. Travellers from Pakistan should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving Pakistan, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure. Some polio-free countries may also require travellers from Pakistan to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa. With Hajj and Umrah season already started, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has issued vaccination requirements for travellers (all ages) for Umrah and Hajj. These requirements are in line with recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, with the addition that travellers of all ages from polio endemic countries are required to show proof of vaccination with OPV six weeks before travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and will receive a further dose of OPV upon their arrival. #### For more information "",)"

1018,"(' 11 April 2013 - As of 11 April 2013 (17:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 10 laboratory- confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus. The patients include: * a 70-year-old man from Jiangsu who became ill on 29 March 2013; * a 74-year-old man from Jiangsu who became ill on 2 April 2013; * a 65-year-old man from Zhejiang who became ill on 3 April 2013; * a 76-year-old woman from Shanghai who became ill on 1 April 2013; * an 81-year-old woman from Shanghai who became ill on 4 April 2013; * a 74-year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on 31 March 2013 and died on 11 April 2013; * an 83-year-old woman from Shanghai who became ill on 2 April 2013; * a 68-year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on 4 April 2013; * a 31-year-old man from Jiangsu who became ill on 31 March 2013; and * a 56-year-old man from Jiangsu who became ill on 3 April 2013. To date, a total of 38 patients have been laboratory confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China; including 10 deaths, 19 severe cases and nine mild cases. More than 760 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance. Retrospective testing of recently reported cases with severe respiratory infection may uncover additional cases that were previously unrecognized. An inter-government task force has been formally established, with the National Health and Family Planning Commission leading the coordination along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other key ministries. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that information is available and that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). At this time there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied. ### About this Disease Outbreak News 1\\. WHO is currently publishing information on laboratory confirmed cases received through the official notification from the Chinese National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point once a day. This formal notification and publication follows verification of the information, and may therefore come after, or not include, some cases reported through public media and other sources. 2\\. To date, there is limited information to determine whether the reported number of cases represents some or all of the cases actually occurring. As some relatively mild cases of illness have now been reported, it is possible that there are other such cases that have not been identified and reported. 3\\. If the current pattern of sporadic infections continues, WHO will cease frequent reporting of case numbers, and focus its Disease Outbreak News on new developments or changes in the pattern or presentation of infections.

123,"(' 06 December 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported The UNHCR has reported on action taken as a result of the laboratory confirmation of cholera on 23 November in a refugee from a Kigoma holding centre. Cholera has since been confirmed in all three holding centres in Kigoma town. As at 4 December, 1 100 cases of presumed cholera had been detected (note: the case definition of presumed cholera is only ""watery diarrhoea"") in the refugee population; six were fatal - three among children under 10 years of age and three in patients over 60 years of age. Six percent of the 1 100 presumed cases required IV rehydration. The population in the holding centres is estimated at 25 000. The number fluctuates as refugees continue to arrive from Zaire and others are transferred from the holding centres to the camps. Based on a total refugee population at risk the 1 100 cases detected correspond to a daily incidence of watery diarrhoea of 5-8 per 1 000. Incidence of bloody diarrhoea is 2 to 3 per thousand per day. Action taken: Improving water, sanitation and living conditions in all three Kigoma holding centres was the first priority. Latrines have been built, water is now available almost continuously and trucks are transporting people out of the holding centres to the camps at a rate of 1 000 persons per day, weather permitting. Daily surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in all camps and holding centres by IRC, MSF and UNHCR is coupled with active case-finding in the holding centres by community health workers. MSF has set up an emergency treatment area in one of the holding centres for oral and IV rehydration and strict hygienic control of the cholera patients. Nyarugusu Camp, which is receiving most of the refugees transferred out of the holding centres, is also ready to treat patients with cholera. Ujiji Hospital, which has a special diarrhoea ward, is being upgraded by MSF logistics. Wards are being rebuilt, electricity is brought in, extra latrines are under construction. Forty extra beds, in addition to the existing 10, will be made available this week. Vibrio cholerae cultures obtained from both refugees and locals have been sent to the Tanzanian Reference Laboratory for confirmation, grouping and sensitivity testing. Supplies have also been ordered to allow the local laboratory technician to work on identification and sensitivity testing of cholera strains, as well as shigella strains, should a shigella outbreak occurs.

1234,"(' On 9 May 2017, WHO was informed of a cluster of undiagnosed illness and deaths including haemorrhagic symptoms in Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province in the north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), bordering Central African Republic. Since 22 April, nine cases including three deaths have been reported. Six cases are currently hospitalized. On 11 May 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of DRC informed WHO that of the five samples collected from suspected cases, one tested positive by RT-PCR for Ebola virus subtype Zaire at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. Additional specimens are currently being tested and results, including sequencing, are awaited to describe the outbreak. On 10 May 2017, a multidisciplinary team led by the MoH and supported by WHO and partners was deployed to the field and are expected to reach the affected area on 12 or 13 May 2017 to conduct an in depth field investigation. The investigation is currently ongoing and information is available for only three of the suspected cases: The first case (and possibly the index case), a 39-year-old male presented onset of symptoms on 22 April 2017 and deceased on arrival at the health facility. He presented with haematuria, epistaxis, bloody diarrhoea, and haematemesis. Two contacts of this case are being investigated: a person who took care of him during transport to the health care facility (he has since developed similar symptoms) and a moto-taxi driver (deceased) who transported the patient to the health care facility. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for health care workers has been shipped on 12 May 2017 to Kisangani. Additional kits are currently being prepared and will be shipped as soon as available. ### Background and epidemiological situation On 20 November 2014, as per WHO recommendations, the MoH of DRC and WHO declared the end of the EVD outbreak that started on 24 August 2014 and resulted in a total of 38 laboratory confirmed cases and 28 probable case including 49 deaths in Boende, Equateur province. This was the seventh outbreak of EVD since its discovery in 1976 in DRC. * 2014: 66 cases of EVD including 49 deaths diagnosed initially in Equateur province (Watsi Kengo, Lokolia, Boende, and Boende Muke). * 2012: 36 cases including 13 deaths Orientale province - Isiro (Bundibugyo virus). * 2008–2009: 32 cases including 15 deaths in Kasaï-Occidental (Zaire virus). * 2007: 264 cases including 187 deaths in Kasaï-Occidental (Zaire virus). * 1995: 315 cases and 250 deaths occurred in Kikwit and surrounding area. * 1977: 1 case (Zaire virus). * 1976: 318 cases including 280 deaths in Yambuku (Zaire virus). There are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location where they have been first detected. Three of the five subtypes have been associated with large Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in Africa. Ebola–Zaire, Ebola–Sudan and Ebola–Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25–90% of all cases. ### Public health response The following public health response measures have been implemented: * The national committee against viral haemorrhagic fever has been reactivated and will continue meeting every day to coordinate the response. * Strengthening of surveillance and investigation including contact tracing are ongoing. * WHO will provide assistance and technical support. The deployment to DRC of an additional WHO multidisciplinary team is currently considered to support the response of national authorities. * The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has been activated to provide additional support if required. * The need and feasibility of potential Ebola ring vaccination is being discussed. ### WHO risk assessment To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote and hard to reach area and appears to be geographically relatively limited. However, Investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance still needs to be maintained. WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to DRC based on the currently available information. ',)"
1242,"(' Since the beginning of 2017, Kenya is experiencing an upsurge of cholera cases. The first cholera outbreak reported in 2017 was in Tana River County. The outbreak started on 10 October 2016 and was controlled by April 2017. A second wave of cholera outbreaks started in Garissa County on 2 April 2017 and was reported later in nine other counties including Nairobi, Murang’a, Vihiga, Mombasa, Turkana, Kericho, Nakuru, Kiambu, and Narok. The outbreak is being reported in the general population and in refugee camps. In Garissa County, the outbreak is affecting mainly Dadaab refugee camps and cases and deaths are being reported from Hagadera, Dagahaleh, and IFO2 camps. In Turkana county, the disease is also affecting Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps. In addition to the outbreak reported in the general population, there have been two point source cholera outbreaks in Nairobi County. One occurred among participants attending a conference in a Nairobi hotel on 22 June 2017. A total of 146 patients associated with this outbreak have been treated in different hospitals in Nairobi. A second outbreak occurred at the China Trade Fair held at the KICC Tsavo Ball between 10 and 12 July 2017. A total of 136 cases were reported and one death. Currently, the outbreak is active in two counties, namely Garissa and Nairobi. As of 17 July 2017, a total of 1216 suspected cases including 14 deaths (case fatality rate: 1.2%) have been reported since 1 January 2017. In the week ending 16 July 2017, a total of 38 cases with no deaths were reported. A total of 124 cases tested positive for Vibrio cholerae in the reference laboratory. In the week ending 25 June 2017, 18 samples out of 25 tested positive for Vibrio cholerae Ogawa by culture at the National Public Health Laboratory in Nairobi. The main causative factors of the current outbreak include the high population density that is conducive to the propagation and spread of the disease, mass gatherings (a wedding party held in Karen and in a hotel during an international conference), low access to safe water and proper sanitation and the massive population movements in country and with neighbouring countries. Since December 2014, the Republic of Kenya has been experiencing continuous large outbreaks of cholera, with a cumulative total of 17 597 cases reported (10 568 cases reported in 2015 and 6448 in 2016). ### Public health response The country has activated the national task force to coordinate the response to the outbreak. Since January 2017, WHO and partners are providing technical support to the country for the control of the outbreak. The country will develop a response plan with focus on the preparedness interventions to avert further spread of the outbreak. The WHO country office will repurpose their staff members and experts deployed in Nairobi for the management of the post El Niño effects in the Horn of Africa to support the quick control of this outbreak. WHO will also support the five most at risk counties with disease surveillance and response coordination. Partners on the ground are committed to provide support to the ongoing response efforts including support to primary health care and social mobilization by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). ### WHO risk assessment Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of bacterium Vibrio cholerae present in faecally contaminated water or food. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is always considered a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the exposure frequency, population exposed and the context. Cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Republic of Kenya every year with large cyclical epidemics every five to seven years. The risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at national and regional levels and moderate at global level. The outbreak occurred in the context of a sub-regional drought, conflicts and insecurity in the Horn of Africa. In addition, the outbreak is affecting the densely populated capital city Nairobi, and two large refugee camps (Kakuma and Dadaab) with massive population movements within country and between neighbouring countries. Previous large outbreaks in the Republic of Kenya have originated from similar settings, and the risk for propagation of cholera within the affected area as well as to other parts of the country is high. The country has identified a limited capacity for response and low access to safe water. There is an opportunity to implement early preparedness and response measures to contain the outbreak and prevent spread. The current outbreaks linked to mass gathering activities poses additional risk of food safety as well as the need to conduct sanitary inspection in restaurants and hotels. ### WHO recommendations WHO recommends improving the readiness of counties and health facilities to early detect and respond to the cholera outbreak as well as the reinforcement of coordination and multisectoral approaches. In addition, hygiene practices in households, restaurant, hotels, refugee camps and health facilities should be improved and food safety interventions should be strengthened. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Republic of Kenya based on the information available on the current outbreak. ',)"
1410,"(' 1 July 2005 On 24 June 2005, the Ministry of Health of Angola reported a polio case. Angola has not had a case of polio since 2001. A 17-month old girl with a previous history of oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed fever and paralysis in both legs on 25 April, in the metropolitan area of the capital, Luanda. Genetic sequencing of the type-1 wild poliovirus shows that it originated in India. Virological and epidemiological evidence suggest a recent importation. The affected child and her family have no travel history. An investigation did not detect spread beyond the community. Outreach from routine immunization services has been stepped up in advance of the campaign. The national routine immunization coverage of children against polio is estimated to be 45%. A nationwide polio vaccination campaign is planned 29-31 July. Authorities are considering the use of a combination of monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV) in the immediate area of the case and trivalent oral polio vaccine in the rest of the country for maximum impact. This will be followed by another round in August. Health authorities have immediately intensified Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance in the infected district and surrounding areas and WHO/African Region has notified neighbouring countries.

1298,"(' On 17 January 2019, two genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were reported from Molumbo district, Zambezia province, Mozambique. The first one, was from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case with onset of paralysis on 21 October 2018, a six-year old girl with no history of vaccination, and the second isolate was from a community contact of the first case, a child aged one-year old. ### Public health response WHO and partners at the regional and country level are assisting the Ministry of Health and local public health authorities to conduct a thorough field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological), to assess the extent and original source of circulation of this virus more clearly, and to further plan and support the implementation of an outbreak response as appropriate, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. While national routine oral polio vaccine type 3 (OPV3) immunization coverage in 2017 was estimated at 80%, population immunity gaps remain at subnational levels, especially in Zambézia province (with 60% OPV3 coverage). ### WHO risk assessment WHO assessed the overall public health risk at the national level to be high due to a decline in population immunity to type 2 poliovirus and the risk of international spread to be medium due to ongoing population movements. The detection of cVDPV2 underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation and underscores the risk posed by any medium to low- level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniform high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that before travelling to areas with active poliovirus transmission, travellers from polio-free countries should ensure that they have completed the age-appropriate polio vaccination series, according to their respective national immunization schedule. Travellers to polio-infected areas who completed an OPV or IPV vaccine series more than 12 months previously should be given another one-time booster dose of polio vaccine. Before travelling abroad, persons of all ages residing in polio-infected countries (i.e. those with active transmission of a wild or vaccine derived poliovirus) and long-term visitors to such countries (i.e. persons who spend more than four weeks in the country) should have completed a full course of vaccination against polio in compliance with the national schedule. Travellers from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel to boost intestinal mucosal immunity and reduce the risk of poliovirus shedding, which could lead to reintroduction of poliovirus into a polio free area. For persons who previously received only IPV, OPV should be the choice for the booster dose, if available and feasible. In case of unavoidable last-minute travel, travellers who have not received a documented dose of polio vaccine within the previous 12 months should still receive one dose of OPV or IPV before departure. Updates on currently or recently infected countries can be found on the website of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication such as adequate vaccination of international travellers; intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data and intensify cross border efforts. In addition, the Committee emphasized that states infected with cVDPV2 should encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel. States should ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status. The Committee also noted the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections and recommended that States should consider requesting vaccines from the global monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2.

1260,"(' On 27 October 2017, the Ministry of Health in Mozambique notified WHO of an outbreak of cholera. From 14 August 2017 through 11 February 2018, 1799 cases and one death (case fatality rate = 0.06%) of cholera were reported from the two provinces; Nampula (1580 cases) and Cabo Delgado (219 cases). Underreporting of the number of cases and deaths is likely. This outbreak has been confirmed by Rapid Diagnostic Tests and culture. The outbreak started in Memba district in the north-eastern province Nampula and spread to Erati district by 15 October 2017. By 19 November, the outbreak had spread to two further districts in the same province (Nacaroa and Nampula city). Case incidence peaked in mid-November with 252 cases reported in one week; this peak was followed by a rapid decrease in reported cases (figure 1). A slow increase in the number of cases reported has been observed since late December 2017. On 5 January 2018, the first cases were reported from Pemba City in Cabo Delgado Province which is north of Nampula. In 2018 so far, the weekly number of cases have fluctuated between 30 and 60 cases. #### Figure 1: Number of cholera cases in Mozambique reported by the week of illness onset from 14 August 2017 through 11 February 2018 Cholera outbreaks have occurred in Mozambique every year for the past five years. The most recent outbreak prior to the current outbreak started in January 2017 and ended in April 2017, and resulted in a total of 2129 cases and four deaths (case fatality rate= 0.2%). Three provinces and six districts were affected in the 2017 outbreak (Tete, Nampula, and Maputo province). ### Public health response WHO and partners are supporting response activities to contain the outbreak. The following response measures are ongoing: * The Ministry of Health is leading a weekly coordination meeting at the national level to discuss the ongoing response. Partners including WHO, UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and the Red Cross attend and support the meeting. * Multi-sectoral coordination particularly at the district level; coordinating response actions between the different sectors and it is led by district officials. * WHO has conducted a rapid assessment of the situation in Nampula province and has shared the findings at the national coordination meeting. * WHO has supported training on case management and surveillance in Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces to improve case management, case detection, and reporting. * With support from UNICEF, national and local health authorities have provided logistical support to set up and supply cholera treatment centers with consumable, medication, and infection prevention and control supplies. Cholera treatment centers have been set up in each of the affected districts. * There are efforts to improve water quality, sanitation conditions, and hygiene practices in the affected districts are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities and water supply sector with the support of partners. * Social mobilization and risk communication activities are ongoing; led by national and local health authorities with the support of partners. ### WHO risk assessment Risk factors contributing to the propagation of cholera to other provinces and districts in this outbreak include a shortage of potable water and contamination of household drinking water, which emphasize the need to improve access to clean water, adequate hygiene, and sanitation. The three provinces which have reported cholera cases in this outbreak have been severely affected by the flooding which has resulted in the displacement of people and damage to the infrastructure, including health facilities. The meteorological forecast indicates that this heavy rainfall will continue for the next three months which may contribute to the potential spread of the outbreak. It is not possible to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, as no epidemiological or environmental investigations have been conducted in the two affected provinces and disease risk factors are unknown. Priorities at this stage are to strengthen the surveillance system, and harmonizing cholera data collection and line listing of the cases, as well as putting in place a mechanism for active case finding at the community level. In addition, the cholera case definition should be strictly applied to all suspected cases to decrease underreporting and to improve case detection in this outbreak. Other response activities such as case management, implementation of WASH interventions and social mobilization also need to be strengthened at the national, provincial, district and community levels. The overall risk is assessed as high at the national level; this assessment is partially due to the lack of information regarding the current outbreak dynamics and response actions. The risk is assessed to be low at the regional and global levels. ### WHO advice WHO recommends improving access to safe water, sanitation capacities, and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to case management should be improved in the affected areas. National capacity to rapidly detect and respond is needed if the outbreak spreads to other areas. The provision of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread of the outbreak should also be considered. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Mozambique based on the information available. The use of safe drinking water and the implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.

1103,"(' Based on epidemiological analysis conducted by WHO, three major factors are contributing to patterns of transmission, which are currently responsible for the continuous propagation of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the sub-region. These factors include transmission of EVD in rural communities, facilitated by strong cultural practices and traditional beliefs; transmission of EVD in densely populated peri-urban areas of Conakry in Guinea and Monrovia in Liberia; and cross-border transmission of EVD along the border areas of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where commercial and social activities continue among the border areas of these countries. ### Health sector response Containment of this outbreak requires a strong response in the countries and especially along their shared border areas. As one of the response elements, WHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub- region scheduled for 2–3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The meeting will bring together Ministers of Health and the Directors of disease prevention and control from 11 African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors, representatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities. The objective of the meeting is to analyse the situation, identify gaps, develop operational response plans, and to ensure increased political commitment and enhanced cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO and technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), including the EU Mobile Laboratory consortium, the IFRC, and national societies, Institut Pasteur Dakar, Institut Pasteur Lyon, Institut Pasteur Paris, Bernard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors without Borders, Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health England, and US CDC, together with UN agencies, DFID, EU, ECHO, and other partners are providing the necessary technical expertise and support to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. WHO is closely supporting the Ministries of Health through the deployment of additional experts in various specialties, providing field logistics support, and personal protective equipment and medical supplies. These experts are drawn from WHO offices, GOARN partners, specialised networks, especially in the region, and include: * Field epidemiologists, who are working with the countries in surveillance and monitoring of the outbreak; * Laboratory experts who are providing mobile field laboratories in early confirmation of Ebola cases; * Clinical management experts who are deployed to health facilities and are treating affected patients; * Infection and prevention control experts who are helping countries in their ongoing efforts to stop transmission of the virus in the community and health-care facilities; * Logisticians who are ensuring an operational response platform, and dispatching essential equipment and needed materials; and * Social mobilization and risk communications teams who are helping public health officials to develop and deliver appropriate messages about how to report, handle, and treat Ebola cases. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 25 and 30 June 2014, 22 new cases of EVD, including 14 deaths, were reported from the three countries, as follows: Guinea, 3 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 8 new cases with 7 deaths; and Sierra Leone 11 new cases and 2 deaths.

956,"(' 7 OCTOBER 2011 - In 2011 several large measles outbreaks have been reported from Member States in the European and African regions, with several reported outbreaks in the Americas linked to Europe or Africa. Europe: As of 20 September 2011, 40 of 53 Member States in the WHO European Region have reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases for the period January – July 2011 to the WHO European Regional Office through routine surveillance and outbreak reports. The highest number of cases was reported from France with 14 025 cases for the first six months of the year. In addition, eleven of all cases in the Region were lethal (6 in France and one in each of Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The predominant genotype currently circulating in the European Region is D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The most recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September, with 12 cases. Member States have responded to the outbreak by modifying the vaccination schedule, like France, or by offering vaccination free of charge or in schools, to increase accessibility to and availability of vaccines. Africa: The Regional Office reports that as of September 2011 large measles outbreaks are being reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with over 103 000 cases, Nigeria, with 17 428 cases, and Zambia, with 5 397 cases, and Ethiopia, with 2 902 cases. Even though deaths are not routinely reported to the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reports over 1100 measles-associated deaths in the country during 2011. Americas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the region in 2002. In 2011 the Region has received reports of several outbreaks linked to importation of measles virus from other regions. The largest, in Quebec, Canada, involves 742 reported cases, 89 requiring hospitalization, but no measles-associated deaths. Other outbreaks have been reported from the United States (213 cases), Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Columbia (7 cases), Mexico (3 cases), and Chile (6 cases). Most of these outbreaks are linked to importations from Europe, except for outbreaks in the United States and Chile linked to cases from Malaysia and the outbreak in Ecuador, linked to Kenya. Measles is a highly infectious disease that causes complications and deaths, even in previously-healthy individuals, but is fully preventable by vaccination. Countries need to ensure that they reach 95% coverage with two doses of measles vaccine across all age groups up to 15 years of age. Otherwise the country will experience measles outbreaks with large numbers of cases, associated hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in countries with high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles exportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region of the Americas or certain African countries. These exportations can lead to large outbreaks and associated deaths. These outbreaks should remind travellers that they should ensure that they have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine before their trip. ',)"

1310,"In the Western Pacific Region (WPR), there has been a significant increase in reported measles cases between 2016 and 2017, with a 31% rise in cases. However, in 2018, there was a decrease in cases reported in WPR, with 26,163 cases reported compared to 11,118 in 2017. This resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO regions, with an unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas in WPR in 2019. Nine countries and areas in WPR have achieved measles elimination, but several countries and areas have reported outbreaks due to low immunization coverage and vaccine hesitancy. The WHO Regional Office for WPR is urging Member States to intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever, intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all cases, and ensure contingency resources are available for outbreak investigation and response immunization. The recent outbreaks have been fuelled by low immunization coverage, low immunization coverage among subpopulations, movement of people domestically and internationally, and vaccine hesitancy. Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing “zero-dose” to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread. * Update and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO’s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. WHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel restrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide how best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and communities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports, including on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful adjunct to raising measles awareness in the community. People planning international travel should ensure they have been vaccinated against measles because of the high risk of exposure to the measles virus from fellow travellers and in many countries in the world where measles is currently spreading. The current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to renew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures detailed in the “Measles Elimination Field Guide”1 and the “Regional Strategy and Plan of Action”2 to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the risk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission. * * * 1Measles Elimination Field Guide (WPR, 2013) 2Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific (WPR, 2018) 3The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (EURO, 2013) ',)"

To correct this misunderstanding, WHO called a press conference at the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva on 14 August. Dr Isabelle Nuttall, speaking on behalf of WHO, said, “Air travel, even from Ebola-affected countries, is low-risk for Ebola transmission.” Dr Nuttall further clarified modes of transmission for Ebola and emphasized that the disease is not an airborne virus, unlike influenza or tuberculosis. The infection is transmitted to others through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person, such as blood, vomit, sweat, and diarrhoea. Even if an individual infected with EVD travels by plane, the likelihood of other passengers and crew coming into contact with the individual’s bodily fluids is very low. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.) Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at: On 13 August, Heads of Global Information Systems (GIS) for WHO, UN agencies, intergovernmental agencies, and partners met to continue mapping the EVD crisis and create an interagency common operations picture.

1037,"(' 1 October 2013 - Three suspected cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from South Sudan are currently being investigated. All three patients are girls, two of whom are approximately two-years-old and one is eight-years-old. All had previously been immunized with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Two of the patients are from North Bahr El Gazal state (close to the border with Sudan), and one is from Eastern Equatoria state (close to the border with Kenya and Uganda). They developed paralysis between 15-24 August 2013. Genetic sequencing is ongoing to provide final confirmation of the laboratory results to determine the origin of the isolated viruses. The Horn of Africa is currently experiencing an outbreak of WPV1, with 174 cases in Somalia, 14 cases in Kenya and three cases in Ethiopia. Because of the routes of poliovirus spread in previous Horn of Africa outbreaks, South Sudan had been considered at high risk of re-infection. In 2013, South Sudan conducted two National Immunization Days (NIDs) in March 2013 and April 2013, with additional NIDs planned for November 2013 and December 2013. Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) were conducted in August 2013. Contingency plans for an emergency outbreak response are currently being finalized, including an immediate supplementary immunization activity (SIA) in and around the infected areas. An international team of experts is being deployed to South Sudan, to assist the local authorities in further case investigations, planning for appropriate outbreak response, and further intensifying active searches for additional potential cases. Immunization rates in neighbouring Sudan and Uganda are also being assessed to determine overall population immunity levels. As needed, additional SIAs will be conducted to help fill any identified immunity gaps. Uganda conducted SNIDs in July 2013 and September 2013, with further SNIDs planned for October 2013 and NIDs in December 2013. Sudan plans to conduct NIDs in November 2013 and December 2013. Outbreak response in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia is continuing. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with poliovirus-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Through its Regional Offices for Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, the World Health Organization (WHO) is continuing its support to countries in planning and implementing emergency outbreak response activities across the region. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. ',)"

1053,"(' 1 April 2014 - In this update and subsequent ones, the terminology Ebola haemorrhagic fever will be replaced by Ebola virus disease (EVD) in line with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Therefore, this report provides an update on Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. As at 31 March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 122 clinically compatible cases of EVD, of which 24 are laboratory confirmed by PCR, and 98 are probable (78) or suspected (22) cases. This total number includes 80 deaths, of which 13 (16%) have been laboratory confirmed for EVD and the remaining 67 are considered as probable cases of EVD. These figures correspond to 19 new clinical cases and 14 new deaths since the 28 March. As of 30 March, 20 patients remain in isolation. Eleven health-care workers are among the probable and suspected cases. Cases have been reported from Conakry (11), Guekedou (77), Macenta (23), Kissidougou (8), and 3 from Dabola and Djingaraye combined. Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 400 contacts under medical follow-up at present. Further strengthening of infection prevention and control in health-care facilities is a priority intervention. In addition, efforts are continuing to raise awareness in the community about the importance of personal protective measures to prevent ebolavirus transmission including hand washing, caring for the sick safely in the community, the use of personal protective equipment when handling potentially contaminated blood and body fluids and during environmental cleaning and disinfection, and safe burials. The Ministry of Health of Liberia has reported 8 clinically compatible cases of EVD, including 2 laboratory-confirmed cases, from 14 to 30 March. The 2 confirmed cases were reported from Lofa County. Two patients died; one of the deceased patients has been laboratory confirmed and the other death was in a probable case. Contact tracing is underway. Response activities in Liberia include a press conference by the Ministries of Health & Social Welfare and Ministry of Information, distribution of EVD prevention and control guidelines to health-care workers, training staff on case detection, contact tracing and follow up, clinical case management, infection prevention and control, specimen collection, handling and transportation and the safe handling of deceased patients. Staff from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and WHO have travelled to Lofa County to provide technical support and coordinate control efforts. Clinical specimens from suspected cases are being sent to the laboratory in Conakry, Guinea, for testing. Intensive community awareness raising campaigns are also underway through the mass media, via social mobilization activities and interpersonal communications, and involvement of telephone service providers in sending text messages. The Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone is maintaining a high level of vigilance following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. To date, active surveillance activities have identified no new suspected cases and all contacts of the deceased have remained well. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since most human infections result from direct contact with the body fluids or secretions of infected patients, particularly in hospitals (nosocomial transmission) and as a result of unsafe procedures, use of contaminated medical devices (including needles and syringes) and unprotected exposure to contaminated body fluids. Travellers should avoid all contact with infected patients. Those who are providing medical care or are involved in the evaluation of an outbreak should wear protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection and practice proper infection prevention and control and measures. Anyone who has stayed in the areas where EVD cases have been recently reported should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness. Clinicians managing returning travellers from visiting these areas with compatible symptoms are advised to take into consideration the possibility of EVD. Malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers are differential diagnosis to consider in these patients.

1291,"(' From July through September 2018, six cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 case in Jigawa and Katsina States, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from 18 July through 16 September 2018. This outbreak has also affected Jigawa, Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, and Borno states in Nigeria, with 17 cases reported since April 2018. Nigeria has also reported a separate cVDPV2 outbreak in Sokoto State that dates back to January 2018. Nigeria is one of only three countries in the world classified as endemic for wild poliovirus, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan. As part of the polio outbreak response in the Lake Chad Basin countries (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria) the last monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) round was implemented in Niger in January 2017. ### Public health response The outbreak response plan is being finalized to include the outbreak zone most at risk and the exact scale and extent of the response is being determined. * Two mOPV2 response vaccination campaigns will reach 3.2 million children under five years of age in four provinces in Niger (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi and Zinder). The first round took place from 24 through 27 October 2018 and the second is scheduled for 7 through 11 November 2018. * Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced. * WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. * Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded. * WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement. * WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health are working together to finalize the deployment of the human resources needed at national and provincial levels. ### WHO risk assessment The emergence of cVDPV2 in Niger is a reminder that until polio is eradicated, polio-free countries will remain at risk of polio re-infection or re- emergence. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. As this outbreak is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria, the risk of further international spread associated with this virus remains high. ### WHO advice It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement prevention measures, and speed-up the response if needed. Countries should also maintain high polio immunization coverage through routine vaccination to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction or emergence. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio- affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel. For travellers to Niger, IPV is recommended as it is effective against cVDPV2, whereas the type 2 component is no longer included in OPV. All countries should report any polio case using the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Countries affected by polio transmission should comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director General following advice from the IHR Emergency Committee concerning ongoing events and context involving transmission and international spread of poliovirus. These recommendations include that affected countries declare a national public health emergency, and encourage departing travellers to be vaccinated. ',)"
1267,"(' On 8 May 2018, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of two confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease occurring in Bikoro health zone, Equateur province. From 4 April through 9 May 2018, a total of 32 Ebola virus disease cases (among which two are confirmed, 18 probable and 12 suspected cases) were reported from Bikoro health zone, Equateur province, including 18 deaths. Three of the 32 cases were among healthcare workers. The patients presented with fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, myalgia and arthralgia, and some also showed haemorrhagic signs and symptoms. All cases were reported from the catchment area of the Ikoko-Impenge health facility, located 30 km from the central health zone office of Bikoro, which is 280 km by road from Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur province. Of the 21 initially reported cases on 8 May 2018, 17 had epidemiological links (potential contacts with another suspect case). Five samples were collected from hospitalized patients, three from Ikoko- Impenge and two from Bikoro. These were sent to Institute National de Recherche Biomédicale in Kinshasa on 7 May 2018, where the two samples from Ikoko-Impenge were found positive by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for Ebola virus on the same day. Over the last four decades, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced eight Ebola outbreaks. The most recent epidemic took place in May 2017 in the health zone of Likati, province of Bas-Uele. The ongoing epidemic is located in the Bikoro health zone, located in Equateur province, in western Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the border with the Republic of Congo. This is the fourth time that an Ebola outbreak has been reported in the former province of Equateur, following those of 1976, 1977 and 2014. However, this is the first time that the Bikoro health zone is facing an Ebola outbreak. The province of Equateur has an estimated population of 2.5 million people with 284 registered health facilities. Bikoro health zone has a population of around 163 000 people with three hospitals and 19 health centres covering the population, most with limited functionality. Medical supplies are provided by international bodies, but stock outs are frequent. ### Public health response * The Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo deployed Rapid Response Teams to investigate cases and deaths reported in Bikoro health zone in the Equateur province. * One million US dollars from the WHO contingency fund for emergencies have been mobilized. * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and Partners in the activation of multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response at all levels. * Médecins Sans Frontières is setting up a treatment centre for the management of cases in Bikoro health zone. * WHO has shared risk communication materials in French and Lingala with the WHO country offices. * Active surveillance activities among the community, the Ikoko-Impenge health centre team and Bikoro General Reference Hospital are being undertaken. * Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established. * Wellcome Trust is providing two million pounds sterling for the critical research needed to support the operational response which is now underway in the country. ### WHO risk assessment To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote area and appears to be geographically limited. However, in view of the available data, the overall risk is considered high at the national level due to the nature of the disease and the lack of epidemiological and demographic information to estimate the magnitude of the epidemic. The overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the proximity to the Congo river, which links with both the capitals of the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Information is currently limited and investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak. Based on the information currently available and the rapid response measures implemented by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and partners, the event does not meet the criteria of a public heath emergency of international concern as defined in the IHR (2005)1, and does not warrant the convening of an Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005). ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions of the international traffic in place. For more information on Ebola virus disease, please see the link below: * * * 1 “Public health emergency of international concern” means an extraordinary event which is determined, as provided in these Regulations: (i) to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and (ii) to potentially require a coordinated international response”.

On 23 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Benin declared the end of the outbreak. The announcement came 42 days after the detection of the last Lassa fever case in the country (10 April 2016). A total of 54 suspected cases, including 28 deaths, were reported from eight regions: Borgou (31 cases, 16 deaths), Donga (7 cases, 5 deaths), Collines (6 cases, 3 deaths), Alibori (3 cases, 1 death), Plateau (3 cases, 2 deaths), Ouémé (2 cases, 1 death), Atlantique (1 case) and Littoral (1 case). Of these 54 suspected cases, 16 were laboratory-confirmed in three regions: Borgou (13 cases), Donga (2 cases), Ouémé (1 case). Five of the 54 suspected cases are health workers from the Borgou region. Three of these 5 health workers were laboratory-confirmed. Two of these 5 health workers passed away. During the course of this outbreak, five laboratories provided technical support for the confirmation of Lassa fever cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR): * Lassa Fever Research and Control Centre, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua, Edo state, Nigeria; * Virology laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital Lagos, Nigeria; * Tropical medicine institute laboratory, Hamburg, Germany; * Noguchi laboratory (WHO Collaborating centre), Ghana; * Institut Pasteur (IP) Lyon, France. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health of Benin, with the support of WHO and partners, coordinated the management of the outbreak. Control measures were implemented, including field investigation, enhanced surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and follow-up, and social mobilization. WHO deployed a multidisciplinary team in the affected areas to support the response. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 739 contacts were identified and monitored. At present, 1 contact under follow-up was laboratory confirmed for Lassa fever infection. ### WHO risk assessment The current report confirms that, at present, there are no known Lassa fever transmission chains in Benin. Although Lassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries, this is only the second time that cases were reported in Benin (the first outbreak occurred in November 2014). This latest outbreak was characterized by a high number of deaths among confirmed cases. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to investigate the factors that contributed to this higher than expected mortality rate. Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood of flare-ups, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems. ### WHO advice WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available.

The national and district task forces continue to meet daily to coordinate the response to the outbreak. To date, 24 probable and confirmed cases including 16 deaths have been reported. 10 cases have been laboratory confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe. The most recent confirmed case was admitted in Kagadi isolation facility on 4 August 2012. Suspected cases which tested negative during the laboratory investigations have been discarded as Ebola patients, treated symptomatically for their ailments and discharged following recovery. A total of 43 people have been discharged from the isolation facility including one confirmed case. With the support of the psychosocial team, these 43 people have been counselled prior to discharge and reintegrated into the community. Even for the people who were negative for Ebola, psychosocial counselling of the communities to which they are returning, has been very important. It has allayed fears and reduced stigma, enabling them to be accepted back in the community. All contacts of probable and confirmed cases are followed up daily for 21 days and are monitored for any possible signs or symptoms of illness. All alerts of suspected cases in the other districts have been investigated and are negative for Ebola. In Kibaale district, the MoH is working in close coordination with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in clinical management of suspected and confirmed cases. Social mobilization teams comprising Red Cross volunteers and village health teams have reached most of the villages and households in the most affected sub-counties in Kibaale district. These activities are reinforced by the distribution of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials, and by the broadcast of health awareness messages on radio and by film vans. ### Neighbouring countries Countries sharing borders with Uganda are taking steps to enhance surveillance for Ebola; at the time of this update, none of them have reported any confirmed cases.

992,"(' 8 October 2012 - As of 7 October 2012, 49 cases (31 laboratory confirmed, 18 probable) with Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Of these, 24 have been fatal (10 confirmed, 14 probable). The cases reported are from Isiro and Viadana health zones in Haut-Uélé district in Province Orientale. The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to work with partners, under the National Task Force to identify all possible chains of transmission of the illness and ensure that appropriate measures are taken to interrupt transmission and stop the outbreak. The task force includes Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF); the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); US Agency for International Development (USAID); US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and WHO. Response operations continue in the areas of coordination; Infection Prevention and Control (IPC); surveillance and epidemiology; case management; public information and social mobilization; psychosocial support; anthropological analysis; and logistics. WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed experts to support operational response, including establishment of a field laboratory and in the area of infection prevention and control in health care settings. Initial samples were tested and confirmed by Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). CDC established a field laboratory in Isiro in the beginning of the outbreak and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is continuing to provide support on rapid diagnosis in the field with their mobile laboratory facilities in Isiro. Ongoing activities in Isiro and neighbouring areas include: training of health care workers on IPC in health care facilities, provision of support on case management, strengthening surveillance, working with traditional healers in raising awareness about EHF, providing psychosocial support to affected families, and conducting outreach to schools. With respect to this event, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to be applied to the DRC. ### General information on controlling infection of EHF in health-care settings Human-to-human transmission of the Ebola virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids. Transmission to healthcare workers has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus need to apply infection control measures to avoid any exposure to the patient’s blood and body fluids and/or direct unprotected contact with the possibly contaminated environment. In addition, it is important that Standard Precautions, particularly hand hygiene, the use of gloves and other personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and other measures are applied to all patients in all health care settings at all times.

1401,"(' 8 April 2005 As of 7 April, 205 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these, 180 have died. Zaire Province has reported its first 6 cases, bringing the number of affected provinces to seven, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country. Mobile surveillance teams in Uige were forced to suspend operations yesterday when vehicles were attacked and damaged by local residents. As the situation has not improved, no surveillance teams were operational today in this province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak. WHO staff in Uige were notified today of several fatalities but teams were unable to investigate the cause of death or collect the bodies for safe burial. Discussions have been held with provincial authorities to find urgent solutions. The dramatic symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and its frequent fatality are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by a lack of public understanding of the disease. Moreover, because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded. WHO is familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Two medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the public about the disease. In African countries, the single most important factor in controlling viral haemorrhagic fevers is the engagement of affected communities as partners in control. To achieve this engagement, local belief systems about the causes of disease and traditional rituals for mourning the dead must be respected. When the public understands and accepts a few simple messages – avoid contact with blood and other fluids when caring for the ill, don’t touch bodies of the deceased – transmission within the community can be stopped and the outbreak brought under control. International appeal Specialized international staff and equipment have been deployed rapidly and measures are beginning to have an impact. Control of the outbreak will require intensified and sustained technical support from multidisciplinary teams, and additional materials and supplies. Provision of adequate personal protective equipment is a particularly urgent need. Increased field coordination of technical, operational and logistic support is likewise needed. Today, WHO has launched an appeal, through the United Nations, for funding to support the emergency response to this outbreak. WHO needs US$ 2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health, Angola to intensify ongoing operations in the field. To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, priority activities include intensive social mobilization and health education in the towns and villages of Uige Province. To reduce the risk of transmission in health care facilities, priorities include the provision of personal protective equipment for front-line staff and essential supplies for infection control, including disinfectants. Additional activities that urgently need to be strengthened include the early detection and isolation of cases and the tracing and follow up of contacts. ',)"

To reduce the likelihood that those who are infected will carry the disease outside their communities, the governments have set up quarantine zones in areas of high transmission including severely-affected cities such as Gueckedou in Guinea, Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone and Foya in Liberia. This prevents people living in these areas from moving to other parts of the country and potentially increasing EVD transmission. However, it also means that barriers to travel limit their access to food and other necessities. While preventing further transmission of EVD is crucial, it is essential that people in those zones have access to food, water, good sanitation and other basic supplies. WHO is working with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure people in the quarantine zones receive regular food aid and other non-medical supplies. WFP is now scaling up its programme to distribute food to the around 1 million people living in the quarantine zones in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Food has been delivered to hospitalized patients and people under quarantine who are not able to leave their homes to purchase food. Providing regular food supplies is a potent means of limiting unnecessary movement. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.)

1296,"("" On 19 December 2018, the Argentinian Ministry of Health and Social Development issued an epidemiological alert regarding an increase in cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Epuyén, Chubut Province. Between 28 October 2018 – 20 January of 2019, a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS, including 11 deaths have been reported in Epuyén, Chubut Province. Epuyén has a population of approximately 2 000 persons, and Chubut Province is located in Patagonia in southern Argentina. The index case had environmental exposure prior to symptom onset on 2 November, and subsequently attended a party on 3 November. Six cases who also attended the party experienced the onset of symptoms between 20-27 November 2018. An additional 17 cases, all of whom were epidemiologically-linked to previously confirmed cases, experienced symptom onset between 7 December 2018 and 3 January 2019 (Figure 1). Potential human-to-human transmission is currently under investigation. Of the confirmed cases, 59% were female, and had an incubation period ranging from 8 to 31 days. Approximately 50% of these confirmed cases reported symptoms within the past three weeks. Cases were confirmed by ELISA IgM u-captura or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As of 17 January 2019, a total of 98 asymptomatic contacts have been identified and are being monitored for the potential development of symptoms. In Argentina, four endemic regions have been identified: North (Salta, Jujuy), Centro (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Ríos), Northeast (Misiones) and Sur (Neuquén, Río Negro, and Chubut). Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 100 confirmed cases were registered annually, with the provinces of Buenos Aires, Salta, and Jujuy having the highest numbers of cases. Between 2013 and 2018, 114 confirmed deaths from hantavirus were reported in Argentina, with a case- fatality rate of 18.6%, though this figure was close to 40% for some provinces in the southern region of the country. In Chile, one of the confirmed cases was a healthcare worker who resides in Palena Province, Los Lagos Region, and reported experiencing symptoms on 2 January 2019. The case had a travel history to Epuyén for one day in mid- November, and later hosted and cared for a confirmed case from Epuyén while she was in her prodromal phase. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in Los Lagos Region in 2019. During 2018, there were eight cases of hantavirus reported in Chile, including two deaths. #### Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of HPS by week of symptom onset in Epuyén, Chubut Province, Argentina. Source: Published by the Ministry of Health of Chubut Province and reproduced by PAHO/WHO ### Public health response Health authorities in Argentina and Chile are implementing the following public health measures: * Enhanced surveillance and active case finding including increase local diagnostic capacities for hantavirus for early diagnosis * Daily follow-up of contacts * Deployments of multi-disciplinary teams to the affected areas for outbreak investigation * Environmental control measures * Conduct risk communication activities; including educational awareness and health promotion in the communities and in healthcare facilities * Implementation of infection prevention and control measures * Safe case management of HPS patient in dedicated health care facilities ### WHO risk assessment HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic rodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to the virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one week and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can reach 35-50%. In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents, mainly Sigmodontinae species, transmission can occur when people come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human transmission of HPS due to Andes virus in Argentina has been previously documented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient isolation. Standard precautions1 should always be put in place, as well as rodent control measures. ### WHO advice PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus. Particular attention should be paid towards travelers returning from the affected areas. Early identification and timely medical care greatly improves clinical outcomes. To raise awareness regarding potential HPS cases, clinicians should consult epidemiological data for guidance of the possible exposure, and be vigilant of patients presenting with suspicious clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. Care during the initial stages of the disease should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad- spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICU). Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, is not approved for either treatment or prophylaxis of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infection. Health awareness campaigns must aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people’s exposure. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. Most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposure of travelers to rodents or their excreta. However, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking, should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials. HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. The implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations, is recommended. References: * * * 1 Standard precautions refer to a set of practices that are applied to the care of patients, regardless of the state of infection (suspicion or confirmation), in any place where health services are provided. These practices aim to protect both healthcare professionals and patients and include: hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, safe handling of sharps materials, safe injection practices, use of sterile instruments and equipment and cleaning of hospital environments and the environment.

617,"(' 25 August 2003 An outbreak of respiratory illness in an aged care facility in Canada has now been extensively investigated for SARS and WHO concludes the disease is not SARS. On 14 August, Canadian public health officials reported to WHO that an unidentified respiratory disease in a Surrey, British Columbia health care facility had infected 143 residents and staff. Some initial testing suggested the SARS coronavirus may have played a role. Now, WHO and Canadian health authorities have gathered enough evidence to conclude that the outbreak in British Columbia is not SARS. Analysis from laboratories in Canada and the United States did not confirm the initial concern that SARS had mutated into a milder disease. Two lines of evidence have converged to dismiss the SARS concern. Clinically, the disease itself was strikingly different from the SARS outbreak in the spring. The features of the current outbreak included a low case fatality, runny nose, lack of fever in most patients, and no SARS-like changes in the lung seen on X-ray. Now, sequencing of a portion of the virus causing the outbreak has led to the finding that it was not the SARS coronavirus but another human coronavirus known as OC43. This virus, which is one of the causes of the common cold, has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in aged care facilities in other countries. In terms of SARS, Canada continues to be a safe destination for travellers and travellers from Canada pose no exceptional risk to other countries.

New cases and deaths attributed to EVD continue to be reported from the three countries. Between 13 – 14 July 2014, 18 new cases and 11 deaths were reported from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The occurrence of community deaths, still being reported in Guinea, remains a serious concern. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and its partners to step up outbreak containment measures. ### Health sector response The national authorities in the three affected countries are scaling up outbreak containment measures. In Sierra Leone, the Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) aimed at ensuring effective coordination and accelerating implementation of the EVD outbreak response. The EOC is chaired by the Minister of Health and co-chaired by the WHO Representative for Sierra Leone, with members including heads of the different sub-committees of the task force, other senior staff, and key partners. The EOC will oversee the development of the prioritized operational plan in line with the Accra inter-country strategy, ensure that priority interventions are implemented as planned, and streamline communication and information flow. In Guinea, a high level political delegation comprised of the President of the National Assembly, the Ministers of Health and Communication, and senior government officials conducted a 3-day field visit to Guéckédou, from 14 – 17 July 2014. Outbreak response teams in Guéckédou, where community deaths continue to be reported, encountered resistance and apprehension from the communities. The delegation engaged local and opinion leaders in order to build a relationship of trust with the community, which should foster cooperation and enhance acceptance of outbreak control measures. As a result of this engagement and dialogue, leaders of 19 out of 23 villages pledged their commitment to embrace the EVD outbreak response. Meanwhile, leaders of the four villages that did not turn up for the meeting later made contacts with the local administrative authority, expressing their willingness to be part of the response. In addition, the national authority has established administrative and law enforcement mechanisms to deal with extreme instances of resistance, such as violence towards the response teams. In Liberia, the Chief Medical Officer including senior officials of the Ministry of Health, WHO, and other partners visited Foya district, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. The field visit aimed to streamline and strengthen implementation of outbreak containment measures. The delegation participated in the district task force meeting and held discussions with the district authority, partners and health care workers. Meanwhile, efforts are ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and so on. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 13 – 14 July 2014, 18 new cases of EVD, including 11 new deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 5 new cases and 6 deaths; Liberia, 2 new cases with 1 death; and Sierra Leone 11 new cases and 4 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 14 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 982, including 613 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 411 cases (301 confirmed, 95 probable, and 15 suspected) and 310 deaths (203 confirmed, 95 probable, and 12 suspected); Liberia, 174 cases (70 confirmed, 42 probable, and 62 suspected) and 106 deaths (51 confirmed, 34 probable, and 21 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 397 cases (346 confirmed, 39 probable, and 12 suspected) and 197 deaths (153 confirmed, 39 probable, and 5 suspected). ### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 14 July 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country Guinea Cases 5 301 95 15 411 Deaths 6 203 95 12 310 Liberia Cases 2 70 42 62 174 Deaths 1 51 34 21 106 Sierra Leone Cases 11 346 39 12 397 Deaths 4 153 39 5 197 Totals Cases 18 717 176 89 982 Deaths 11 407 169 38 613 1\\.

1081,"(' ### Guinea As of 18:00 on 12 May 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 248 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 171 deaths. Since the last update of 9 May 2014, there have been five new cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR and no new deaths among the confirmed cases. Reclassification of cases, retrospective investigation, and harmonization of data have brought the total number of confirmed cases to 138, including 92 deaths; 67 probable cases, 57 deaths (3 new probable deaths in the community); and 43 suspected cases (22 deaths). The geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is as follows: Conakry (50 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (163/119), Macenta (22/17), Kissidougou (8/6), Dabola (4/4), and Djinguiraye (1/1). The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (83/60); Macenta (12/10); Kissidougou (2/1); and Dabola (1/1). There have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 April, Macenta since 9 April, and Conakry since 26 April. In Djinguiraye and Dabola, no new cases have been reported since the end of March 2014. If no additional cases are identified in Conakry, the observation period for those individuals identified through contact tracing will end on 17 May. In Guekedou, the date of isolation of the most recent cases is 11 May 2014. A total of 480 contacts (5 in Conakry, 475 in Guekedou) are under follow up. The number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification and consolidation of cases and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities, and contact tracing activities. Introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases. ### Liberia and Sierra Leone There have been no new alerts in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia is preparing to host a cross-border meeting with Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone and surveillance activities have been enhanced in districts bordering Guinea. ### WHO response WHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities.

To date, 191 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 115 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 72 deaths. In addition, 42 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 61 cases (35 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-six (26) health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12 confirmed). Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (58 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (127/91), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (63/41), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). The date of onset of the most recent clinical case, a suspected case, is 23 April while the date of isolation of the most recent confirmed case is 22 April. Two new deaths have also been reported among existing cases; one of the deaths was a patient with confirmed EVD. Thirteen (13) patients are in isolation in Conakry (6 patients, 5 confirmed), Guekedou (7 patients, all confirmed). Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. Overall, the epidemiological situation in Guinea has improved significantly over the last few weeks. The date of onset of the last reported case from Macenta was 24 days ago and a similar time has elapsed for Dabola (25 days), Kissigougou (26) and Djingaraye (31 days). Two incubation periods (42 days) without cases is the standard for declaring an EVD outbreak over in a particular location. The focus of response activities at present includes clinical case management and ongoing training in hospital-based infection prevention and control (IPC). A documentary will be made on the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) isolation facility in Guekedou. WHO, in collaboration with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), has mobilized a new medical team comprising of IPC and intensive care physicians in support of the clinicians at the Donka Hospital in Conakry. The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, has arrived in Guinea to further strengthen diagnostic capacity for EVD by retesting patients who were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative by ebolavirus serology. The cross-border meeting on EVD response between the governments of Guinea and Liberia was successfully hosted by the Guinean government, attended by 25 participants from delegations from both countries. The overall objective of the meeting was to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and the follow up of contacts along the borders of the two countries in order to stop transmission of EVD. Key actions for implementation include: development of an action plan on the cross-border response to EVD; strengthening coordination of cross-border activities with engagement of local authorities; sharing information on the cross-border movement of suspected cases of EVD; reinforcing community awareness of EVD and ways to reduce personal and community risk of disease; and reinforcing active surveillance and contact tracing along the border as needed. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries. ### Liberia From 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 24 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a total of 35 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, 2 probable cases and 27 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April. The MOHSW has started to reclassify suspected cases against their laboratory test results. Most of the suspected cases are expected to be discarded at the end of this process. WHO, in collaboration with GOARN, is planning to replace experts who recently completed their missions in Liberia in the areas of case management, IPC and epidemiology. ### Sierra Leone The Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone is currently investigating 3 patients with an illness compatible with a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) for EVD and Lassa fever (the latter is endemic in Sierra Leone). All rumours of EVD cases are being investigated and active case finding is also ongoing. The laboratory at the Lassa Fever isolation facility at the Kenema Government Hospital is now analysing all suspected cases of VHF for both Lassa fever and EVD. As of 24 April 2014, 98 samples collected have been tested; 10 samples tested positive for Lassa fever and the remaining 88 tested negative for both diseases. Fifteen contacts have completed 21 days of follow up while 20 contacts remain under medical observation.

The most rapid increase in human cases has been seen in Gazeera State, which now accounts for more than half of the human cases. The cases being reported in Gazeera State are in an area close to irrigation canals and are linked to naturally occurring cycles involving livestock and mosquitoes which are abundant in the irrigation zone. On 11 November the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries reported to Office International des Epizooties (OIE) that Rift Valley Fever had been found on 29 October in samples taken from animals in White Nile State. It is anticipated that following this declaration, a well-integrated control program for limiting the disease in both human and animal populations will now be implemented. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has deployed a senior animal health expert to the country to assist veterinary services with prevention and control measures in animals. The Ministry of Health and WHO Country Office have presented a plan for the prevention and control of the disease in humans to international donors in Khartoum.

The following is the transcript of the English portion of the opening remarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the Environment and Food, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press briefing held on May 16: Precautionary measures taken to prevent spread of chicken disease I have called this press briefing to announce that at 3.30 this afternoon the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation has issued a notice declaring the poultry stalls in three markets as infected places in accordance with the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The three markets are Yeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the Smithfield Road Market. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has already started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has requested all poultry stallholders to destroy the live birds in their stalls, and these stallholders will be given every assistance and advice by members of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The department has also made appropriate arrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent right away to a landfill for proper treatment. After all the birds have been destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. We have taken this precautionary measure for two reasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763 chickens have died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other two markets. Tests by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have demonstrated that these chickens have died of avian influenza. I have to emphasize that there are many strains of H5N1 and according to the information currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain that we had in Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of H5N1 strains will not affect human beings. From samples we have recently collected from these three markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus, and genes sequencing tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I repeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong Kong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is essential for us to take this precautionary measure because there is a need to destroy these viruses thoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the probability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they might - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain which may affect human beings. I have to reiterate there is no cause for public concern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is that there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of course, the public is reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards. The measures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the results, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough surveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the arrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this surveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they arise so that we can take the necessary measures. Thank you very much. ',)"

1306,"In the Western Pacific Region (WPR), there has been a significant increase in reported measles cases between 2016 and 2017, with a 31% rise in cases. However, in 2018, there was a decrease in cases reported in WPR, with 26,163 cases reported compared to 11,118 in 2017. This resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO regions, with an unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas in WPR in 2019. Nine countries and areas in WPR have achieved measles elimination, but several countries and areas have reported outbreaks due to low immunization coverage and vaccine hesitancy. The WHO Regional Office for WPR is urging Member States to intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever, intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all cases, and ensure contingency resources are available for outbreak investigation and response immunization. The recent outbreaks have been fuelled by low immunization coverage, low immunization coverage among subpopulations, movement of people domestically and internationally, and vaccine hesitancy. Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing “zero-dose” to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread. * Update and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO’s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. WHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel restrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide how best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and communities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports, including on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful adjunct to raising measles awareness in the community. People planning international travel should ensure they have been vaccinated against measles because of the high risk of exposure to the measles virus from fellow travellers and in many countries in the world where measles is currently spreading. The current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to renew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures detailed in the “Measles Elimination Field Guide”1 and the “Regional Strategy and Plan of Action”2 to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the risk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission. * * * 1Measles Elimination Field Guide (WPR, 2013) 2Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific (WPR, 2018) 3The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (EURO, 2013) ',)"

Contact tracing in Guinea, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone has resulted in a range between 94% and 98% of contacts of EVD cases being identified and followed-up. In Liberia, efforts are underway to strengthen contact tracing, but help is needed in this area. The Liberian Army has also recently placed a third province under quarantine as part of the ongoing effort to stop transmission of EVD. ### Health sector response On 11 August, WHO convened a panel of medical ethicists, scientific experts, and lay people from the affected countries to consider and assess the ethical implications for clinical decision-making of the potential use of unregistered interventions. In the particular circumstances of this outbreak, and provided certain conditions are met, the panel reached consensus that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with as yet unknown efficacy and adverse effects, as potential treatment or prevention. Ethical criteria must guide the provision of such interventions. These include transparency about all aspects of care, informed consent, freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community.

These reported cases acquired the infection in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. In the continental part of the Netherlands, to date, 24 imported cases of Zika virus infection have been confirmed. All patients were diagnosed following a visit to Suriname or Aruba. All diagnoses were made by RT-PCR. ### Public health response Control measures have been implemented by local public health authorities in accordance with WHO guidelines in both Bonaire and Aruba. Because of this imminent epidemic, during the past months, local authorities have intensified mosquito control programs. ### WHO risk assessment The detection of autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection indicates that the virus is spreading geographically to previously unaffected areas (Bonaire and Aruba). The notification of autochthonous transmission in a new country does not change the overall risk assessment. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Despite some reports of a potential association between Zika virus, microcephaly and other neurological disorders, at this stage, it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between these events. Until more is understood, Members States are advised to standardize and enhance surveillance for microcephaly and other neurological disorders, particularly in areas of known Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such transmission. ### WHO advice The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to countries or territories within the Kingdom of the Netherlands based on the current information available. ',)"
889,"("" 26 December 2008 - As of 25 December 2008, a total of 26 497 cases, including 1 518 deaths, have been reported by the Ministry of Health in Zimbabwe. Cases are now being reported from all 10 of the country's provinces. Harare, particularly Budiriro suburb in the south west, accounts for the majority of cases, followed by Beitbridge in Matabeleland South and Mudzi in Mashonaland East. The current outbreak is the largest ever recorded in Zimbabwe and is not yet under control. In fact, the epidemiological week ending 20 December saw over 5 000 new cases - an increase in the number of weekly cases relative to previous weeks - and an increase in deaths outside treatment/health centres. The overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has risen to 5.7% - far above the 1% which is normal in large outbreaks - and in some rural areas it has reached as high as 50%. Mortality outside of healthcare facilities remains very high. This is a clear indication that better case management and access to healthcare is needed - in particular an increased use of oral rehydration therapy with Oral Rehydration Salts in communities very early after onset of the disease. The outbreak has taken on a subregional dimension with cases being reported from neighboring countries. In South Africa as of 26 December, 1 279 cumulative cases and 12 deaths (CFR of 0.9%) had been recorded, with the bulk of the cases (1 194) in the Limpopo area. Cases have also been reported in Botswana (Palm Tree). The current situation is closely linked to the lack of safe drinking water, poor sanitation, declining health infrastructure, and reduced numbers of healthcare staff reporting to work. Other current risk factors include the commencement of the rainy season and the movement of people within the country, and possibly across borders, during the Christmas season. WHO, together with the Ministry of Health and partners from the health and Water and Sanitation clusters, has established a cholera outbreak response coordination unit in order to strengthen the reporting and early detection of cases, improve the response mechanism and access to healthcare and ensure proper case management. WHO has also deployed experts in public health, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization. In light of the extent and pace of expansion of the outbreak, reinforcing all control activities across the country is critical. Given the current dynamic of the outbreak and the context of the collapsed health system, a cholera vaccination is not recommended. Moreover, the use of the internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated to its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the occurrence of severe adverse events. In controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. However, neighboring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.

This is the largest number of fatalities ever recorded during an outbreak of this rare, but extremely severe disease. Mobile surveillance teams have been established and are investigating rumours of additional cases in Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak. A mobile field laboratory provided by the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory arrived yesterday, was set up in Uige today, and will become operational tomorrow. A dedicated isolation facility, operated by Médecins sans Frontières, is preparing to receive further cases that may be identified by the mobile surveillance teams. Additional staff from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and WHO will be arriving over the weekend. Two logisticians will join teams in Uige and Luanda. A data manager, media coordinator, and medical anthropologist will also be arriving over the weekend. WHO has despatched a further 500 kg of personal protective equipment and other supplies to assist in the immediate improvement of infection control in hospitals and the protection of front-line staff.

1139,"(' ### Epidemiology and surveillance Between 31 July and 1 August 2014, a total of 163 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD; laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 61 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Three of these cases are in Nigeria and include two new probable cases — one is a health-care worker and one is a Nigerian who travelled to Guinea — and a suspected case in a nurse. National authorities in Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo continue to work closely with WHO and its partners in identification of contacts and contact tracing as well as in preparing response plans as a result of the recent visit by and death of a Liberian national to Nigeria from EVD and the new Nigerian EVD probable case, who travelled to Guinea. ### Health sector response The Director-General of the World Health Organization visited Guinea and held high-level meetings with the Presidents of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to review the status of the Ebola epidemic and adopt common strategies to eradicate Ebola from the sub-region. A Joint Declaration of Heads of State and Government of the Mano River Union (comprised of Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) was issued and leaders pledged to commit additional resources to the outbreak. This will include the following measures: * Actions at the inter-country level to focus on cross-border regions, including isolation of specific areas by police and military and material support to the citizens in these areas. Health-care centers in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing, and contact tracing. Burials will be done in accordance with national health regulations. * Provision of incentives, treatment, and protection for health personnel so they can feel safe in their jobs and perform their duties. In addition, security for national and international personnel supporting the fight against Ebola will also be assured. * A commitment by Heads of State to do their part to bring the outbreak to an end as soon as possible. To this end, the international community will support affected countries to build capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, case management, and laboratory capacity. * Mobilization of the private and public sectors to work in synergy and increase sensitization efforts to enable communities to understand EVD for effective and efficient eradication. * Involve all sectors in immediate implementation of necessary interventions outlined in national response plans; harmonize and coordinate these measures; deploy national and international human resources with appropriate skills; mobilize and allocate appropriate financial resources; strengthen surveillance of cross-border movement. * Improve information and communications systems in an effort to strengthen sensitization and promote community participation, taking into account cultural contexts. * Improve infection prevention and control measures in all treatment centres to prevent health personnel from contracting and dying from EVD. * Put in place a monitoring and evaluation system of regional strategies and conduct research around the disease. Human and financial resource mobilization continues to be sought from WHO’s partners, UN agencies, and other stakeholders. On Friday, WHO and the affected countries issued the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan in West Africa covering Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, neighbouring states, and other countries in the region from July-December 2014. (http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/outbreak-response-plan/en/). The joint WHO- tri-national plan, estimated at US$ 100.5 million (funding gap is US$ 71 million) calls for additional human and material resources that align with the measures in the Joint Declaration. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the four West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

The most affected area is Kabul province, Central region where nearly 7 000 cases have occurred. Out of 9 samples tested, 5 were laboratory-confirmed as cholera. A significant increase in the number of suspect cholera cases was noted in Kunduz province, North-eastern region and various provinces in Southern region during the week 3 to 9 July. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) organized a cholera task force including representatives of the MOPH, WHO, UNICEF, Médecins sans frontières and Save the Children Fund (US). Data collection from hospitals and other health centres was organized in Kabul city. WHO distributed drug supplies through its suboffices in the regions and arrangements are being made to procure more supplies. Regions where no cholera cases have been reported have been alerted and task forces formed within the diarrhoeal disease surveillance system. Discussions were held with the MOPH, UNICEF and the World Food Programme in Kabul to prepare the implementation of control activities including chlorination of wells, mass awareness campaigns and construction and installation of microfilters for the provision of safe drinking-water at public places in Kabul city.

New cases and deaths attributed to EVD continue to be reported from the three countries. Between 13 – 14 July 2014, 18 new cases and 11 deaths were reported from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The occurrence of community deaths, still being reported in Guinea, remains a serious concern. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and its partners to step up outbreak containment measures. ### Health sector response The national authorities in the three affected countries are scaling up outbreak containment measures. In Sierra Leone, the Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) aimed at ensuring effective coordination and accelerating implementation of the EVD outbreak response. The EOC is chaired by the Minister of Health and co-chaired by the WHO Representative for Sierra Leone, with members including heads of the different sub-committees of the task force, other senior staff, and key partners. The EOC will oversee the development of the prioritized operational plan in line with the Accra inter-country strategy, ensure that priority interventions are implemented as planned, and streamline communication and information flow. In Guinea, a high level political delegation comprised of the President of the National Assembly, the Ministers of Health and Communication, and senior government officials conducted a 3-day field visit to Guéckédou, from 14 – 17 July 2014. Outbreak response teams in Guéckédou, where community deaths continue to be reported, encountered resistance and apprehension from the communities. The delegation engaged local and opinion leaders in order to build a relationship of trust with the community, which should foster cooperation and enhance acceptance of outbreak control measures. As a result of this engagement and dialogue, leaders of 19 out of 23 villages pledged their commitment to embrace the EVD outbreak response. Meanwhile, leaders of the four villages that did not turn up for the meeting later made contacts with the local administrative authority, expressing their willingness to be part of the response. In addition, the national authority has established administrative and law enforcement mechanisms to deal with extreme instances of resistance, such as violence towards the response teams. In Liberia, the Chief Medical Officer including senior officials of the Ministry of Health, WHO, and other partners visited Foya district, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. The field visit aimed to streamline and strengthen implementation of outbreak containment measures. The delegation participated in the district task force meeting and held discussions with the district authority, partners and health care workers. Meanwhile, efforts are ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and so on. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

1210,"(' On 24 November 2015, health authorities in French Polynesia reported unknown and unspecified causes of morbidity and mortality in the context of concomitant outbreaks of Zika and dengue (serotypes 1 and 3) viruses. This update provides additional information on the clinical findings as well as the epidemiological and laboratory investigations of these cases. Between October 2013 and April 2014, French Polynesia experienced the largest Zika virus outbreak ever recorded in the country. During this period of time, 32,000 patients (11.5% of the population) were assessed for the infection and 8,750 suspected cases were reported by the national surveillance system. Of the suspected cases, 383 were later laboratory-confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). During the Zika virus outbreak, 42 patients were admitted to hospital with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This represents a 20-fold increase in incidence of GBS in French Polynesia compared with the previous four years. Of the 42 patients, 16 (38%) required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 12 (29%) received mechanical ventilation. The duration of hospital stay for patients that were not admitted to ICU ranged between 7 to 20 days (median=11). The duration of hospital stay for patients that were admitted to intensive care went from 16 to 70 days (median=51). No deaths were reported. The majority of these cases (88%) reported symptomatic Zika virus infection in the days (median=6) that preceded the onset of neurological symptoms. Further investigations were carried out to identify the potential role of previous infections known to be associated, or potentially associated, with GBS. The investigations carried out by the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire- Direction de la Santé de Polynésie Française showed that 41 of the 42 cases of GBS (98%) had IgM or IgG antibodies against Zika virus; furthermore, all GBS cases (100%) had positive seroneutralisation against Zika virus. Results for the matched non-febrile illness control group were significantly different: elevated IgM or IgG antibodies were detected in 35 of the 98 control patients (36%); additionally, neutralising antibodies against Zika virus were detected in 54 control patients (56%). Analysis of dengue serology (immunofluorescent assay, microsphere immunoassay, and seroneutralisation) did not support recent dengue infection, even though most cases (95%) had pre-existing dengue immunity. Other known causes of GBS were investigated and excluded, including Campylobacter jejuni, Cytomegalovirus, HIV, Epstein–Barr and Herpes simplex viruses. ### WHO risk assessment This is the first report of a large number of patients who developed GBS after contracting Zika virus. The study provides strong evidence of a possible causal relationship between Zika virus infection and GBS. Since all 42 cases had serological tests suggesting successive dengue and Zika virus infections, this association might be a predisposing factor for developing GBS. Further investigations are needed to understand the implications of pre-existing dengue infections, together with recent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis of GBS. Similarly to French Polynesia, it is likely that countries that are currently reporting autochthonous Zika virus transmission will face a rise in the number of GBS cases in the coming months. A number of countries in Latin America have already started to report an increase in the incidence of GBS while experiencing a rise in the cases of Zika virus infection. Nevertheless, it is critical to ensure that in all these countries, the reported increases in the incidence of GBS are the result of a real change rather than enhanced surveillance. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO recommends Member States affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks to: * monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values; * develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome; * raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors.

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened the Emergency Committee for a meeting on 12 April, to consider whether the current EVD outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to provide recommendations. Progress on the ground this week focused primarily on intensifying infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in and around outbreak hotspot areas. IPC teams are concentrating their efforts at addressing reluctance to decontamination activities amongst some local residents by actively engaging in regular direct dialogues with community leaders. Along with intensifying decontamination efforts, other IPC measures being undertaken include rapid evaluation of IPC practices in healthcare facilities and patients’ homes and identifying facilities at increased risk of contact with EVD cases. Results from these rapid evaluations demonstrated a range of IPC gaps depending on the type of facility, which were then promptly addressed through supplementary supervision. Reoccurring issues include limited knowledge of standard precautions, lack of triage and isolation capacity, insufficient supplies (e.g., of personal protective equipment), inappropriate waste management, and lack of capacity for decontaminating medical equipment. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining supportive supervision and mentorship at priority facilities throughout the response. WHO is confident that strengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the spread of EVD in the outbreak areas. WHO and partners in Risk Communication and Community Engagement are continuing with activities to build and maintain a trusting relationship between communities and the Ebola response teams. Dialogues with community committees are ongoing in the hotspot areas of Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi, and form a key part of a larger increase ownership of the Ebola response by the communities. Information about community disquiet are systematically collected and monitored to ensure that any misunderstanding leading to reluctance, refusal, or resistance of the Ebola response is followed up with and resolved as quickly as possible. This has been made possible by feedback from the community members, received through ongoing dialogue and various research activities within both the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring areas. In an effort to address the feedback received and specific concerns over the outbreak response, guided visits of the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) in various affected areas have been organized. Students and community associations who attended these guided visits to the ETCs can see first-hand how EVD patients are treated and help stop the potential dissemination of misinformation surrounding EVD and the ongoing response efforts. The security situation has remained calm for the past week as well. Provisional results released on 9 April by the Commission Électorale Nationale Indépendante concerning the national and provincial legislative elections in Beni, Butembo city (North Kivu), and Yumbi territory (Mai-Ndombe) have caused no significant unrest or disruption to outbreak response activities. The continued increase in cases this past week reflects the complex reality of conducting an effective outbreak response in a geographically difficult area with a highly fluid population, intermittent attacks by armed groups, and limited healthcare infrastructure. Despite these challenges, WHO and partners remain committed to limiting the spread of EVD amongst these vulnerable populations through the continued strengthening of our multi-faceted response efforts. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 9 April 2019* *Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. #### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 9 April 2019 ### Table 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 9 April 2019** **Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health. ### Public health response For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: ### WHO risk assessment WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity. ### WHO advice International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

1208,"("" On 25 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Benin notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever. The outbreak was initially detected on 21 January following reports of unexplained fever within a cluster of health workers from the district of Tchaourou, Borgou department. On 3 January, these health workers provided care to a patient suffering from haemorrhagic fever. Between 21 January and 16 February, 71 cases (6 confirmed, 10 probable et 55 suspected) were reported from seven departments – namely, Borgou (52), Collines (13), Ouémé (2), Alibori (1), Atlantique (1), Kouffo (1) and Littoral (1). During the same period of time, a total of 23 deaths were recorded in the departments of Borgou (16), Collines (4), Atlantique (1), Ouémé (1) and Plateau. Seven of the reported cases (3 confirmed, 1 probable and 3 suspected), including 2 deaths (1 confirmed and 1 probable), were health workers. To date, 6 cases, including 2 deaths, have been laboratory confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Virology Unit, Central Research Laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. ### Public health response The Ministry of Health of Benin, with the support of WHO and partners, is coordinating the management of the outbreak. Control measures are being implemented, including field investigation, enhanced surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and follow-up, and social mobilization. WHO has deployed a multidisciplinary team in the affected areas to support the response. WHO's Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) has deployed two experts and has provided financial support to the country. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 318 contacts have been identified and 292 are currently under follow-up. ### WHO risk assessment Lassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries. The disease causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of Benin, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. Although, this is only the second Lassa outbreak reported in Benin, the outbreak is occurring during known seasonal patterns. According to available information, its characteristics are similar to other outbreaks described elsewhere; however, considering seasonal case flare-ups during this time of the year, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems. WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available. ### Background Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness with an incubation period of 1-4 weeks and is endemic in West Africa. The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevent and control measures. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin (where it was diagnosed for the first time in November 2014), Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%. Observed case-fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa fever is 15%. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. "",)"

Of these reported cases, Vibrio cholerae has been laboratory confirmed in 283 stool specimens. During the period from 29 July to 2 September 2007, the health authority of Kirkuk Governate reported a total of 3,728 cases of acute diarrhoeal disease including 1 death (CFR: 0.03%). The first index case of cholera, confirmed by laboratory test, was reported from Kirkuk Governate on 14 August 2007. Most recently, six laboratory-confirmed cases of cholera were reported from Erbil Governate. The Government of Iraq has mobilised a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. A high-level National Committee on Cholera Preparedness and Outbreak Response has been established. The provincial health authorities of Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk and Erbil Governates have initiated a number of public health control measures to contain the outbreak, including risk assessment, improving water safety and sanitation, strengthening the surveillance system for diarrhoeal disease, improving coordination and information flow, standardising clinical case management, mobilising medical and other essential supplies, and implementing social mobilisation and health education campaigns. All public water supply systems in the affected districts have been chlorinated by the provincial authorities. In addition, water samples from the public water supply sources are being collected and tested routinely to ensure they meet potable water safety standards. WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a number of non-governmental organisations including the International Medical Corps (IMC), and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF - France) are supporting the Ministry of Health and local health authorities in ongoing response operations. In controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. ### For more information ',)"

45,"(' 21 March 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported The UK has analyzed cases of CJD that have occurred in 10 adults below 42 years of age during the past year. The disease in these cases differs from classical CJD in several respects: * early age (CJD is usually a disease of older people) * differences in pathological changes in the brain * absence of any hereditary factors (which are involved in typical CJD) There is no direct evidence of a link between these cases and bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE). However, in the absence of any apparent cause, the most likely explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before control measures were instituted in the UK in 1989. The measures now in force in the UK are considered to have minimized any possible risk from eating beef. No similar pattern of disease has been recognized in humans in any other country although BSE has also occurred in animals in Ireland, France, Portugal, and Switzerland. Precautions have been taken in these countries to avoid any possible risk to people from beef consumption.

1054,"(' 2 April 2014 - As at 1 April 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 127 clinically compatible cases of EVD, of which 35 are laboratory confirmed by PCR. The total number includes 83 deaths (CRF 65%). These figures correspond to 5 new clinical cases and 3 new deaths since the last update on 31 March; 22 patients remain in isolation. The current number of clinical cases by place of report is Conakry (12 cases, including 4 deaths), Guekedou (79 cases/57 deaths), Macenta (23 cases/14 deaths), Kissidougou (9 cases/5 deaths), and Dabola and Djingaraye combined (4 cases/3 deaths). Eleven of the cases in Conakry have been laboratory confirmed for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Fourteen health care workers have also been laboratory confirmed for EVD, 8 of whom have died. Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 375 contacts under medical follow-up at present. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported that the number of suspected and confirmed cases (8 cases) is unchanged since 31 March, with the exception of one additional death in this group (5 deaths). The number of laboratory confirmed cases remains at 2; both patients are from Lofa County, one of whom has died. On 31 March, the MOHSW issued a press release reporting that one of the laboratory confirmed cases travelled from Foyah, Lofa Country, to Monrovia, Montserrado Country, and also to Margibi County. She is currently in isolation and her contacts, including the taxi driver who transported her from Foyah to Monrovia and his family, are under medical observation. A national team headed by the Chief Medical Officer of Liberia visited Lofa County on 1 April to hold meetings with local government officials and other stakeholders in Voinjama and Foyah cities. Information and education materials on the EVD and its prevention have been distributed and national information hotlines have been established for public inquiries. Other ongoing efforts include coordination meeting at national and county levels, distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals in Montserrado, deployment of response teams to Nimba and Bong Counties to support county efforts, clinician training in case identification, clinical management and infection prevention and control, and social mobilisation to raise community awareness about the disease, the risk of ebolavirus transmission from human and animal sources, and its prevention including the importance of hand washing, food safety, personal protection when caring for the sick, safe burial practices and environmental hygiene. There has been no change in the situation in Sierra Leone following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ',)"

678,"(' 29 April 2004 The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported diagnostic confirmation of SARS infection in two patients previously under investigation in Beijing. Confirmation is based on the results of laboratory tests, clinical symptoms, and a history of close contact with a known case. Both patients are relatives – the mother and an aunt – of a 20-year-old nurse who treated what is thought to be the index case in the outbreak. The nurse subsequently developed respiratory symptoms and was hospitalized on 7 April. She was visited the next day by family members, including the mother and aunt. The 44-year-old mother is now in critical condition. The 36-year-old aunt, who was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia earlier this week, remains in stable condition. Both patients are part of a third generation of cases that includes the nurse’s father and two other patients hospitalized on the same ward, including one patient who shared a room with the nurse. The number of SARS cases either clinically confirmed or under investigation remains nine: seven in Beijing and two (including the single fatality) in Anhui Province. In Beijing, all seven SARS cases are now being treated in isolation at Ditan Hospital. This is a risk reduction strategy aimed at preventing further spread through the hospital system. According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS, classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires independent verification of results by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public health. ',)"

Initial tests on the 3 other samples were negative, but other tests are still in progress. The availability of samples from the 2 other cases is not known at this time. Since November 1999, there have been 30 notifications of possible Marburg disease from the vicinity of Durba. Twelve of these were negative after extensive laboratory tests, [see Update 9] leaving a current total of 18 cases: 11 of which are confirmed, and 7 of which are currently classified as suspect cases because no sample was available (2), the status of samples is unknown (2), or results are pending (3).

737,"("" 6 April 2005 As of 5 April, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 181 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these, 156 have died. Cases have now been reported from five provinces. Uige remains the epicentre of the outbreak. While children under the age of 5 years initially accounted for around 75% of cases, recent cases are including an increasing number of adults. One person is currently under investigation for Marburg haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Assessment of the outbreak WHO is concerned about the further evolution of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola, and this concern is fully shared by the government. Following confirmation of Marburg virus as the causative agent, on 21 March, WHO sent its senior epidemiologists to Uige to assess the situation and organize an initial emergency response. That assessment prompted a rapid and massive augmentation of support in the form of international teams of specialized staff, presently in Uige and Luanda, and several shipments of supplies. Staff have been drawn from WHO and its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Equipment to strengthen local diagnostic and communication capacity is also now in place. This escalation of support is continuing, with the government making great efforts to facilitate the rapid influx of staff and supplies and set up the basic infrastructure for a sustained emergency response. WHO has acquired extensive experience in the successful control of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, a closely-related disease that is clinically almost identical. Based on this experience, WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be brought under control. At the same time, however, the implementation of effective control measures faces several significant challenges, some of which may be unique to this outbreak. Marburg haemorrhagic fever is an extremely rare disease that remains poorly understood. Information on the behaviour of Marburg virus once it enters a human population is sparse. As detailed in a fact sheet recently issued by WHO, the outbreak in Angola is one of only two large outbreaks of this disease that have occurred in indigenous African populations since the virus was first detected in 1967. The only other large outbreak, which began in late 1998 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was confined to two sparsely populated villages in an isolated corner of the country, caused sporadic cases with small chains of transmission over two years, and never reached the intensity of transmission seen in just the past few weeks in Angola. The outbreak in Angola is not only the largest on record, with the highest fatality, but is also the first to occur in an urban setting. Almost three decades of civil unrest have left Angola with a severely weakened health infrastructure, a hospital system in dire need of basic equipment and supplies, inadequate communication and transportation systems, and a population weakened by economic hardship. These weaknesses hamper containment efforts, which depend on active surveillance for cases, rapid detection and isolation in specially designated and equipped facilities, and rapid tracing of contacts. Based on experiences with Ebola, control measures can have an immediate impact by interrupting chains of transmission. The eventual success of such measures depends on their sustained application, supported by efficient surveillance, and requires very good communication and transportation systems. Such systems are not presently available in Angola and cannot be established quickly. As another consequence of the country’s recent history, hundreds of thousands of landmines are thought to remain in the country, making transportation by rail and road precarious and necessitating air transport of staff and equipment. Intensified surveillance in Uige over the past few days has determined that some patients are not being hospitalized and are dying within the community, creating an urgent need to organize services for the safe collection and burial of deceased persons. Cases in health care workers point to the need to greatly increase supplies of protective equipment for front-line workers, particularly in hard-hit Uige and densely populated Luanda. WHO has arranged three shipments of this equipment to date; more shipments are on their way. Personal protective equipment is also being supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Médecins sans Frontières, and UNICEF. Nonetheless, supplies still fall short of the need. The symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and its rapid fatality in the majority of cases, can cause great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety increases the risk that people in affected areas may flee to other areas, thus fanning wider spread. Moreover, control measures are socially disruptive and may further increase public unease. In Uige, there is some evidence of a reluctance to seek treatment or remain under care in hospitals. Efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the hospital system, restore public confidence, and thus improve compliance with control measures. Numerous alerts are now being received each day, and teams from the Ministry of Health and WHO are being rapidly deployed to conduct investigations. Outcomes are reported daily by radio, and information about the evolution of the outbreak is improving. The incubation period of this disease, which can be as short as 3 days, necessitates rapid and efficient contact tracing, and this has been made a priority. Good tracing and management of contacts helps to ensure that possible cases are isolated prior to the onset of symptoms, when the risk of transmission to others is highest. Other current priorities include the protection of front-line staff, strengthening of infection control in designated isolation wards, improved transportation of suspected cases to these wards, and public education to encourage protective behaviours and improve compliance with control measures. In addition to these fundamental tasks, a top priority at present is to prevent the virus from establishing a foothold in densely populated urban or peri-urban parts of the country. For example, Uige, which is presently the epicentre of the outbreak, has around 500,000 inhabitants, but Luanda, where some cases have been reported, has a population close to 3 million. Response capacity in Luanda is being strengthened by the Ministry of Health, and WHO is increasing the number of international staff there as a support. International collaboration Over the past two weeks, WHO has provided support to the Ministry of Health from Headquarters, the Regional Office for Africa, and Country Offices in Angola and in Mozambique.

1280,"(' As 42 days (two incubation periods) have passed since the last possible exposure to a confirmed Ebola virus disease case, on 24 July 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga announced the end of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, commends the country and partners in the response against the outbreak while urging them to extend this success to combatting other diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In contrast to previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks in the country, this outbreak involved three health zones, including an urban centre with river connections to the capital and to neighbouring countries, as well as remote rainforest villages. Within hours of the outbreak being declared on 8 May 2018, WHO advanced more than US$2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, deployed a team to augment capacity in the field, and activated an emergency incident management system. More than two-thirds of the 360 people deployed to respond came from within the WHO African Region, including vaccination teams from Guinea. From 20 through 21 July 2018, WHO supported a workshop to harmonize, reconcile and validate the wide range of data arising from the outbreak response. The workshop brought together teams responsible for coordination, surveillance, case management, laboratory investigations and vaccinations in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Itipo, Iboko and Kinshasa to share their findings, and harmonize data records. As a result of this exercise, changes to the number of confirmed and probable cases, including deaths among these cases, were agreed. These changes only affected the reclassification of data records of past cases, who were otherwise known to field investigators and received full follow-up as part of the response. As of 24 July 2018, a total of 54 Ebola virus disease cases (38 confirmed and 16 probable) were reported, with illness onset between 5 April and 2 June 2018 (Figure 1). Of these cases, 33 died (overall case fatality ratio: 61%), including 17 deaths among confirmed cases. Cases were reported from three health zones (Figure 2): Bikoro (n=21; 10 confirmed, 11 probable), Iboko (n=29; 24 confirmed, 5 probable), and Wangata (n=4; all confirmed). Seven cases were health care workers, of whom two died. #### Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by epidemiological week of illness onset, Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 5 April through 24 July 2018 (n=54) #### Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 5 April through 24 July 2018 (n=54) ### Public health response From 3 through 5 July 2018, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, conducted a strategic operations review to assess the current epidemiological situation, evaluate progress against the Ebola virus disease Strategic Response Plan, engage in initial lesson learning, and prioritize key activities and resources for continued vigilance in affected areas. A key product of the operations review was the development of a government-led Consolidation and Stabilization Plan (August – October 2018) to transition resources deployed, strengthen emergency response capacity and preparedness, and overall resilience of the health systems. This plan includes: * Maintaining and strengthening surveillance capacity to rapidly detect and respond to potential new cases of Ebola virus disease, including for points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and in neighbouring provinces and countries; * Strengthening infection prevention and control, as well as Water, Sanitation, and Health (WASH), in targeted health facilities; * Maintaining evidence-based standards for case management (clinical care of patients and access to monitored use of investigational therapeutics); * Maintaining local laboratory capacity for confirmation of new potential cases and management of care to survivors; * Providing health services and psychosocial care for survivors and their families; * Strengthening community engagement to improve knowledge of and response to Ebola and epidemic-prone diseases in targeted health zones; * Improving food security in health zones affected by Ebola virus disease; * Leveraging resources and knowledge from the first two phases of the response to facilitate the development of a National Health Security and Resilience Plan, based on previous assessments and the after action review which is planned from 10 through 14 September 2018. As part of this next phase of the public health response, WHO will support the Ministry of Health in leading an After-Action Review with partners and donors to engage in lessons learning and determine how best to leverage resources and knowledge from the first two phases of the response to strengthen health systems and national resilience under a National Action Plan for Heath Security. ### WHO risk assessment The latest WHO assessment concluded that the current Ebola virus disease outbreak has been contained, considering that 42 days (two maximum incubation periods) have elapsed since the date of the second negative test of the last case confirmed case on 12 June 2018. Under the Consolidation and Stabilisation Strategic Plan adopted by the Ministry for Health, enhanced surveillance, a program for long-term Ebola survivor care and other response mechanisms, remain in place following the end of the outbreak declaration to maintain increased vigilance and contribute to resilience of the health system. WHO considers the public health risk associated with the recent Ebola virus disease outbreak to be low at national, regional and global levels. Ebola virus disease is, however, endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and may re-emerge at any time. ### WHO advice WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce Ebola virus disease transmission: * Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption. * Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home. * Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission, based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for Ebola virus. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available evidence. WHO has monitored travel and trade restrictions during this outbreak, and recorded 26 countries that put in place entry screening measures, while no country has implemented any travel or trade restrictions, as recommended by the Emergency Committee.

1219,"(' Between August 2015 and 17 May 2016, WHO has been notified of 273 cases of Lassa fever, including 149 deaths in Nigeria. Of these, 165 cases and 89 deaths have been confirmed through laboratory testing (CFR: 53.9%). The cases were reported from 23 states in Nigeria. Since August 2015, ten health care workers (HCW) have been infected with Lassa fever virus, of which two have died. Of these ten cases, four were nosocomial infections. As of 17 May 2016, 8 states are currently reporting Lassa fever cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed), deaths and/or following of contacts for the maximum 21-day incubation period. Currently, 248 contacts are being followed up in the country. The other 15 previously affected states have completed the 42-day period following last known possible transmission. ### Public health response Currently, two national laboratories are supporting the laboratory confirmation of Lassa fever cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. All the samples were also tested for Ebola, Dengue, Yellow fever and so far have tested negative. The two laboratories that are currently operational are: * Virology laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital * Lassa fever research and control centre, Irrua specialist hospital Along with other key partners, WHO is supporting ministry of health in surveillance and response of Lassa fever outbreaks including contacts tracing, follow up and community mobilization. One of a concern since the onset of Lassa fever outbreaks is the high proportion of deaths among the cases that is still under investigation. ### WHO Risk Assessment Overall, the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend. Considering the seasonal peaks in previous years, improvements in community and health care worker awareness, preparedness and general response activities, the risk of a larger-scale outbreak is low. Nevertheless, close monitoring, active case search, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (both in community in general and specific training for health care workers) should continue. ### WHO Advice Considering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures). Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions. The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the current information available. ',)"
549,"(' 22 May 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported In collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Afghanistan and nongovernmental organizations including Health Net International (HNI) and TODAI, WHO has recently carried out an evaluation of the situation regarding cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Kabul. The situation in Kabul appears to be particularly severe, with an estimated 200 000 cases of CL. Although CL is not a lethal disease, it carries a high burden of social stigma. Movements of populations both within the country and across borders due to the consequences of ongoing conflicts are expected to increase the incidence of the disease within the coming months. CL has been endemic in Afghanistan for several years, with foci of zoonotic (animal reservoir to man) transmission mainly in the northern provinces and with anthroponotic transmission (human to human) typically involving large cities. An emergency plan of action is being developed by WHO and other partners to control the situation by the end of 2003, at least in Kabul. Priority interventions include provision of impregnated bednets, early treatment of cases with first line drugs, recruitment and training of intervention teams, and health education. WHO has already provided drugs for the treatment of 35 000 cases. In collaboration with HNI, WHO has also provided impregnated bednets for protection against the sandfly vector. ',)"

795,"(' 26 August 2005 The current wave of cholera outbreaks started several weeks ago in West Africa. So far, 31 259 cases and 517 deaths have been reported in eight countries (see map below). Seasonal factors, such as the rainy season, along with population movements in the area contribute to this unusually high incidence of cholera. WHO, with international and national health partners, is providing technical support to the ministries of health at the country and sub-regional level. WHO is working to strengthen surveillance activities. Supplies for case management and chlorination of water have also been dispatched to some of the countries. Breakdown by country: Burkina Faso: 295 cases including 8 deaths (case fatality rate -CFR 2.7%) have been reported in Ouagadougou town as of 22 August, affecting sectors of the town with precarious water and sanitation conditions.

196,"(' Disease Outbreak Reported The WHO team investigating the extended outbreak of human monkeypox continued its mission in Kasai Oriental, Democratic Republic of the Congo in October 1997. It included representatives of the national government, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London, Epicentre, Paris and European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training, Brussels and WHO geneva and Kinshasa. The team identified 419 suspect cases fitting the case definition of a possible or probable case, which, together with those identified in previous surveys, amounts to a total of 511 suspect cases of human monkeypox reported since February 1997. The highest number of suspect cases were in outbreaks in Akungula in August 1997, in Ekanga and neighbouring villages in March 1997 and several other villages in August 1997. Of the 419 suspect cases identified by the team in October 1997, 344 occurred in the Katako Kombe health zone and 75 in the Lodja health zone. Fourteen of them had active disease. Most (85%) of the 344 suspect cases resident in the Katako-Kombe zone were in children under 16 years of age. Thirty-one per cent had had moderate or severe rash, i.e. more than 100 skin lesions, and in 41% the eruption lasted longer than one week. Fever, diarrhoea, cervical lympadenopathy, sore throat and mouth ulcers were the most common symptoms. Ten were hospitalised for up to 30 days and 54% were incapacitated for more than three days. Five died (case fatality ratio 1.5%). These individuals ranged in age from four to eight years and all died within three weeks of rash onset. Twenty had scar evidence of vaccinia vaccination and 19 reported a past history of chicken pox. Twenty-two per cent of the 419 suspect cases identified during this mission were primary, the remainder were defined as secondary. Of these secondary cases, 48% reported contact with another suspect case in the compound, 42% in the household and 53% in the neighbourhood (some had more than one contact). Primary cases with no apparent connection to Akungula and Ekanga villages, were reported from 49 of the total 78 villages where cases were found. Thirty- five per cent of the 419 cases reported being outside their home village in the three weeks before disease onset - the majority in the forest. This outbreak represents the largest ever reported cluster of suspect cases spread over a large area of the Katako-Kombe and Lodja zones. The clinical disease was milder but household secondary attack rate was higher than previously documented, possibly due to an increased number of susceptible individuals after the cessation of vaccinia vaccination, rather than increased person to person transmission. Some of the serum specimens obtained from suspect cases have been positive for varicella, and final analysis will take this into account. Transmission seems to have now ceased at the original epicentre of the outbreak and the immediate surrounding villages. The more recently detected suspect human cases occurred in more geographically distant clusters, the majority with no apparent link to the original outbreak. These suspect cases of sporadic transmission may be due to independent introductions of virus into the human population through increased animal contact. Results of the final analysis will be published simultaneously when laboratory results are available in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the EuroSurveillance Bulletin and the Weekly Epidemiological Record.

214,"(' 31 March 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported Many countries in the Americas are experiencing unexpected outbreaks of cholera associated with extreme weather conditions brought by the arrival of the El Niño phenomenon. During 1998, the following countries have already reported cholera outbreaks: Bolivia (La Paz, El Alto, Valles y Tropico de la Paz) 165 cases and 5 deaths; Honduras (La Mosquitia in Gracias a Dios Department ) 219 cases and 12 deaths; Ecuador (Loja Province) 11 cases and 1 death; Peru (various departments) 2863 cases and 16 deaths; Nicaragua (border area with Honduras) 3 suspected cases. It is expected that other countries in the region will report increased cholera incidence in the coming months. Preventive and control measures are being taken by the Ministries of Health of the affected countries. However, as the epidemic enters its 8th year in the western hemisphere and with the added impact of El Niño, cholera will continue to challenge governments and health agencies; additional international resources for emergency preparedness and control measures will be needed this year. WHO/PAHO are working closely with countries in the region to reactivate cholera preparedness and response plans. ',)"
1244,"("" On 22 August 2017, the National IHR Focal Point for France notified a confirmed fatal case of yellow fever in a 43-year-old Brazilian woman in French Guiana, with an unknown vaccination status. The patient was hospitalized on 7 August 2017 and died on 9 August 2017 at the Cayenne hospital from fulminant hepatitis. She may have visited a gold mining area near St. Elie (North center of the country). Investigations are currently ongoing in order to identify the patient's travel route. On 21 August 2017, the case was laboratory confirmed at the national reference center for arboviruses, Institut Pasteur Cayenne by RT-PCR. This is the first confirmed case diagnosed in this territory since 1998. In French Guiana, yellow fever is considered endemic. The overall immunization coverage is good as yellow fever vaccination is mandatory but immunization coverage might be low in specific populations like clandestine and illegal workers. Therefore, vaccination catch-up will be implemented in legal and illegal gold prospecting areas. ### Public health response French Guiana health authorities are implementing several public health measures: * An initial investigation was performed and further investigations are ongoing. * Vector control interventions are being implemented, especially in specific zones that the case visited. These include health facilities in Cayenne and Kourou, localities of the interior around Saint Elie, and in the Bas-Oyapock river area. * The feasibility of vaccination catch-up targeting workers in legal and illegal gold mining areas is considered. * Communication and messages on prevention measures for yellow fever are being disseminated in French Guiana, including to people who live in those areas. ### WHO risk assessment Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impacts in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection. French Guiana is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travelers over one year of age. Vaccination coverage in French Guiana is optimal, however, the coverage in some populations such as clandestine workers, in mining areas could be sub- optimal and therefore at risk for yellow fever infections. While the exact place of infection remains under investigation, the most likely geographic area of infection appears to be around the border between French Guiana and Brazil along the Oyapock river. At this stage and according to the preliminary data, this case is not epidemiologically linked to the sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks reported from Brazil since January 2017. Sequencing and comparison with yellow fever virus strains from other countries is needed to understand the potential link between the different outbreaks and the evolution of yellow fever virus. Based on the information currently available regarding epidemiological situation and early public health actions, the potential for large epidemic and international spread exists but is limited and could be further reduced by vaccination. ### WHO advice Advice to travelers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in South America includes: * Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. * Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites. * Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever in general population. * Promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present). This case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with favorable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission. Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against Yellow fever disease and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. WHO, therefore, urges Members States to strengthen the control of immunization status of travelers to all potentially endemic areas. Viraemic returning travelers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities. WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restriction be applied on French Guiana based on the information available for this event. "",)"

After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee advised that: * the Ebola outbreak in West Africa constitutes an ‘extraordinary event’ and a public health risk to other States; * the possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries. * a coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola. It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met. The entire statement, including a list of temporary recommendations, can be found at http://who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en/. On Friday, 8 August, the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, gave a press briefing to the international media from WHO Headquarters. Dr Chan will give an additional briefing on the situation of the outbreak and the ongoing response in the region to the Permanent and Observer Missions to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva on Tuesday, 12 August. Permanent Representatives of the affected countries have been invited to speak on behalf of their respective Governments on the national Ebola response and priorities. On Monday, 11 August, WHO will convene a panel of medical ethics experts to begin looking at the use of experimental treatments in the ongoing EVD outbreak in West Africa. At this time, there are no registered medicines or vaccines against this deadly virus; several experimental options are currently under development, though. The recent treatment of two health workers from US faith-based aid organizations has raised questions about whether medicines that have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans should be used in outbreak situations. In the case of Ebola, supplies are extremely limited, which then raises questions about who should receive it, if it’s used. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Between 5 and 6 August 2014, 68 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD and 29 deaths were reported from the four countries as follows: Guinea, 0 new cases and 4 deaths; Liberia, 38 new cases and 12 deaths; Nigeria, 4 new cases and 1 death; and Sierra Leone, 26 new cases and 12 deaths.

There are currently 1,391 cases receiving medical care in hospital, with no additional deaths for 5 consecutive days. HFMD became a notifiable disease in China on 2 May. Because of this change in reporting policy and the increased awareness of the general public about the disease, it is expected there will be an increase in the number of reported cases in the next weeks and months from Anhui province and the rest of China. The Government of China has assured WHO of its strong technical and political commitment to control the disease in Anhui and other provinces. In addition to enhanced surveillance, as there is no specific treatment for enterovirus infections and a vaccine is not currently available, a nation-wide health campaign is ongoing, stressing the need for personal hygiene, especially hand washing. Additional resources have also been provided to paediatric health care providers by the Ministry of Health. HFMD is a common and usually mild childhood disease. EV71 is a frequent cause of HFMD epidemics associated with neurological disease in a small proportion of cases.

867,"(' 25 September 2007 Since late August 2007, an outbreak of cholera has spread to 25 districts of Northern Iraq and 4 districts in Southern Iraq and across the centre of the country. It is estimated that more than 30 000 people have fallen ill with acute watery diarrhoea, among which 2 116 were identified as positive for Vibrio cholerae. The case fatality rate is 0.52% and has remained low throughout the outbreak, although it continues to spread across Iraq and dissemination to as yet unaffected areas remains highly possible. The outbreak was first detected in Kirkuk province, where 68% of laboratory- confirmed cholera cases have so far been reported, and then spread to Sulaymaniah and Erbil provinces. Additional isolated cases of Cholera have also been identified in other parts of the country, including Tikrit (6 cases confirmed), Mosul (2 cases confirmed), Basra (1 case confirmed), Baghdad (2 cases confirmed) and Dahuk (1 case confirmed). The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. However, a severe shortage of chlorination products has been noted and replenishment is urgently needed to enable water supplies to be treated to render it safe for human consumption. Provision of safe water is the highest priority in controlling an outbreak of cholera. WHO continues to support the National and local health authorities in the ongoing response operations. Ten interagency diarrhoeal disease kits, each sufficient to treat 400 moderate and 100 severe cases, arrived in Erbil International airport on 16 September.

1105,"(' Based on epidemiological analysis conducted by WHO, three major factors are contributing to patterns of transmission, which are currently responsible for the continuous propagation of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the sub-region. These factors include transmission of EVD in rural communities, facilitated by strong cultural practices and traditional beliefs; transmission of EVD in densely populated peri-urban areas of Conakry in Guinea and Monrovia in Liberia; and cross-border transmission of EVD along the border areas of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where commercial and social activities continue among the border areas of these countries. ### Health sector response Containment of this outbreak requires a strong response in the countries and especially along their shared border areas. As one of the response elements, WHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub- region scheduled for 2–3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The meeting will bring together Ministers of Health and the Directors of disease prevention and control from 11 African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors, representatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities.

These experts are drawn from WHO offices, GOARN partners, specialised networks, especially in the region, and include: * Field epidemiologists, who are working with the countries in surveillance and monitoring of the outbreak; * Laboratory experts who are providing mobile field laboratories in early confirmation of Ebola cases; * Clinical management experts who are deployed to health facilities and are treating affected patients; * Infection and prevention control experts who are helping countries in their ongoing efforts to stop transmission of the virus in the community and health-care facilities; * Logisticians who are ensuring an operational response platform, and dispatching essential equipment and needed materials; and * Social mobilization and risk communications teams who are helping public health officials to develop and deliver appropriate messages about how to report, handle, and treat Ebola cases. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ### Disease update New cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 25 and 30 June 2014, 22 new cases of EVD, including 14 deaths, were reported from the three countries, as follows: Guinea, 3 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 8 new cases with 7 deaths; and Sierra Leone 11 new cases and 2 deaths. These numbers include laboratory- confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD. As of 30 June 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 759, including 467 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 413 cases (293 confirmed, 88 probable, and 32 suspected) and 303 deaths (193 confirmed, 82 probable, and 28 suspected); Liberia, 107 cases (52 confirmed, 21 probable, and 34 suspected) and 65 deaths (33 confirmed, 17 probable, and 15 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 239 cases (199 confirmed, 31 probable, and 9 suspected) and 99 deaths (65 confirmed, 29 probable, and 5 suspected). ### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 30 June 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals by country Guinea Cases 3 293 88 32 413 Deaths 5 193 82 28 303 Liberia Cases 8 52 21 34 107 Deaths 7 33 17 15 65 Sierra Leone Cases 11 199 31 9 239 Deaths 2 65 29 5 99 Totals Cases 22 544 140 75 759 Deaths 14 291 128 48 467 (1) New cases were reported between 25 and 30 June 2014.

753,"(' 18 May 2005 As of 17 May, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 337 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 311 were fatal. The vast majority of cases have occurred in Uige Province, where 326 cases and 300 deaths have been reported. No cases have been reported outside Uige for the past five weeks. Infrastructures and protocols for controlling the outbreak are in place and functioning well. The isolation unit at Uige’s provincial hospital is being used, infection control in the hospital has improved, and safe burial practices are now being followed. Portable field laboratories continue to provide rapid diagnostic support. A campaign to stop home treatment of patients using unsafe injections has resulted in the collection and safe disposal of a large number of needles and syringes. The campaign, which has been supported by religious and community leaders and volunteers from the local Red Cross, is thought to have raised public awareness of the associated risks considerably. Support from religious and community leaders has also allowed the work of mobile surveillance teams to run more smoothly, increasing the efficiency of case finding and contact tracing. However, some new cases continue to be linked to exposure in homes and at funerals, indicating that public understanding of the disease still needs to be improved. As transmission of the virus requires close personal contact with an ill or recently deceased patient, the risk to international travellers to Angola is considered to be very low. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Angola. ',)"

Two patients have recovered and five are still under treatment. Three of the four new cases were in children who had been in close contact with previously registered cases. Four patients are currently under treatment and two are recovering. A further 111 contacts have been identified. Most (100) are in the Ogooué-Ivindo Province but a few have been reported Moyen Oogoué, Latoursville, Oogoué Lolo and Libreville situated between 300 and 500 km from Booué. The Ministry of Health has taken precautions to assure that these contacts are under strict surveillance. An isolation ward has been prepared in Booué Hospital and samples for laboratory investigation have been collected from patients and close contacts. An education and information campaign for health workers has been undertaken in regions where the epidemic has occurred and in bordering areas where there have been no reports of suspected cases. An International Committee for Technical and Scientific Coordination was established in Gabon with the collaboration of the WHO following the announcement of an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in the Booué region.

A total of 23 cases, including 7 deaths, have been reported to have occurred since October 2011 in Guider, Bibemi, Gaschiga, Lagdo, Mayo Oulo and Golombe districts. These cases were identified as part of the surveillance system, with fever and jaundice within the 14 days of onset. At least 13 cases from six health districts were laboratory confirmed at the Institute Pasteur of Cameroon by IgM ELISA test, which was followed by the seroneutralizing test (PRNT), the most specific test for yellow fever, and by differential diagnostic for dengue and West Nile Virus conducted in the WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, the Institute Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal.

948,"(' 7 OCTOBER 2011 - In 2011 several large measles outbreaks have been reported from Member States in the European and African regions, with several reported outbreaks in the Americas linked to Europe or Africa. Europe: As of 20 September 2011, 40 of 53 Member States in the WHO European Region have reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases for the period January – July 2011 to the WHO European Regional Office through routine surveillance and outbreak reports. The highest number of cases was reported from France with 14 025 cases for the first six months of the year. In addition, eleven of all cases in the Region were lethal (6 in France and one in each of Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The predominant genotype currently circulating in the European Region is D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The most recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September, with 12 cases. Member States have responded to the outbreak by modifying the vaccination schedule, like France, or by offering vaccination free of charge or in schools, to increase accessibility to and availability of vaccines. Africa: The Regional Office reports that as of September 2011 large measles outbreaks are being reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with over 103 000 cases, Nigeria, with 17 428 cases, and Zambia, with 5 397 cases, and Ethiopia, with 2 902 cases. Even though deaths are not routinely reported to the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reports over 1100 measles-associated deaths in the country during 2011. Americas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the region in 2002. In 2011 the Region has received reports of several outbreaks linked to importation of measles virus from other regions. The largest, in Quebec, Canada, involves 742 reported cases, 89 requiring hospitalization, but no measles-associated deaths. Other outbreaks have been reported from the United States (213 cases), Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Columbia (7 cases), Mexico (3 cases), and Chile (6 cases). Most of these outbreaks are linked to importations from Europe, except for outbreaks in the United States and Chile linked to cases from Malaysia and the outbreak in Ecuador, linked to Kenya. Measles is a highly infectious disease that causes complications and deaths, even in previously-healthy individuals, but is fully preventable by vaccination. Countries need to ensure that they reach 95% coverage with two doses of measles vaccine across all age groups up to 15 years of age. Otherwise the country will experience measles outbreaks with large numbers of cases, associated hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in countries with high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles exportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region of the Americas or certain African countries. These exportations can lead to large outbreaks and associated deaths. These outbreaks should remind travellers that they should ensure that they have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine before their trip. ',)"
707,"(' 30 December 2004 WHO has received informal reports of a laboratory-confirmed case of H5N1 infection in Viet Nam. The patient, who has been hospitalized since 26 December, is a 16-year-old girl who fell ill in the southern province of Tay Ninh. Vietnamese authorities are investigating the source of her infection, including the possibility of contact with infected poultry. This is the first human case of H5N1 detected in Viet Nam since early September. It coincides with several fresh poultry outbreaks reported in southern provinces in December. Recent poultry outbreaks in Tay Ninh Province have not been reported. As avian influenza viruses become more active at cooler temperatures, further poultry outbreaks, possibly accompanied by sporadic human cases, can be anticipated. Poultry marketing, transportation, and consumption increase in Viet Nam with the approach of the Lunar New Year in early February. These activities create conditions favouring the spread of poultry outbreaks and call for heightened control measures. Since January of this year, 28 human cases have been detected in Viet Nam. Of these, 20 were fatal. Thailand has also reported human cases, bringing the total in Asia since the beginning of this year to 45 cases, of which 32 have been fatal. ',)"
1429,"("" 4 November 2010 - An acute outbreak of poliomyelitis is occurring in the Republic of Congo, with 120 cases of acute flaccid paralysis and 58 deaths. Half the cases have been reported in the past ten days, with the first case occurring in early October. Two cases have been confirmed to have been caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and laboratory testing continues. Most cases are in young adults: among those cases for which age data is available (43) at this time, 33 are between the ages of 15-25 years. Only one is under five years old, three are between 7 and 13 and five are between 26 and 58. The outbreak is due to imported poliovirus. Congo had recorded its last case of indigenous polio in 2000. Investigations are ongoing to determine definitively the origins of the virus. Nearly all cases have been reported from the port city of Pointe Noire, with cases also reported from Dolisie (2), Kayes, Bouenza, Brazzaville, and Mvouiti (one each). The Government of Congo has alerted the public to the outbreak and launched an emergency response plan, with support from key partners, including WHO, UNICEF and the US CDC. At least three nationwide vaccination campaigns are expected, using monovalent oral polio vaccine and targeting the entire population. The number, geographic extent and target age groups of further campaigns will be determined by the Government based on the evolving epidemiology. It is anticipated that a multi-country campaign will be required to cover bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported every day. It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of Africa strengthen AFP surveillance, in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also strengthen population immunity levels to minimise the consequences of any virus introduction. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International Travel and Health, guidance travellers to and from Angola and DR Congo should be fully protected by vaccination. Given the recent progress achieved in Nigeria (98% reduction in cases this year compared to the same period in 2009), very high priority is being given to rapidly controlling persistent transmission such as in Angola and stopping new outbreaks such as Congo. #### For more information "",)"

1211,"(' On 10 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of 2 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with confirmed Zika virus infection. Both cases are under investigation to determine whether they meet the Brighton Collaboration case definition for GBS. ### Details of the cases * The first case is an elderly male resident of the United States with recent travel to Central America. He developed an acute febrile illness shortly after returning to the U.S. and was subsequently hospitalized in January with progressive ascending weakness of the extremities and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He improved following treatment and was ready to be discharged. However, he experienced a sudden subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm and died. * The second case is an adult male resident of Haiti who experienced an acute onset of facial weakness, difficulty swallowing, and numbness of fingers in early January. No antecedent illness was reported. A few days later, he travelled to the United States for additional medical care. Cerebrospinal fluid had elevated protein and normal white blood cells. Physical examination showed mild weakness and diminished reflexes. The patient tested positive for Zika virus infection by serology. He improved with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and was discharged. ### WHO risk assessment To date, a total of 9 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of GBS and/or laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection among GBS cases. This is the first time that a country with no vector borne transmission of Zika virus detects patients with concomitant GBS and Zika virus infection. These cases provide additional evidence of a possible causal relationship between Zika virus and GBS. Further investigations are needed to understand the implications of pre-existing dengue infections, together with recent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis of GBS. It is likely that countries that are currently reporting autochthonous Zika virus transmission will face a rise in the number of GBS cases in the coming months. However, it is critical to ensure that in all these countries the reported increases in the incidence of GBS are the result of a real change rather than enhanced surveillance. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO recommends Member States affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks to: * monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values; * develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome; * raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors. The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Based on the current available information, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to the United States of America. ',)"

As of 9 June 2017, a total of 501 suspected cases including 104 deaths have been reported since the onset of the current Lassa fever outbreaks season in December 2016. Of the reported cases, 189 have been further classified, 175 laboratory- confirmed including 59 deaths and 14 probable cases (all dead). During the current Lassa fever outbreak, 17 Nigerian states (Anambra, Bauchi, Borno, Cross-River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Kogi, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Plateau, Rivers, and Taraba) have reported at least one confirmed case. As of 9 June 2017, the outbreak is still active in nine states (Anambra, Bauchi, Cross-River, Edo, Taraba, Nasarawa, Ondo, Plateau, and Kano). ### Public health response The ongoing outbreak response is focused at State and federal levels and involves coordination of weekly Lassa fever review meeting in conjunction with World Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), and the African Field Epidemiology Network. The following response measures are being carried out: * Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all affected states and Lassa fever cases are reported to the federal level and contact tracing is ongoing in affected states with an active outbreak through the state surveillance team. * The line listing of cases reported across all the states is ongoing and data are uploaded in the VHF database. * Lassa fever treatment centers have been established in the affected states to support case management. These centers are supplied with case management as well as infection prevention and control supplies. ### WHO risk assessment Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness. Lassa fever is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and other West African countries and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the region, with yearly peaks observed between December and June. Overall, the current risk assessment for Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend of outbreaks. Considering this, ongoing response measures remains focused on preparedness and response in general and further risk of large scale outbreaks is not very high. However, a close follow up, active case searching, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (in the community and for health care workers) should remain ongoing. Although there is constant population movement between these Nigerian states, a large- scale disease transmission or outbreak spread has not been reported. However, there have been sporadic cases reported in Togo and Benin originating from Nigeria. ### WHO advice Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good “community hygiene” to discourage rodents from entering homes. In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. On rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing. ',)"
1220,"(' On 2 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Peru reported 57 cases of Oropouche fever. The majority of cases are from towns located in the northern part of the Cusco Region, which is situated in the Amazon rainforest. Most cases (79%) were detected in January, with only 7% and 14% of the cases being identified in February and March, respectively. To date, there have been no fatalities and all cases have recovered following symptomatic treatment. In February 2016, a field mission to the Madre de Dios Region conducted jointly by the MoH of Peru and PAHO/WHO revealed a mixed outbreak of dengue (DENV-2) and Oropouche viruses. While Madre de Dios already experienced an outbreak of Oropouche fever in 1994, at the time of the mission in February, this latest outbreak was of a higher magnitude (120 confirmed cases). ### Public health response Peruvian health authorities have implemented the following public health measures: * providing medical treatment to the cases; * conducting epidemiological and entomological investigations; * strengthening vector control. ### WHO risk assessment Cases of infection with Oropouche virus have already been reported in the past in Peru. However, it is the first time that the Cusco Region records cases of Oropouche fever. It will be critical to establish whether the competent vector, the Culicoides paraensis midge, is present in Cusco as that could provide some explanation for the emergence of the disease in this specific area. At present, the possibility of further cases being detected in the Cusco Region and in the rest of Peru cannot be excluded. Given the wide geographical distribution of the competent vector in the Region of the Americas, the risk of cases being identified in other countries is significant. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice Given its clinical presentation, Oropouche fever should be included in the clinical differential diagnosis for other common arboviral diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Zika virus). The proximity of midge vector breeding to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Oropouche virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of midges through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between midges and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support midge larvae, reducing the adult midge populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. ### Background Oropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus. In humans, it is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. No direct transmission of the virus from human to human has been documented. Oropouche fever causes symptoms similar to those of dengue with an incubation period of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting. In some patients it can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis. In the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche fever virus have been reported from rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago. ',)"

1052,"(' 1 April 2014 - In this update and subsequent ones, the terminology Ebola haemorrhagic fever will be replaced by Ebola virus disease (EVD) in line with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Therefore, this report provides an update on Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. As at 31 March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 122 clinically compatible cases of EVD, of which 24 are laboratory confirmed by PCR, and 98 are probable (78) or suspected (22) cases. This total number includes 80 deaths, of which 13 (16%) have been laboratory confirmed for EVD and the remaining 67 are considered as probable cases of EVD. These figures correspond to 19 new clinical cases and 14 new deaths since the 28 March. As of 30 March, 20 patients remain in isolation. Eleven health-care workers are among the probable and suspected cases. Cases have been reported from Conakry (11), Guekedou (77), Macenta (23), Kissidougou (8), and 3 from Dabola and Djingaraye combined. Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 400 contacts under medical follow-up at present. Further strengthening of infection prevention and control in health-care facilities is a priority intervention. In addition, efforts are continuing to raise awareness in the community about the importance of personal protective measures to prevent ebolavirus transmission including hand washing, caring for the sick safely in the community, the use of personal protective equipment when handling potentially contaminated blood and body fluids and during environmental cleaning and disinfection, and safe burials. The Ministry of Health of Liberia has reported 8 clinically compatible cases of EVD, including 2 laboratory-confirmed cases, from 14 to 30 March. The 2 confirmed cases were reported from Lofa County. Two patients died; one of the deceased patients has been laboratory confirmed and the other death was in a probable case. Contact tracing is underway. Response activities in Liberia include a press conference by the Ministries of Health & Social Welfare and Ministry of Information, distribution of EVD prevention and control guidelines to health-care workers, training staff on case detection, contact tracing and follow up, clinical case management, infection prevention and control, specimen collection, handling and transportation and the safe handling of deceased patients. Staff from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and WHO have travelled to Lofa County to provide technical support and coordinate control efforts. Clinical specimens from suspected cases are being sent to the laboratory in Conakry, Guinea, for testing. Intensive community awareness raising campaigns are also underway through the mass media, via social mobilization activities and interpersonal communications, and involvement of telephone service providers in sending text messages. The Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone is maintaining a high level of vigilance following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. To date, active surveillance activities have identified no new suspected cases and all contacts of the deceased have remained well. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data. WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since most human infections result from direct contact with the body fluids or secretions of infected patients, particularly in hospitals (nosocomial transmission) and as a result of unsafe procedures, use of contaminated medical devices (including needles and syringes) and unprotected exposure to contaminated body fluids. Travellers should avoid all contact with infected patients. Those who are providing medical care or are involved in the evaluation of an outbreak should wear protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection and practice proper infection prevention and control and measures. Anyone who has stayed in the areas where EVD cases have been recently reported should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness. Clinicians managing returning travellers from visiting these areas with compatible symptoms are advised to take into consideration the possibility of EVD. Malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers are differential diagnosis to consider in these patients.

This brings to date a total of 7 new cases nationwide (4 confirmed, 3 suspected), including 6 new cases and 6 new deaths reported from Conakry (2 new cases and 1 death), Gueckedou (1 new case and 1 death), Macenta (1 new case and 1 death), and Telimele (2 new cases and 2 deaths) during this period. Cumulatively the total number of cases and deaths attributable to EVD in Guinea is 351 (210 laboratory-confirmed, 83 probable, and 58 suspected) including 226 deaths by 5 June 2014. The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Conakry, 67 cases and 29 deaths; Gueckedou, 194 cases and 146 deaths; Macenta, 45 cases and 27 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and 4 deaths; Kissidougou, 7 cases and 5 deaths; Dinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death; Telimele, 25 cases and 7 deaths; Boffa, 7 cases and 6 deaths; and Kouroussa, 1 case and 1 death. In terms of isolation, 33 patients are currently hospitalized (8 in Conakry, 9 in Gueckedou, 15 in Telimele, and 1 in Boffa). The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 1011 distributed as follows: Conakry, 329 contacts; Gueckedou, 317 contacts; Macenta, 176 contacts; Telimele, 111 contacts; and Boffa, 78 contacts. ### Liberia No new cases have been reported from Liberia, however 11 contacts (5 health- care workers and 6 community relatives) are currently being followed-up. These contacts were of the probable case from nearby Kailahun, Sierra Leone who died in Foya, Liberia. The deceased was taken back to Kailahun for burial. ### Sierra Leone As of 18:00 on 6 June 2014, 8 new cases (2 confirmed and 6 suspected) and 1 new death were reported from Kailahun (3 cases and 1 death), Kenema (1 case and 0 deaths), Bo (1 case and 0 deaths), Port Loko (1 case and 0 deaths), and Freetown (2 cases and 0 deaths). This brings the total number of EVD clinical cases to 89 (33 confirmed, 3 probable, and 53 suspected) including 7 deaths. All 33 confirmed cases and 7 deaths were reported from Kailahun district. The number of cases among health-care workers is 5 and deaths is 1. There are currently 11 cases in isolation at Kenema Hospital. The number of contacts currently being followed-up is 30. Community resistance is hindering the identification and follow-up of contacts. Overall, the total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data and enhanced surveillance. ### WHO response WHO and partners continue to support the implementation of preventive and control measures in the affected countries. In Sierra Leone, WHO is training health-care workers on case and data management and in reviewing messages for social mobilization. Currently, there is only 1 isolation facility located at Kenema. WHO and partners are establishing two Isolation sites in Darra and Koindu. Clinicians and infection prevention and control experts will be deployed to manage the new isolation sites. Four proposals which were developed with support from WHO have received funding from CERF, OCHA Emergency Fund, DFID, and the African Development Bank (ADB). Guinea and Liberia have also received funding from ADB. In Guinea, the joint WHO/HQ and AFRO mission continues to provide support on reviewing the outbreak response operations. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ',)"

Although the outbreak is in regression in the province of Katanga, the situation in Sud- Kivu, Nord-Kivu and Orientale provinces is still of serious concern. Many activities to prevent further spread and to treat affected populations are being undertaken by the MOH in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, MSF and other NGO's. From 1 April to 18 May, 77 cases of cholera and 3 deaths have been reported in Bujumbura Province, Burundi. The districts of Buyenzi, Bwiza, Cibitoke and Musaga are the most affected. Health education and activities to improve sanitation are being carried out by the MOH. Cases of cholera started to be reported in Rwanda in March in Cyangugu prefecture which is on the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although the number of cases is not very high at present, there is major concern about further spread to other areas of the country. In Uganda, the dramatic cholera outbreak which started in late 1997 is still affecting the country with over 20,000 cases and over 1,000 deaths reported since the beginning of the year.

Stool samples were collected and analyzed at the Pasteur Institutes in Cameroon and Bangui, Central African Republic. Blood samples were negative in tests for haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed the Sd1 strains were sensitive to quinolones and cephalosporines but resistant to antibiotics commonly recommended for treatment of shigella. Shigella dysenteriae type 1, also known as Shiga bacillus, is the most virulent of the four serogroups of Shigella and the only cause of epidemic dysentery.

Detailed data are available for Uige, the most severely affected province, where surveillance has been steadily improving. As of 14 April, 224 cases have been reported. Of these cases, 207 were fatal. Most cases have occurred in Uige municipality, which has reported 175 cases and 163 deaths. Much smaller numbers of cases have been reported from a further 7 municipalities in this province. Improvement of public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control measures has become one of the most urgent priorities. Today, meetings were held in the WHO office in Uige with traditional community leaders, known as Sobas, for all of Uige municipality. The governor of the province and the director of its health services have released the Sobas from their present duties for seven days so that they can accompany mobile surveillance and medical teams as they search for cases and collect bodies. This decision is welcomed as an important step forward in achieving community acceptance of measures needed to bring the outbreak under control. WHO staff in Uige now plan to systematically extend the same procedures, using locally respected Sobas, to all other municipalities known to be affected by the disease. This plan is supported by the authorities. Training to protect staff at the provincial hospital from infection and reduce the risk of transmission is continuing. Today, training was provided for 82 nurses in high-risk departments, including the maternity ward and the laboratory. Heads of departments and doctors were trained yesterday. Training for health staff in private clinics and for health workers in the police force is planned for early next week.

739,"(' 13 April 2005 As of 11 April, 231 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 210 have died. Uige Province, with 202 cases and 190 deaths, remains the most severely affected area. The present outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever is unprecedented in its size and urban nature, and its dimensions are still unfolding. Although surveillance to detect cases has improved, it remains patchy. In Uige, where daily mobile teams are active, surveillance continues to be largely concentrated on the investigation of deaths and collection of bodies. The security of teams remains a concern. More vehicles are needed and WHO is making the necessary arrangements on an urgent basis. To bring the outbreak under control, the detection and isolation of patients needs to be much earlier, but this will not happen until the public understands the disease and the high risks associated with treating patients in homes. Infection control needs to improve in heath care settings, and WHO is continuing to supply effective personal protective equipment, for both national and international staff, adapted to conditions in African countries. A welcome development is the decision by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to strengthen its presence in Uige. Volunteers from these societies are part of a group of workers mobilized to conduct a door-to-door public information and education campaign in collaboration with community and church leaders and traditional healers. Today, workers received specialized training from experts in social mobilization and medical anthropology drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. These workers have been rapidly deployed to deliver public talks at markets and schools. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has extensive experience in responding to emergencies in Africa and has been instrumental in bringing large outbreaks of Ebola under control. Because of this experience, workers from the Federation are usually viewed by communities as welcome help. WHO anticipates that this added and welcome support to response activities will help create greater acceptance of control measures and reduce high-risk behaviours. Advice for travellers All currently available data indicate that casual contact plays no role in the spread of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Transmission requires extremely close contact involving exposure to blood or other bodily fluids from a patient who will most likely be showing visible signs of illness. The disease can also be transmitted following exposure to items, including bedding and clothing, recently contaminated by a patient. In addition, transmission can occur in hospitals lacking adequate equipment and supplies for infection control and training in their proper use. The hospital system in Angola has suffered from almost three decades of civil unrest, and several cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have occurred in health care staff exposed during the treatment of patients in Uige. To date, WHO is not aware of any cases of Marburg that have occurred in foreign nationals other than those involved in the care of cases in Uige. WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel to any destination within Angola, but does advise some precautions. Travellers to Angola should be aware of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and of the need to avoid close contact with ill persons. Persons with existing medical conditions who might require hospitalization should consider deferring non-essential travel to Angola, particularly to Uige Province. Those travelling to Angola for the purpose of working in health care settings should be fully informed regarding the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, equipped with effective personal protective equipment, and trained in the procedures to prevent transmission in such settings. Travellers leaving Angola should be advised to seek medical attention should any illness with fever develop within 10 days of their departure. Information about recent travel to Angola should be included when symptoms are reported. Health care workers and health authorities in countries neighbouring Angola should be aware of the symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and maintain vigilance for cases. Countries having close ties with Angola, necessitating frequent travel there by their citizens, may want to consider the introduction of measures to increase vigilance for potential symptoms in persons returning from Angola. In some cases, the introduction of screening procedures to identify potentially infected persons may be considered. WHO recommends that travellers with a clear exposure history be treated as contacts and placed under surveillance for 21 days, during which time their temperature should be monitored daily. ',)"

More than 520 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. In Jiangsu, investigation is ongoing into a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness. The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance. Retrospective testing of recently reported cases with severe respiratory infection may uncover additional cases that were previously unrecognized. An inter-government task force has been formally established, with the National Health and Family Planning Commission leading the coordination along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other key ministries. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that information is available and that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir).

Cholera cases have appeared in different areas of the country, and all have been food-related. Five confirmed cases of leptospirosis have been reported, four in Guatemala City and two in Esquintla. Nicaragua has reported 335 cholera cases and confirmed 301 in laboratories. The cases include 156 in Managua, 46 in Carazo, 25 in Masaya, 18 in Matagalpa, 16 in Chinandega, and 13 in Estelí, with the rest scattered in six other areas. Nicaragua has also reported 264 possible leptospirosis cases, of which 42 have been confirmed by laboratory, including 30 in Chinandega, 11 in Estelí, and one in Madriz. Seven people have died from leptospirosis, often transmitted by contact with water contaminated by rodent urine or feces. Honduras has reported 14 cases of cholera, 4 cases of leptospirosis with three deaths, 1,080 cases of dengue, 15 confirmed cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever with four deaths, and 1,567 cases of malaria, including seven deaths. Belize has reported a cholera outbreak in Saint Martin Village, with 11 suspected and five confirmed cases, including one death. The source of infection is thought to be contamined water from Roaring Creek, authorities said. In all countries, health authorities have taken control measures to improve food safety and to guarantee the quality of water for human consumption, and have sent doctors and epidemiologists to areas where outbreaks have been reported to take control measures and educate the communities on preventive measures, Dr Roses said. Emergency supplies are arriving and being widely distributed, using the PAHO- designed SUMA Humanitarian Supply Management system, Dr. de Ville said, ""but we already see in the field many unusable supplies and expired medicines."" The real problem for Central America will be reconstruction and rehabilitation, Dr. de Ville said. ""The big item for the health sector in Honduras, for example, is reconstruction of the water system, which we estimate will cost some $180 million out of an estimated $220 million in health reconstruction costs, and is a very important priority."" Noting that PAHO has mobilized some 60 experts to the countries hardest hit by the hurricane, in addition to the 150 already there, Dr. de Ville said, ""We have a lot to learn from this disaster. Were we sufficiently prepared? Could we have done better? How can we emphasize disaster mitigation to ensure damages will not be so heavy next time?"" He said an evaluation meeting will be held on Hurricanes Mitch and Georges February 9th to 12th. PAHO, founded in 1902, provides technical collaboration in a broad range of fields including emergency preparedness and disaster relief.

1036,"(' 1 October 2013 - Three suspected cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from South Sudan are currently being investigated. All three patients are girls, two of whom are approximately two-years-old and one is eight-years-old. All had previously been immunized with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Two of the patients are from North Bahr El Gazal state (close to the border with Sudan), and one is from Eastern Equatoria state (close to the border with Kenya and Uganda). They developed paralysis between 15-24 August 2013. Genetic sequencing is ongoing to provide final confirmation of the laboratory results to determine the origin of the isolated viruses. The Horn of Africa is currently experiencing an outbreak of WPV1, with 174 cases in Somalia, 14 cases in Kenya and three cases in Ethiopia. Because of the routes of poliovirus spread in previous Horn of Africa outbreaks, South Sudan had been considered at high risk of re-infection. In 2013, South Sudan conducted two National Immunization Days (NIDs) in March 2013 and April 2013, with additional NIDs planned for November 2013 and December 2013. Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) were conducted in August 2013. Contingency plans for an emergency outbreak response are currently being finalized, including an immediate supplementary immunization activity (SIA) in and around the infected areas. An international team of experts is being deployed to South Sudan, to assist the local authorities in further case investigations, planning for appropriate outbreak response, and further intensifying active searches for additional potential cases. Immunization rates in neighbouring Sudan and Uganda are also being assessed to determine overall population immunity levels. As needed, additional SIAs will be conducted to help fill any identified immunity gaps. Uganda conducted SNIDs in July 2013 and September 2013, with further SNIDs planned for October 2013 and NIDs in December 2013. Sudan plans to conduct NIDs in November 2013 and December 2013. Outbreak response in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia is continuing. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with poliovirus-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Through its Regional Offices for Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, the World Health Organization (WHO) is continuing its support to countries in planning and implementing emergency outbreak response activities across the region. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. ',)"

1288,"("" On 15 July, the outbreak of cholera was officially declared by the Ministry of Public Health of Niger. The first three cases were residents of Nigeria from Jibiya Local Government Area (LGA) in Katsina State on the border with Niger. The cases were all from the same family and reportedly had an onset of symptoms in Jibiya LGA before seeking treatment on 5 July 2018 at a health facility in a bordering town in Niger. Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 Inaba was confirmed in stool samples from all three cases, one of which died within minutes of admission. In addition to these cases, six cases were reported in the following two days from villages in Niger located approximately 4km away from Jibiya LGA. Since then, the outbreak has continuously expanded geographically and in magnitude with peaks of around 400 cases reported in two weeks in August and in early September. As of 1 October 2018, 3692 cases (14% of these were cases in Nigerian residents seeking care in Niger) with 68 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.8%) have been reported from twelve health districts in four regions: Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua, and Zinder. Four affected districts (Aguié, Guidam Roumji, Madarounfa, and Maradi commune) in Maradi Region and two affected districts (Birni Koni, and Mabalza) in Tahoua Region are on the border with Nigeria, while Gaya District in Dosso Region is close to the border with both Benin and Nigeria. Overall, 34 cases from four regions have been confirmed for Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba at the Centre for Medical and Health Research (CERMES) in Niamey: Dosso Region (1), Zinder Region (3), Maradi Region (10) and Tahoua region (20). Poor sanitary conditions in the affected areas have been implicated in the spread of the outbreak. Frequent population movement between Niger and neighbouring Katsina State in Nigeria, which is also experiencing an upsurge in cases of cholera, is likely impacting on the outbreak. ### Public health response The following public health response sections have been implemented: * Multisectoral cholera outbreak coordination structures have been set up at the district, regional and national levels. A regular National Epidemic Management Committee (NEMC) meeting is being held under the leadership of the Ministry of Health (MoH).In addition, WHO is finalizing the WHO action plan to support the MoH. * WHO is supporting the deployment of eight epidemiologists to the Maradi and Tahoua regions to support surveillance activities. * Surveillance activities are being scaled up with support from WHO and other partners and the daily reporting and line listing of cases have been established. * Cholera treatment centres have been put in place by the Ministry of Health with the support of Médecins Sans Frontières, and the Non-governmental Organization (NGO) ALIMA (partnered with the local NGO Bien Être de la Femme et l'Enfant au Niger (BEFEN)). In total, six treatment sites have been set up in the affected districts and initial medical supplies have been dispatched. Niger has laboratory capacity through the national laboratory (CERMES) which confirmed Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 Inaba. * Social mobilization and risk communication activities are being scaled-up with support from UNICEF and Niger Red Cross, focusing on hygiene messages. * Currently, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities are focusing on the distribution of aqua tabs. ### WHO risk assessment The current outbreak started in Madarounfa district in Maradi Region, one of the known hotspots for cholera along the Niger – Nigeria border, and has since spread to three geographically dispersed regions, including some of the most affected districts during previous cholera outbreaks. These areas are classified as high-risk areas for the spread of cholera given the presence of local risk factors such as poor hygiene and sanitary conditions coupled with significant population movement and trade between these districts and neighbouring areas in Nigeria. With the ongoing rainy season and the increase in cases in neighbouring Katsina State in Nigeria, the potential for further spread of the disease both within Niger and across the border with Nigeria is high. The population in the capital city Niamey as well as neighbouring Benin are at risk of being affected given the confirmation of cases in the Dosso Region which is a major trading hub on the border with Benin but also links the capital city Niamey. The bridge connecting Niger to Benin across the Niger River close to Gaya town has collapsed on 5 September, which may slow down population movement across this particular border but also forces the population to travel longer distances (possibly through Burkina Faso and Nigeria) to maintain economic and personal links with the other countries in the region. The recent upsurge of cholera cases in Borno State in Nigeria also puts the population in Niger’s Diffa Region at risk given porous borders and mass movement in this area. The last major cholera outbreak reported in Niger occurred in 2014 and involved more than 2000 cases. ### WHO advice WHO recommends proper and timely case management in Cholera Treatment Centres. Improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities, are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with the international community based on the information available on the current outbreak. For further information, please refer to: "",)"

More than 40% of the total number of cases have occurred within the past 21 days. However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities. * The overall case fatality rate is 52%. It ranges from 42% in Sierra Leone to 66% in Guinea. * A separate outbreak of Ebola virus disease, which is not related to the outbreak in West Africa, was laboratory-confirmed on 26 August by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is detailed in a separate edition of the Disease Outbreak News. ### Health sector response A full understanding of the outbreak that will lead to improved response requires detailed analysis of exactly where transmission is occurring (by district level) and of time trends. This analysis is ongoing. Preliminary results show that cases are still concentrated (62% of all reported cases since the beginning of the outbreak) in the epicentre of the outbreak in Gueckedou (Guinea); Lofa (Liberia), where cases continue to rise; and Kenema and Kailahun (Sierra Leone). Capital cities are of particular concern, owing to their population density and repercussions for travel and trade. WHO and its partners are on the ground establishing Ebola treatment centres and strengthening capacity for laboratory testing, contact tracing, social mobilization, safe burials, and non-Ebola health care. WHO continues to monitor for reports of rumoured or suspected cases from countries around the world and systematic verification of these cases is ongoing. Countries are encouraged to continue engaging in active surveillance and preparedness activities. Cases of EVD have been reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The cases in DRC are not related to the outbreak in West Africa. Outside of the four affected countries in West Africa and DRC, no new cases have been confirmed in other countries. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

1308,"In the Western Pacific Region (WPR), there has been a significant increase in reported measles cases between 2016 and 2017, with a 31% rise in cases. However, in 2018, there was a decrease in cases reported in WPR, with 26,163 cases reported compared to 11,118 in 2017. This resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO regions, with an unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas in WPR in 2019. Nine countries and areas in WPR have achieved measles elimination, but several countries and areas have reported outbreaks due to low immunization coverage and vaccine hesitancy. The WHO Regional Office for WPR is urging Member States to intensify surveillance for acute rash and fever, intensify messaging for clinicians to notify all cases, and ensure contingency resources are available for outbreak investigation and response immunization. The recent outbreaks have been fuelled by low immunization coverage, low immunization coverage among subpopulations, movement of people domestically and internationally, and vaccine hesitancy. Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing “zero-dose” to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread. * Update and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO’s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. WHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel restrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide how best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and communities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports, including on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful adjunct to raising measles awareness in the community. People planning international travel should ensure they have been vaccinated against measles because of the high risk of exposure to the measles virus from fellow travellers and in many countries in the world where measles is currently spreading. The current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to renew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures detailed in the “Measles Elimination Field Guide”1 and the “Regional Strategy and Plan of Action”2 to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the risk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission. * * * 1Measles Elimination Field Guide (WPR, 2013) 2Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific (WPR, 2018) 3The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (EURO, 2013) ',)"

To correct this misunderstanding, WHO called a press conference at the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva on 14 August. Dr Isabelle Nuttall, speaking on behalf of WHO, said, “Air travel, even from Ebola-affected countries, is low-risk for Ebola transmission.” Dr Nuttall further clarified modes of transmission for Ebola and emphasized that the disease is not an airborne virus, unlike influenza or tuberculosis. The infection is transmitted to others through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person, such as blood, vomit, sweat, and diarrhoea. Even if an individual infected with EVD travels by plane, the likelihood of other passengers and crew coming into contact with the individual’s bodily fluids is very low. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.) Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at: On 13 August, Heads of Global Information Systems (GIS) for WHO, UN agencies, intergovernmental agencies, and partners met to continue mapping the EVD crisis and create an interagency common operations picture. This will allow WHO and other organizations responding to the crisis in the affected countries to pinpoint where personnel and material should be concentrated for an effective end to the outbreak. ### Disease update #### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 13 August 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals Guinea Cases 9 376 133 10 519 Deaths 3 245 133 2 380 Liberia Cases 116 190 423 173 786 Deaths 58 154 190 69 413 Nigeria Cases 0 11 0 1 12 Deaths 1 4 0 0 4 Sierra Leone Cases 27 733 38 39 810 Deaths 14 309 34 5 348 Totals Cases 152 1310 594 223 2127 Deaths 76 712 357 76 1145 (1) New cases were reported between 12 and 13 August 2014.

No human cases have been detected to date. Nigerian officials have confirmed outbreaks at commercial farms in the states of Kano, Plateau, Katsina, and Bauchi, and in the Abuja area. Outbreaks have also been detected at more farms in Kaduna. Outbreaks in additional states are currently under investigation. To date, four patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of exposure to diseased poultry have been investigated for possible infection. This number includes a woman who died of an acute respiratory illness on 16 February. The three remaining patients are all in good condition. Arrangements are being made to send samples from all four patients for testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. The initial outbreak in Kaduna state is now known to have begun on 10 January, raising the possibility that earlier human exposures and cases may have occurred in that area and elsewhere. At hospitals in Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina near affected farms, staff from the WHO-led teams have now examined hundreds of patient records, searching for possible cases that may have occurred earlier. No such cases have been identified to date. The scale of the outbreak in birds is not yet fully understood. Most investigations have followed poultry deaths on large commercial farms, where outbreaks are highly visible. Little is known about the presence of the virus in small backyard flocks, where the greatest risk of human exposures and infections resides. Nigeria has an estimated poultry population of around 140 million birds, largely concentrated in the south-western part of the country. As is the case in several affected parts of South-east Asia, around 60% of Nigeria’s poultry production takes place in small backyard flocks. Large-scale commercial farming of poultry occurs mainly in the northern states, where outbreaks have been confirmed. Rapid spread of the virus within Nigeria has raised concern over possible spread to neighbouring countries. Borders are porous and restrictions on the movement of people and poultry are difficult to enforce. WHO staff at offices in these countries are monitoring the situation closely in collaboration with government officials.

738,"(' 7 April 2005 As of 6 April, 200 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 173 have died. Kuanza Sul has reported its first case, bringing the number of affected provinces to six, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country. International diagnostic and laboratory support For laboratory work, Marburg virus has been classified as an extremely hazardous pathogen and can be handled safely only in specialized high- containment laboratories. WHO has established an international network of expert laboratories for the diagnosis of Marburg and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Within this network, laboratories in Canada, Germany, South Africa, and the USA are providing diagnostic support for the Angolan outbreak. All have experience in working with Marburg virus. Scientists from these laboratories are sharing test results and information on laboratory techniques in a virtual network and during weekly teleconferences. To ensure accurate tracking of the outbreak, members of the network are also standardizing methods for sample collection, testing, and the interpretation of results. The various diagnostic tests for Marburg haemorrhagic fever require skilled technical interpretation, as findings can vary according to the phase of the patient’s illness, the way in which samples were taken, and the type of test used. In Angola, a portable field laboratory is now operating in Uige and a second one should be operational in Luanda shortly. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly. The laboratory network is providing backup support for situations in which exceptionally precise diagnostic results are important because of the implications for control measures. Such situations include the possible exportation of a case to another country, and a suspected case in a person who may have placed numerous other people at unusually high risk. Sophisticated laboratory studies of the virus may help shed some light on certain unusual features of the outbreak, including the high fatality rate and the overwhelming concentration of initial cases in children under the age of five years. In this regard, comparisons of the virus with strains from previous outbreaks may be instructive. A longer-term objective, whose achievement has long proved elusive, is to determine where Marburg virus hides in nature between outbreaks. Studies of viruses from Angola may offer some clues. Prior to the present outbreak, Angola was not considered to fall within the geographical “hot zone”, thought to be in central and eastern Africa, for outbreaks and sporadic cases of this rare disease. Laboratories in the Marburg virtual network include: * Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory,Winnipeg, Canada and field laboratory in Uige, Angola * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Special Pathogen Branch, Atlanta, USA and field laboratory in Luanda, Angola * Bernhard-Nocht-Institut für Tropenmedizin, Hamburg, Germany * Institut für Virologie, Marburg, Germany * National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory, Special Pathogens Unit, Sandringham, South Africa.

The outbreaks, which are laboratory confirmed, have been detected in Hunan and Hubei provinces. A confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza at a duck farm in Guangxi province was announced on 27 January. As announced today, outbreaks of disease in poultry have also been detected at farms in Anhui, Shanghai, and Guangdong provinces. According to the authorities, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza is the suspected cause. Samples from birds in these outbreaks are being tested, in China, to confirm the causative agent. Local authorities in the affected provinces have undertaken immediate culling operations and quarantining of farms. Compulsory vaccination of poultry is being introduced. At present, no human cases of H5N1 infection have been detected in China. Development of an H5N1 vaccine for humans: need for samples and viruses With the confirmed spread of H5N1 infection in poultry in China, WHO is again stressing the need for access to samples and viruses from all countries currently experiencing H5N1 outbreaks. Such materials are needed to support laboratory studies being conducted by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Up to now, laboratories in the WHO network have analyzed viruses from the current outbreaks made available by authorities in Cambodia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam. Viruses from the outbreaks in Indonesia, Laos, and Thailand are expected to be available for analysis soon. Network laboratories are now working to develop a prototype virus that can be recommended by WHO for use by companies in the production of a human vaccine effective against H5N1 influenza strains. Both human and avian viruses are needed. Information from these viruses will help WHO and its partners ensure that a fully tested and licensed vaccine for humans is available as soon as possible. Protection of workers involved in culling operations As more countries announce plans for the mass slaughter of poultry, WHO continues to stress the need for personal protection of these workers. Targeted administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to high-risk groups, such as cullers and poultry workers, is being recommended as one of several measures that reduce opportunities for the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype with pandemic potential. Guidelines for the use of seasonal influenza vaccine in humans at risk of H5N1 infection have been issued today. ',)"
346,"(' 29 February 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported The outbreak of listeriosis reported in France began during the second half of December 1999. Twenty six cases including 7 deaths have so far been reported and the number of cases is expected to increase slightly in the next few days given the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 2 months). The Ministry of Health issued a press release stating that a pork tongue in jelly is suspected to be the origin of the outbreak, on the basis of case-control study data. However, the name of the brand has not yet been identified and the Pasteur Institute in Paris is screening Listeria monocytogenes food isolates to detect the epidemic clone. Food contaminated with L. monocytogenes is a significant source of illness and death worldwide. The case-fatality rate in recent outbreaks and sporadic cases is around 20%-30%. From early August 1998 to 6 January 1999, at least 50 cases caused by a rare strain of the bacterium L. monocytogenes, serotype 4b, were reported in the United States. Six adults died and 2 pregnant women had spontaneous abortions. The vehicle for transmission was identified as hot-dogs and possibly processed meats produced under many brand names by one manufacturer. Listeria in ready-to-eat foods was identified as a priority for risk assessment by the Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH) in order to develop an international strategy for the reduction of illness from this source. In response, WHO and FAO are undertaking risk assessments for L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods. In October 2000, the preliminary report of a Joint FAO/WHO consultation on microbiological risk assessment will be delivered to CCFH, which is expected to define more focused questions for further study.

1268,"(' On 8 May 2018, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of two confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease occurring in Bikoro health zone, Equateur province. From 4 April through 9 May 2018, a total of 32 Ebola virus disease cases (among which two are confirmed, 18 probable and 12 suspected cases) were reported from Bikoro health zone, Equateur province, including 18 deaths. Three of the 32 cases were among healthcare workers. The patients presented with fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, myalgia and arthralgia, and some also showed haemorrhagic signs and symptoms. All cases were reported from the catchment area of the Ikoko-Impenge health facility, located 30 km from the central health zone office of Bikoro, which is 280 km by road from Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur province. Of the 21 initially reported cases on 8 May 2018, 17 had epidemiological links (potential contacts with another suspect case). Five samples were collected from hospitalized patients, three from Ikoko- Impenge and two from Bikoro. These were sent to Institute National de Recherche Biomédicale in Kinshasa on 7 May 2018, where the two samples from Ikoko-Impenge were found positive by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for Ebola virus on the same day. Over the last four decades, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced eight Ebola outbreaks. The most recent epidemic took place in May 2017 in the health zone of Likati, province of Bas-Uele. The ongoing epidemic is located in the Bikoro health zone, located in Equateur province, in western Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the border with the Republic of Congo. This is the fourth time that an Ebola outbreak has been reported in the former province of Equateur, following those of 1976, 1977 and 2014. However, this is the first time that the Bikoro health zone is facing an Ebola outbreak. The province of Equateur has an estimated population of 2.5 million people with 284 registered health facilities. Bikoro health zone has a population of around 163 000 people with three hospitals and 19 health centres covering the population, most with limited functionality. Medical supplies are provided by international bodies, but stock outs are frequent. ### Public health response * The Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo deployed Rapid Response Teams to investigate cases and deaths reported in Bikoro health zone in the Equateur province. * One million US dollars from the WHO contingency fund for emergencies have been mobilized. * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and Partners in the activation of multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response at all levels. * Médecins Sans Frontières is setting up a treatment centre for the management of cases in Bikoro health zone. * WHO has shared risk communication materials in French and Lingala with the WHO country offices. * Active surveillance activities among the community, the Ikoko-Impenge health centre team and Bikoro General Reference Hospital are being undertaken. * Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established. * Wellcome Trust is providing two million pounds sterling for the critical research needed to support the operational response which is now underway in the country. ### WHO risk assessment To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote area and appears to be geographically limited. However, in view of the available data, the overall risk is considered high at the national level due to the nature of the disease and the lack of epidemiological and demographic information to estimate the magnitude of the epidemic. The overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the proximity to the Congo river, which links with both the capitals of the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Information is currently limited and investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak. Based on the information currently available and the rapid response measures implemented by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and partners, the event does not meet the criteria of a public heath emergency of international concern as defined in the IHR (2005)1, and does not warrant the convening of an Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005). ### WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions of the international traffic in place. For more information on Ebola virus disease, please see the link below: * * * 1 “Public health emergency of international concern” means an extraordinary event which is determined, as provided in these Regulations: (i) to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and (ii) to potentially require a coordinated international response”.

To correct this misunderstanding, WHO called a press conference at the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva on 14 August. Dr Isabelle Nuttall, speaking on behalf of WHO, said, “Air travel, even from Ebola-affected countries, is low-risk for Ebola transmission.” Dr Nuttall further clarified modes of transmission for Ebola and emphasized that the disease is not an airborne virus, unlike influenza or tuberculosis. The infection is transmitted to others through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person, such as blood, vomit, sweat, and diarrhoea. Even if an individual infected with EVD travels by plane, the likelihood of other passengers and crew coming into contact with the individual’s bodily fluids is very low. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.) Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at: On 13 August, Heads of Global Information Systems (GIS) for WHO, UN agencies, intergovernmental agencies, and partners met to continue mapping the EVD crisis and create an interagency common operations picture. This will allow WHO and other organizations responding to the crisis in the affected countries to pinpoint where personnel and material should be concentrated for an effective end to the outbreak. ### Disease update #### Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 13 August 2014 New (1) Confirmed Probable Suspect Totals Guinea Cases 9 376 133 10 519 Deaths 3 245 133 2 380 Liberia Cases 116 190 423 173 786 Deaths 58 154 190 69 413 Nigeria Cases 0 11 0 1 12 Deaths 1 4 0 0 4 Sierra Leone Cases 27 733 38 39 810 Deaths 14 309 34 5 348 Totals Cases 152 1310 594 223 2127 Deaths 76 712 357 76 1145 (1) New cases were reported between 12 and 13 August 2014.

Both cases are male Kenyan nationals, in their early 30s, working in Luanda, Angola. Both travelled while symptomatic and none were vaccinated against yellow fever prior to traveling to Angola. The first case developed symptoms on 8 March in Luanda and travelled to Kenya on 12 March. At his arrival, he was hospitalized in a private clinic in Nairobi and was later referred to another health care facility. The patient died after experiencing multi-organ failure. The second case presented symptoms on 1 March in Luanda, and flew back to Kenya on 7 March. He went to his home town (Namanga) on the Kenyan-Tanzanian Border. He returned to Nairobi to seek treatment on 11 March where he was hospitalised. The patient was treated and has since recovered and been discharged. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed on samples of both cases by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). RT-PCR was negative for the two cases; however, samples from both cases tested positive for anti-YF IgM antibody. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is currently being conducted. ### Public health response The Kenyan government has taken the following measures: * urging all county health departments and relevant stakeholders to enhance disease surveillance, in particular for yellow fever, at points of entry (PoEs) and within the country; * carrying out social mobilization activities; * activating a national task force to manage the detected imported cases; * strengthening the testing capability of the reference laboratory; * reactivating the viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) national task force to update VHF preparedness and early-response plans; * providing information to travellers on yellow fever vaccination and implementation of inspection of yellow fever certificates at PoEs. ### WHO risk assessment The risk of sustained local transmission is considered to be minimal since the density of the competent vector, the Aedes aegypti, in Nairobi is very low and none-of the two cases arrived in a viraemic state. However, it is important to highlight that yellow fever introduction represents a potential threat in areas of the country where the risk factors for yellow fever are present (human susceptibility, prevalence of the competent vector, animal reservoirs). The possibility of further international disease spread from Kenya to other countries is also considered to be low; nevertheless, the report of yellow fever infection in non-immunized travellers returning from a country where vaccination against the disease is mandatory underlines the need to reinforce the implementation of vaccination requirements, in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.

In the current outbreak, a 9-year-old boy who travelled to Fujian Province (China) in January with his mother and his two sisters became ill on February 9 and was admitted to a Hong Kong hospital on February 12. He has recovered and is in a stable condition. Other members of his family presented with a similar illness. The child’s sister and father have died. The boy’s mother was ill but has recovered. It is not yet known whether the other family members were also infected with influenza A(H5N1). A medical and epidemiological investigation is ongoing in Hong Kong to determine the cause of those illnesses. Results should be available in the next few days. Investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the infection. The World Health Organization is collaborating closely with health authorities in Hong Kong SAR and China in investigating the outbreak. The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance network has been alerted. ',)"
1228,"(' From 1 September 2016 until 13 January 2017, a total of 693 cases including 11 deaths of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) have been reported from Am Timan, Chad. Of the 50 patients with AJS who were hospitalized, 48 were tested for Hepatitis E using the Hepatitis E virus rapid diagnostic test (HEV RDT) and 27 (56.3%) tested positive. In total, at the end of epidemiological week 2, 2017, a total of 126 HEV RDT have been performed, of them 57 (45.2%) were positive, while 69 (54.8%) tested negative for Hepatitis E. 18 (31.6%) of the 57 patients that tested positive using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test, and 20 (29%) out of 69 patients that tested negative using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test. Since September 2016, 11 deaths have been reported among the hospitalized cases but the total case fatality might be underestimated. As of 13 January 2017, 16 pregnant women presenting with AJS have been hospitalized and tested for Hepatitis E, 12 (75%) of them tested positive using the HEV RDT. Of the pregnant women presenting with AJS, four have reportedly died (three had tested positive for Hepatitis E). Approximately 90% of the AJS cases were reported from Am Timan which appears to be the epi-centre of the ongoing outbreak, and most of the cases are identified through active case findings. As of 13 January 2017, AJS cases have been reported from 59 different quartiers in and surrounding Am Timan. ### Public health response The outbreak was detected when two pregnant icteric women were admitted in the Am Timan Regional Hospital, partly supported by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) since 2009. MSF has been responding to the outbreak in support to the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) with a total of 14 expatriate staff and over 400 national staff dedicated to the epidemic response in addition to staff involved in the regular project. MSF provides support in implementing outbreak monitoring, active surveillance, water chlorination and community sensitization in Am Timan.* In addition, World Health Organization (WHO) and the MPH are complementing the initial investigations carried out between 22–29 October 2016 by extending investigations to the whole region in order to identify potential new foci.** WHO country office is also supporting the MPH in passive and active surveillance strengthening outside of Am Timan, developing case definition, surveillance tools, simple case management protocols and testing algorithm, defining criteria for case hospitalization and carrying out needs assessment in and outside the town of Am Timan. WHO is also advocating for additional needed partnerships especially to address the needs in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilisation in Am Timan as in the region.*** ### WHO risk assessment Based on the available information, there appears to be a plateau in the number of cases reported in the past 5 weeks from the affected area with an average of 70 cases reported weekly where only a minor proportion (7.2%) requires hospitalization. The infectious risk seems confined to Am Timan and immediate surroundings. However, the event remains under close monitoring at all levels of WHO. The current level of risk for further spread remains as moderate to high and at local level, and the limited capacity to respond to date calls for additional immediate support, especially in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilisation. ### WHO advice WHO recommends the continuation of the investigations with a specific case definition as to describe the time, place and person characteristics of the outbreak and identify the source. It is important to identify the source of contamination of the surface water and, in the meantime, to ensure water safety by chlorination at the point of use by the population. Travellers to Chad should follow standard hygiene recommendations in terms of water and food safety for travellers. These should protect them against Hepatitis E, as the risk of person to person transmission is very low. * * * ##### CORRIGENDUM *Please note that the first paragraph under the heading ""Public health response"" was added on 30 January 2017. **Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence on 30 January 2017 to add additional information regarding the investigations carried out during October 2016. ***Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence on 30 January 2017 to add additional contextual information regarding the needed partnerships.

1302,"(' On 12 February 2019, the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) received a report regarding surgical site infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa after invasive procedures performed in Tijuana, Mexico. As of 11 February, a total of 20 cases, 16 confirmed and 4 suspected, have been identified in nine states in the United States. As per the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) case definition, a confirmed case is defined as Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase–producing carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (VIM-CRPA) isolated from a patient who had an invasive procedure in Mexico in the month prior to collection of the VIM-CRPA positive specimen. A suspect case is CRPA unavailable for mechanism testing or pending mechanism testing from a patient who had an invasive procedure in Mexico in the month prior to collection of the specimen. Of the 20 total cases, two were reported retrospectively and had dates of specimen collection in 2015 and 2017, while the remaining 18 cases had dates of specimen collection between 5 September 2018 and 24 January 2019. All cases were in travelers who received medical care from healthcare facilities in Tijuana, Mexico. Fifteen of the total cases reported having surgery, primarily for weight loss, at Grand View Hospital. Half of the total cases reported the use of the same medical tourism travel agency based in the United States to coordinate their surgical procedure in Mexico. Although most referred patients were from the United States and Canada, this medical tourism travel agency has reportedly referred patients from additional countries to Grand View Hospital since 1 August 2018. A total of 13 cases have been hospitalized in the United States for complications associated with VIM-CRPA infection following invasive procedures in Mexico; most presented with a surgical site infection. One patient with a bloodstream infection and several underlying comorbidities died. Of the 17 cases with available information on sex and age, 14 (82%) were female, and ages ranged from 29 to 62 years. A local investigation at Grand View Hospital identified reusable equipment that was not being appropriately processed, which poses a small but potential risk of transmission for bloodborne infections among patients. On 9 January 2019, the US-CDC issued a Travel Notice regarding cases of resistant P. aeruginosa infection linked to surgery at Grand View Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, with a recommendation that US residents not undergo surgery (bariatric or other type) at Grand View Hospital until it is confirmed that VIM-CRPA is no longer spreading at the facility. On 22 January 2019, the US- CDC issued a notification recommending that individuals who had surgery at Grand View Hospital on or after 1 August 2018 talk to their healthcare provider about getting tested for the following bloodborne pathogens: hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). On 13 February 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) also issued a Public Health Notice regarding Canadian travelers who may have been exposed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria after having undergone surgical procedures in Tijuana, Mexico. In addition, Canadian travelers who had procedures at Grand View Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, may also be at-risk for bloodborne infections such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Given the possibility of exposure to these health risks, PHAC recommends that patients who have had surgery at Grand View Hospital or other medical facilities in Tijuana, and who are experiencing signs of an infection—such as fever, redness, pus or swelling at the surgical incision site—see a healthcare provider immediately. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their travel to Mexico and all medical care or surgeries they had while they were outside of Canada. ### WHO risk assessment Individuals in the United States with resistant P. aeruginosa infections following invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy) in Mexico have reported undergoing procedures at different healthcare facilities in Tijuana. One facility, Grand View Hospital, is associated with an ongoing outbreak of VIM-producing P. aeruginosa infections. Persons who underwent procedures at this healthcare facility may be infected or at-risk of developing VIM- producing P. aeruginosa infections. There is a risk of spreading resistant P. aeruginosa by patients returning to their home countries, particularly in healthcare settings. A single medical tourism travel agency based in the United States reported referring individuals from different countries to Grand View Hospital since 1 August 2018; however, persons from additional countries may also be affected. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. ### WHO advice WHO encourages sharing this outbreak information with relevant public health authorities and clinicians, to enable timely recognition of potential cases that could be related to this outbreak. WHO recommends implementing infection prevention and control measures, as described in the “Guidelines for the prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in health care facilities”, to prevent the dissemination of multi-drug resistant microorganisms in healthcare settings, available at the link below. As antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, including in the Region of the Americas, WHO encourages States Parties to increase efforts for early detection of resistant microorganisms and to implement prevention and control actions for containing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Surveillance is a key component of prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and should be strengthened, along with laboratory capacity, to support the detection of infection caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria and to inform infection prevention and control practices and antimicrobial stewardship. Treatment policies should be based on both antibiotic susceptibility testing when possible and on the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance when empiric treatment is prescribed. Clinicians must be updated on treatment recommendations as these evolve due to very dynamic changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns. WHO recommends against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Mexico based on the information available for this event. ### For more information: ',)"
1281,"(' On 28 July 2018, the North Kivu Provincial Health Division notified the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a cluster of suspected acute haemorrhagic fever cases. On 1 August 2018, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa reported that four of six samples collected from hospitalised patients tested positive by GeneXpert automated PCR. These presumptive positive tests prompted an immediate escalation of response activities by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, and the declaration of the outbreak by the Minister of Health. The prompt alert by the Ministry of Health to WHO, under the International Health Regulations, followed the detection and rapid investigation of a cluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in a family in North Kivu Province during mid to late July 2018. Local health officials have since identified sporadic, antecedent deaths in the community since May 2018 (tentatively classified as probable cases), which are subject to ongoing investigations to determine if they are related to the current outbreak. The Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are working to establish the full extent of this outbreak. As of 3 August 2018, a total of 43 Ebola virus disease cases (13 confirmed and 30 probable), including 33 deaths, have been reported. An additional 33 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. Three healthcare workers have been affected, of whom one has died. Geographically, confirmed and probable cases are currently localised to five health zones in North Kivu Province (38 cases, including 13 confirmed and 25 probable), and one health zone in Ituri Province (5 probable cases) (Figure 1). Suspected cases are currently under investigation in one additional health zone of Ituri Province. The affected areas host over one million displaced people and shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda, with frequent cross border movement due to trade activities. The prolonged humanitarian crisis and deterioration of the security situation is expected to hinder response to this outbreak. Further laboratory testing by INRB has detected Ebolavirus using conventional PCR in three of the initial batch of six samples from Mabalako Health Zone. These results are highly suggestive that Ebola Zaire species is the cause of this outbreak; however, genetic sequencing is necessary to definitively confirm the virus species. Characterization of viral sequences will help to inform the potential use of vaccines and therapeutics, and any link to the recent outbreak in Équateur Province – located in the far west of the country, some 2 500 km from the current outbreak. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that these events are related. Figure 1: Ebola virus disease by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 3 August 2018 ### Public health response The Ministry of Health has initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. In addition, the potential for use of Ebola vaccines, as well as therapeutics for treatment of Ebola virus disease, are being reviewed. * The Ministry of Health and WHO have deployed Rapid Response Teams to the affected health zones to initiate response activities. * WHO has activated country, regional and global coordination mechanisms to assess risks and respond accordingly to the event. An incident management team has been established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and support teams have been reactivated at the WHO Regional Office for Africa and at headquarters. Coordination meetings with Ministry of Health and partners were held on 1 August 2018 for deployment of human resources and material. Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established, and a full response plan is being developed. * WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and partners in the activation of a multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response. * With support of international partners, Ebola treatment centres are being established in Mangina, Beni and Goma. * A mobile laboratory has been established in Beni to facilitate timely diagnoses of suspected cases. The establishment of additional laboratory capacities elsewhere is being explored. * Contact tracing activities have been initiated. Thus far, 879 contacts have been registered for follow-up. * The Regional Emergency Director for Africa has informed neighbouring countries (Rwanda and Uganda) of the outbreak and emphasized the importance of surveillance and preparedness actions, especially along the border. * Activities to sensitize communities to the outbreak, and hygiene and sanitation measures, through media and churches have begun in affected communities, and in neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda. * On 1 August, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Operational Support Team has issued an alert to its network partners, providing an overview of the current situation and ongoing response activities. On 2 August, the GOARN Steering Committee and WHO Regional Office for Africa conducted a joint coordination call for operational partners in Africa. GOARN partners continue to contribute to response activities. ### WHO risk assessment This new outbreak of Ebola virus disease is affecting north eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk is considered high at the national and regional levels and low globally. ### WHO advice As investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries to ensure health authorities are alerted and prepared to respond. WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

Meningococcal disease. As with all types of meningococcal disease, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group W135 meningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease: sudden onset of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting, photophobia and stiff neck. The most severe clinical form of the disease, meningococcal septicaemia can be presented by abrupt onset, high fever, petechial rash or purpura. WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close contacts of the cases, such as persons sleeping in the same dwelling. In most countries rifampicin is recommended. In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next year, the Ministry of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries of Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive, that the vaccination against meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y and W135) has been added to the health requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj. WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely monitor meningococcal disease. In order to fully identify and follow the epidemiological spread of the W135 strain, WHO encourages countries to send specimens to WHO Collaborating Centres for Meningococcal Infections.

1002,"(' 11 February 2013 - The United Kingdom (UK) has informed WHO of a confirmed case with infection of the novel coronavirus (NCoV). The case is a UK resident who developed symptoms of illness on 26 January 2013. Laboratory investigations on respiratory specimens have revealed both an Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and a confirmed NCoV infection. He is hospitalized in intensive care unit. Preliminary investigation reveals that the patient had a history of travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Further investigation into the case is ongoing. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has instituted stringent infection control measures around the patient and identified contacts who may have been exposed to the patient during his illness. This is a sporadic case and does not alter the current WHO risk assessment on NCoV but the new case does indicate that the virus is persistent. As of 11 February 2013, a total of 10 confirmed cases of human infection with a novel coronavirus have been notified to WHO. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Testing for the new coronavirus of patients with unexplained pneumonias, or patients with severe, progressive or complicated illness not responding to treatment, should be considered especially in persons residing in or returning from the Arabian peninsula and neighboring countries. Any clusters of SARI or SARI in health care workers should be thoroughly investigated, regardless of where in the world they occur. New human cases and clusters should be promptly reported both to national health authorities and to WHO. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions are applied. ',)"
