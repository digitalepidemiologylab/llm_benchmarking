    "0": "Alright, let's take a look at the user's query. They want me to determine the stance towards vaccination from a given Facebook text. The stance can be PRO, ANTI, or NON. The example provided is the text: \"Could it be that the sleeping giant is awakening? :)\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text. The phrase \"the sleeping giant is awakening\" is often used metaphorically. In political contexts, it might refer to the general public waking up to an issue. The smiley face at the end suggests a positive or hopeful tone.\n\nNext, considering the context of vaccination. The user is asking for the stance regardless of the overall sentiment. So even if the sentiment is positive, the stance might be different. But in this case, the text doesn't explicitly mention vaccination. It's a metaphor without clear indicators of support or opposition.\n\nI should look at the possible interpretations. If \"sleeping giant\" refers to the public recognizing the importance of vaccination, that would lean towards PRO. Alternatively, it could be about anything, so without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that the text doesn't directly relate to vaccination or express a clear opinion on it, the stance would be NON. There's no explicit support or opposition shown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "1": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance the user has towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user is specifying that regardless of the general sentiment, we have to determine if it's pro, anti, or neutral. \n\nLooking at the text, the user mentions that their kids never get sick and attributes this to not having their immune systems compromised by chemicals from vaccines. They also say their kids are healthy because of eating well and living cleanly. The pediatrician is calling to schedule shots, but the user is refusing with \"NO!\" and shows frustration.\n\nSo, while the general sentiment might be negative towards the pediatrician's requests, the stance on vaccination is clearly negative because they're avoiding vaccines and blaming them for compromised immune systems. They are against vaccination, so that's an anti stance.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. The user expresses frustration towards the pediatrician's requests for vaccination, using \"NO!\" to refuse.\n2._attributes their children's health to not being vaccinated and avoiding chemicals.\n3. This indicates a negative stance towards vaccination.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "2": "Alright, so I need to figure out the user's stance on vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user provided a query where they want just the stance, without any explanations, and to format it as a JSON with 'stance' as the key, using 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. \n\nLooking at the example, the user mentioned that their cat wasn't vaccinated except for the first rabies shot and that the cat is healthy. They contrast this with their other pets who were vaccinated but had issues. So, it seems like the user is supporting not vaccinating the cat beyond the required rabies. That leans towards an 'ANTI' stance. \n\nI should make sure not to consider the overall sentiment but focus solely on the vaccination part. In this case, the positive outcome (healthy cat) is attributed to not vaccinating more, indicating an anti-vaccine perspective.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}",
    "3": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance the user has towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user wrote, \"Explain? it's called a booster folks...\". First, I'll break this down. The user seems to be correcting someone or clarifying something. The mention of a \"booster\" indicates they're talking about a vaccine booster shot.\n\nNow, \"booster\" in this context is a positive term related to vaccination because it suggests the importance of getting additional doses. The user might be encouraging others to get vaccinated or to understand the booster's role. Since they're explaining or clarifying, it shows they're in support of the idea. There's no negative language here, just informative and affirmative.\n\nAlso, the user is addressing \"folks,\" which could mean they're trying to inform a group or correct a misconception. This approach is typically done by someone who is pro-vaccination. There's no hesitation or negative sentiment expressed; it's more about spreading accurate information.\n\nPutting it all together, the stance here is supportive of vaccination, specifically regarding booster shots. The user isn't indifferent or negative; they're proactive in explaining the importance. So, the stance should be classified as PRO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "4": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out the stance the user has towards vaccination based on the given Facebook text. The text is a comment from a user who shared a link to a 2012 blog post by Lindsey Williams, with the comment stating: \"DR. You must hear this one....on the economy...\"\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the comment. The user is tagging a doctor and urging them to hear something related to the economy. The link provided is to a blog post titled \"Issues Dire Warning,\" which from what I recall, was about economic collapse predictions. \n\nHowever, the user didn't mention anything about vaccination directly. The context is about the economy, not health or vaccines. Since the prompt asks specifically about the stance towards vaccination, I should check if the user's words or the linked content have any implications on vaccination.\n\nLooking deeper, Lindsey Williams' post is about economic warnings, not vaccination. There's no mention of vaccines, health, or medical topics in the link. Therefore, the user's comment doesn't express any opinion or stance regarding vaccination.\n\nSince the user didn't comment on vaccination at all, their stance is neutral regarding this topic. They were discussing the economy, so there's no positive, negative, or neutral stance specifically about vaccination expressed here.\n\nSo, the appropriate stance is 'NON' because there's no indication or mention of vaccination in the provided text. The comment is entirely focused on the economy, so it doesn't provide any information about the user's vaccination stance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The user provided a text, and I have to determine if their stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON, regardless of the general sentiment. Then, I have to format the answer as a JSON with the key \"stance\".\n\nLooking at the provided text: \"Yep, that is why 'finding a cure for cancer', nowadays is called 'making cancer a manageable decease', creating long term income and profits.\"\n\nFirst, I notice that the text is talking about cancer treatment, not vaccination. The author is commenting on how cancer treatment has shifted from seeking a cure to managing the disease, which generates long-term income and profits for the pharmaceutical industry, I suppose.\n\nNow, the user is asking to determine the stance towards vaccination. Since the text is about cancer treatment, there's no direct mention of vaccines. The user might be making a general comment about the healthcare industry's profit motives, but without explicit reference to vaccines, there's no clear stance on vaccination.\n\nTherefore, the stance towards vaccination in this text is neutral, which is represented by \"NON\". So, the JSON response should be {\"stance\": \"NON\"}\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",
    "6": "Okay, so I need to figure out the user's stance towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user in this case shared a text expressing their feelings about a 2-month-old baby being hospitalized for severe seizures. The user mentions getting a prayer card for their healthcare plan and expresses that they're not surprised about the situation. They then speculate that the vaccines the baby received might have been a factor, calling it a preventable tragedy.\n\nFirst, I should identify the key parts of the text that indicate their stance. The user started by saying they're not surprised, suggesting they might have expected this kind of outcome. Then, they link the baby's seizures to the vaccines, which is a direct reference to vaccination. They also describe the situation as a tragedy that's preventable, which likely refers to avoiding vaccination.\n\nNow, considering the possible stances: PRO, ANTI, or NON. PRO would mean they support vaccination, ANTI means they oppose it, and NON is neutral. The user is openly suggesting that vaccines might have caused the baby's condition, which is a negative view towards vaccines. While their general sentiment about the baby's situation is negative, as the note mentions, their stance towards vaccination could still be negative. So, the user is expressing a negative stance towards vaccination by implying that vaccines are harmful and cause preventable issues.\n\nTherefore, the stance should be ANTI.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Statements:** The user links the baby's seizures to recent vaccinations and describes the situation as a preventable tragedy.\n2. **Interpret Sentiment Towards Vaccines:** The user speculates negatively about vaccines causing harm, indicating opposition.\n3. **Determine Stance:** Based on negative speculation about vaccines, the stance is ANTI.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}",
    "7": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to determine the stance on vaccination from a given Facebook text. They've specified to use 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO' without considering the general sentiment. So I have to focus solely on the stance towards vaccination.\n\nThe text provided is: \"Pan is such a liar. He knows exactly what is being said on his page.\" \n\nHmm, I need to figure out if this relates to vaccination. The person is talking about someone named Pan being a liar, who is aware of what's being said on his page. But there's nothing here about vaccines, health, or medical topics. It's more about accusing someone of deceit regarding their page content.\n\nSince there's no mention of vaccination or any related topics, the stance towards vaccination isn't addressed. Therefore, the appropriate response is 'NON' for neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "8": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance of the user towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user's message here is pretty brief: \".. . . .In words you might understand.\" followed by \"BYE.\" \n\nFirst, I should analyze the content of the text. The user seems a bit dismissive or maybe even frustrated. They start with a series of dots, which could indicate impatience or lack of interest. Then they say, \"In words you might understand,\" which might be a sarcastic comment, suggesting that the other party isn't getting it or is using too complicated language. \n\nThe user then says \"BYE,\" which is a termination of the conversation. It doesn't add any specific information about vaccination. So, the text is short and not directly talking about vaccination. It's more about communication styles or possibly ending the discussion.\n\nNow, the instruction is to determine the stance regardless of general sentiment. The stance can be PRO, NON, or ANTI. But the user didn't express any opinions about vaccination. They're just ending the conversation, so there's no indication of whether they're pro or anti-vaccination.\n\nTherefore, the stance should be NON, as there's no expressed opinion on vaccination in the text. The user isn't taking a side but is rather wrapping up the conversation without any stance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "9": "Alright, I need to determine the stance towards vaccination based on the user's Facebook text. The instruction specifies to look only at the stance, regardless of the general sentiment. The user's text is \"thank you, great links!\" \n\nFirst, I analyze the content. The phrase expresses gratitude and appreciation, but it doesn't mention vaccination directly. Since there's no explicit reference to vaccination, I can't infer a positive, negative, or neutral stance towards it. \n\nNext, considering the requirement, the stance must be one of NON, ANTI, or PRO. Without any indication about vaccination, the correct stance is neutral, which is 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",
    "10": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the stance the user has towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user provided a sample text: \"SCRUTINIZE EVERY MS vaccine and drugs please. ALARM BELLS will be ringing.\" The task is to determine if the stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON (neutral), regardless of the overall sentiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the text. The user is urging others to \"scrutinize\" every MS vaccine and drugs. The use of \"ALARM BELLS\" suggests concern or caution. The word \"scrutinize\" indicates a call for careful examination, which could imply skepticism or doubt about the vaccines and drugs.\n\nLooking at the phrasing, \"ALARM BELLS will be ringing\" is a strong metaphor often used to express worry or foreboding. This could suggest that the user is warning others about potential issues with vaccines, which might indicate an anti-vaccine stance.\n\nThe key here is to focus on the stance towards vaccination, not the overall sentiment. Even if the text feels strongly worded, the stance is about support or opposition.\n\nSince the user is calling for scrutiny and uses alarm bells, it's leaning towards caution or negativity about vaccines. Therefore, the stance is likely ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "11": "Alright, I need to determine the stance of the user towards vaccination based on their Facebook post. The user's text is: \"This makes me sick to stomach!!! It's all about money!!!\". \n\nFirst, I'll look for any explicit mentions of vaccination. The text doesn't mention vaccination directly, so that's a point towards a neutral stance.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the sentiment. The user is clearly upset, using strong language like \"sick to stomach\" and exclamation marks. The phrase \"all about money\" could imply they're frustrated with motives behind something, possibly vaccination policies or the vaccine industry. \n\nSince the user didn't explicitly state their stance on vaccination, even though their sentiment is negative, I can't definitively categorize it as ANTI. Without a direct mention, it's safer to go with a neutral stance. \n\nTherefore, the stance is likely neutral, so the answer is NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}\n```",

Parents must take the CO route and protect their kids. Meanwhile, get active in anti-vaccine groups since the PTB really do want mandatory vaccines or the kids will be given over to foster homes.\"\n\nFirst, I notice that the user is using strong language against Big Pharma, calling it a travesty. They're suggesting that parents should take the \"CO route,\" which might stand for \"Conscientious Objection\" or some other alternative, implying a refusal to vaccinate. The mention of getting active in anti-vaccine groups is a direct indicator of opposition to vaccines. They also express concern about mandatory vaccines and the potential consequences, like kids being taken into foster care, which suggests a negative view of vaccination policies.\n\nThe general sentiment here is clearly negative, with the user advocating against vaccination. There's no positive or neutral language about vaccines; instead, they're warning parents to take action against them. So, the stance is against vaccination.\n</think>\n\nThe user’s text strongly opposes vaccination, warning against Big Pharma and encouraging anti-vaccine activism, indicating a negative stance. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The user's text is: \"when will people understand that immunity and health come from proper healthy food and lifestyle, and not from a shot\". \n\nFirst, analyzing the message. The user is emphasizing that immunity and health are derived from food and lifestyle rather than a shot, which is likely referring to vaccines. They are questioning why people don't understand this, suggesting a negative view towards vaccines. The phrasing \"not from a shot\" directly contrasts natural methods with vaccination, implying opposition to vaccines. \n\nThe stance options are NON, ANTI, or PRO. The text clearly opposes vaccination by suggesting that it's not the source of immunity, so the stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "14": "Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user shared a Facebook post about their mother developing shingles, which led to her being out of work for three months and unable to walk. The mother wasn't vaccinated and now advises others not to get the vaccine. \n\nSo, the user is recounting a negative experience with the shingles vaccine—specifically, their mother's experience. The mother's stance is clearly against the vaccine, advising others against it. The user isn't directly giving their opinion, but they're sharing their mother's negative experience.\n\nNow, the task is to determine the user's stance towards the vaccine, regardless of the general sentiment. The options are PRO, ANTI, or NON. \n\nLooking at the text, the user is emphasizing the negative outcome their mother faced due to not getting vaccinated, and the mother's anti-vaccine advice. While the user doesn't explicitly state their stance, sharing this experience might imply they agree or at least lean towards the mother's opinion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is neutral and just sharing a story without taking a side. However, the mother's strong recommendation against the vaccine is a significant part of the narrative, which might suggest the user has a negative stance towards the vaccine.\n\nBut wait, the user didn't express their own opinion; they're recounting their mother's experience. So, without the user's direct opinion, it's tricky. Maybe the user's stance is neutral, just reporting a story, which would be NON.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, the user is presenting a negative outcome and a mother advising against the vaccine. On the other, the user isn't stating their own stance. To avoid assuming, perhaps they are neutral. So, the stance could be NON.\n\nWait, but the user is sharing this as a cautionary tale. Maybe they support the mother's anti-vaccine stance, which would make the stance ANTI. Or perhaps they are implying the opposite, that the vaccine is beneficial, given the negative outcome. But the user doesn't say that.\n\nI think, based on the information, the user is showing a negative outcome, which might lean towards a stance against vaccination, hence ANTI. Alternatively, maybe just reporting without taking a side, which would be NON.\n\nWait, the instructions say to look for the stance regardless of general sentiment. The mother's experience is negative, and she advises against it. The user shares this, so their stance is likely ANTI. Because they're presenting it as a reason not to get vaccinated. That makes the most sense. So, the stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}",
    "15": "Alright, let's break down what the user is asking here. They want me to determine the stance of a user towards vaccination based on a given Facebook text. The stance can be positive (PRO), negative (ANTI), or neutral (NON). Importantly, the general sentiment of the text doesn't affect the stance determination—the user's stance is to be assessed regardless of whether the text is positive or negative overall.\n\nLooking at the text provided: \"Breaks my heart! I am so sorry for her.\" This text expresses empathy or sorrow, likely towards someone who's experiencing a negative situation. However, it doesn't mention anything about vaccination. Without any direct reference to vaccines or related topics, there's no indication of the user's stance on vaccination. \n\nSo, my reasoning is that since there's no mention or indication of the user's opinion on vaccination, the stance must be neutral. Even though the sentiment is negative, it's unrelated to vaccination. Therefore, the correct stance classification here is 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

Hmm, the text given is \"But the school district won't tell you that!!! I've had to 'school' a school nurse more than once.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person is frustrated because the school district isn't informing them properly and they've had to educate a school nurse. The word 'school' is in quotes, implying they had to teach or inform her. \n\nNow, thinking about vaccination stance. The user is emphasizing that they had to educate someone else, which suggests that maybe the school's information was lacking or incorrect. It could imply that the user is knowledgeable and perhaps supports vaccination, given that they had to correct someone. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the missing information is about risks or alternative viewpoints. The frustration doesn't directly state vaccination stance, but contextually, 'schooling' a nurse might indicate they have strong opinions. \n\nConsidering the options: is it Neutral (NON), Anti (ANTI), or Pro (PRO)? The stance isn't explicitly about vaccination, but the act of correcting the nurse could suggest they are advocating for vaccination, hence Pro. However, without clear mention, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the initial example response was \"ANTI\". Oh, perhaps because the user is frustrated with the school's stance, which might be pro-vaccination, so the user is against it. Alternatively, maybe the user feels the school isn't providing enough pro-vaccination info, making them pro.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But since the user had to school the nurse, maybe they are pro because they provided correct info. So, should the stance be PRO? But in the initial example, it was marked as ANTI. Maybe the frustration is due to not being informed, which could lean towards the user opposing the school's pro-vaccination policies.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is not explicitly stating their stance but giving an example where they had to correct someone. If they're correcting anti-vax info, they would be pro. If they're correcting pro-vax info, they could be anti. But without knowing, it's hard. Since the user's frustration is about not being told something, and they had to correct the nurse, perhaps it's ANTI if the user is opposing the school's stance, which is likely pro, so they must be anti to feel the need to correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the school is promoting vaccination, and the user had to correct the nurse by providing more pro info, then they'd be pro. But without context, it's difficult.\n\nBut looking back at the example response, it was ANTI, so maybe the assistant concluded the user had an anti stance. Perhaps the user feels that the school isn't providing enough information, which they had to correct, implying the user is anti-vax and had to provide correct (anti) info to the nurse.\n\nSo, contextually, maybe the answer is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}",

The user wrote, \"Yes people want convenience and revolutionary types reward is change.\" Hmm, this doesn't directly mention vaccination, but I need to assess their stance regardless of the overall sentiment.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. \"People want convenience\" - that's pretty neutral. Convenience could relate to many things, not necessarily vaccines. \"Revolutionary types reward is change.\" This seems more abstract. It might be a positive statement about change, but it's not clear how it relates to vaccination.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of vaccines or any related terms, it's tough to determine a clear stance. The sentiment of the text is positive in a general sense, but without context, it's impossible to tie it to a positive or negative view on vaccination. The user isn't showing support or opposition; they're just making a statement about change and convenience in a broad sense.\n\nGiven all this, the stance is likely neutral. There's no indication of being for or against vaccination. So, the stance should be NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I should analyze the content of the message. The phrase \"Look out sushi Australia\" doesn't explicitly mention vaccination. It seems like the user is talking about sushi in Australia, maybe a warning or a tip about something related to sushi there. But how does that relate to vaccinations?\n\nNow, considering the context, Facebook posts can sometimes be about health topics, but here it's about sushi. Unless there's some implied health risk, but that doesn't directly tie into vaccination. So, it's possible the user is simply sharing information about sushi in Australia, without any connection to vaccines.\n\nSince there's no mention of vaccines, pro-vaccine statements, or anti-vaccine arguments, the stance is likely neutral. The user isn't expressing support or opposition to vaccination here. They're just making a statement about sushi.\n\nI should also think about whether there's any implied sentiment. The phrase \"look out\" could imply a warning, but without more context, it's unclear if that warning is about something related to health or just general advice about sushi. Even if it were a health warning, unless it specifically mentions vaccination, it doesn't help determine the stance.\n\nSo, putting it all together: no explicit mention of vaccination, neutral topic about sushi, lack of pro or anti cues. Therefore, the stance is neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The user is talking about a website for liberty candidates, which seems to be a political topic. They’re asking about candidates and free advertising, not directly mentioning vaccines at all. \n\nThere are no references to health, medicine, or any terms related to vaccination. The focus is on political candidates and their advertising. Since the text doesn't touch on any aspects of vaccination, it's neutral in that regard. \n\nI need to choose between 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. Since there's no mention or implication of a stance towards vaccination, the correct choice is 'NON'.

The user wrote, \"Perhaps the doctor who questions whether the increased number of medical exemptions are warranted should consider that previously one could be medically exempt but choose a personal belief exemption instead.\" \n\nHmm, so the user is talking about doctors questioning medical exemptions and suggesting they might consider the shift from personal belief to medical exemptions. This doesn't seem to directly express a positive or negative opinion about vaccination. Instead, it's pointing out a change in exemption choices, which could be seen as a neutral observation about trends in medical exemptions. \n\nThe user isn't clearly supporting vaccination (PRO) or opposing it (ANTI). They're moreneutral, discussing the dynamics around exemptions without taking a side on the effectiveness or safety of vaccines. Therefore, the stance here is likely neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The word \"fight\" indicates resistance, and \"BEFORE mandates\" implies taking action against implementation of vaccine requirements. This leans towards an anti-vaccination stance because it's advocating against强制措施, which are often related to vaccination policies.\n\nI don't see any positive language about vaccines here. Instead, it's about opposing mandates, which is typically a stance against vaccination requirements. Therefore, the user's stance is likely ANTI.\n</think>\n\nThe user's stance is ANTI because they are opposed to vaccine mandates, indicating resistance to vaccination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

They also mention liking to use Pinterest. \n\nNow, I have to determine if this text expresses a stance on vaccination. The options are PRO, ANTI, or NON (neutral). \n\nThe user didn't mention anything about vaccines or vaccination in the text. They are talking about closing their Pinterest accounts, possibly due to some reason, but since it's not specified, we can't assume. The user also mentions liking to use Pinterest, which is about their preference for the platform, not directly related to vaccines.\n\nSince there's no mention or implication about vaccination, it doesn't express a positive or negative stance.

The user is talking about \"Amerika,\" which is a play on words, possibly referencing current events or politics in America. \n\nLooking at the sentiment of the text, it's clearly negative because of the words \"joke\" and \"Amerika\" which might imply dissatisfaction or frustration with something. However, the task is to determine the stance towards vaccination regardless of the general sentiment. \n\nI recall the user might have made a previous statement about vaccination, but in this text, \"Amerika\" and \"joke\" don't explicitly mention vaccines or vaccination. It seems more like a political(comment) or a frustration towards the state of affairs. \n\nSo, there's no direct mention of vaccination here. The user is expressing a negative sentiment about something else (maybe the state of the country), but since vaccination isn't directly addressed, I can't infer a positive or negative stance towards it. \n\nTherefore, the stance is neutral, which is represented by 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

It doesn't explicitly mention vaccination, but if I assume the context is vaccination (since the task is about stance towards vaccination), then the question is about whether a certain measure overrides a specific law.\n\nI need to figure out if the stance is positive, negative, or neutral towards vaccination. The question doesn't express a clear opinion either for or against vaccination. It's more of a neutral inquiry about legal implications. There's no indication of support or opposition here. \n\nTherefore, the stance is likely neutral.

Therefore, the appropriate stance in this case is neutral, which is denoted by 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}\n```",

The text the user provided is: \"Well, what do you expect??!!!\". \n\nFirst, I look at the sentiment. The text seems negative because of the multiple question marks and exclamation points. But the instruction says to focus on the stance regardless of overall sentiment. So, even if the sentiment is negative, the stance could be positive, neutral, or negative.\n\nLooking closely, the user didn't mention anything specific about vaccines. They just expressed frustration. Without any direct reference to vaccination, it's hard to tell if they support it or not. \n\nI think the best stance is 'NON' because there's no indication of a positive or negative opinion about vaccination. They're just expressing surprise or anger about something else, not specifically about vaccines.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

It seems like the user is calling someone an idiot without context.\n\nNext, I should consider if the negative sentiment towards \"Becca\" relates to vaccination. Without more information, it's hard to tell. The user's frustration might be about something else entirely unrelated to vaccines.\n\nSince there's no clear indication of support or opposition to vaccination, the stance should be neutral. However, because of the negative sentiment expressed towards a person, it might lean towards ANTI, but it's not specific enough.\n\nI think the safest stance here is NON, as there's no direct evidence of the user's opinion on vaccination.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The text is talking about whistleblower cases taking a long time and being complex. There's no direct mention of vaccines, vaccination, or related topics. The discussion is about the legal or procedural aspects of whistleblowing.\n\nSince there's no indication of the user's opinion on vaccination, I can't infer a stance. The user isn't expressing support or opposition; they're simply stating facts about whistleblower cases. Therefore, the stance towards vaccination isn't addressed here. \n\nI should also consider if the context could imply anything about vaccination. Whistleblower cases could be about various issues, not necessarily vaccines. Without specific details linking the text to vaccination, I can't determine a stance.\n\nSo, the user's stance is neither pro nor anti-vaccine. It's neutral regarding vaccination. Thus, the stance should be 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",

The user uses strong words like \"disgusting\" and talks about people in the field looking at their ethics, implying criticism. They also mention people being injured because of greed, which is a clear negative sentiment towards pharmaceutical companies.\n\nNow, the query specifically asks for the stance towards vaccination, not just the sentiment towards Big Pharma. However, in this context, since Big Pharma is closely associated with producing vaccines, the negative stance towards them often reflects a negative view of vaccination. The person is upset about the consequences of pharmaceutical actions, which can include vaccinations, especially if they believe these companies are unethical.\n\nEven though the text doesn't explicitly mention vaccines, the strong anti-Pharma sentiment suggests an ANTI stance towards their products, likely including vaccines. So, the stance here would be ANTI.\n</think>\n\nThe user expresses strong negative sentiment towards pharmaceutical companies, suggesting a negative stance towards vaccination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The instruction is to use only NON, ANTI, or PRO. \n\nLooking at the text: \"Oh and btw - they won't take a baby from their parent(s) for not doing vaccines!\" The person is mentioning that authorities aren't taking babies away due to not vaccinating. So, the implication is that people shouldn't worry about that consequence. \n\nI think this shows support for vaccination because they're dismissing a potential fear, suggesting that vaccines are safe and not leading to such extreme actions.

The user's message is about疫苗接种，但看起来并没有直接提到疫苗或者接种的态度。他们谈的是疫苗研发机构的会员情况，说大多数会员是免费给医学生，真正付钱的很少，还说了“很好”。\n\n首先，用户评论的是一个疫苗研发机构的会员结构。他们提到免费给医学生，并且认为真正付钱的人很少，这可能表达了对该机构运营方式的看法。但是，这并没有直接关联到疫苗本身或者接种的态度。\n\n接下来，分析用户的情感是怎样的。用户用了“Good.”这个词，看起来有点正面的情感，但这是在对会员结构的评论上。他们觉得机构给医学生免费是好的，可能认为这样做有助于培养未来的医疗人才，但并不直接涉及疫苗的好坏。\n\n因此，用户的发言中并没有明确表达对疫苗接种的支持或反对。他们讨论的是一个疫苗研发机构的结构，而不是疫苗本身。所以，尽管用户对会员结构有积极的评价，但这并不等于对疫苗接种持有正面或者支持的立场。\n\n综合来看，用户并没有明确表达对疫苗接种的看法，更多的是一种中立或无关的态度。所以，他们的立场应该是中立的，也就是NON。\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

I would’ve more than flinched!\"\n\nFirst, I notice the exclamation points and the word \"Good,\" which suggests a positive emotion. The user is expressing satisfaction about someone flinching. The phrase \"I would’ve more than flinched\" implies that the user had a stronger reaction than just flinching.\n\nBut wait, flinching is usually a response to something unexpected or unpleasant, like getting a shot. So, if someone flinches when getting a vaccine, it's a natural reaction. The user is glad about that flinch, which might indicate they support vaccination because the flinch is a sign of a vaccine being administered.\n\nHowever, could there be another interpretation? Maybe the user is upset about something else, but the way it's phrased seems positive. They're glad the person flinched, which might be in the context of a vaccination. The user also says they would have flinched more, adding to the support.\n\nI should consider if there's any negative sentiment. The text doesn't mention any concerns about the vaccine itself, just the reaction. So, the stance is likely positive towards vaccination.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "34": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out the stance the user took towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The instruction says to look at their stance regardless of the general sentiment. So even if the text seems negative overall, the stance could be positive, and vice versa.\n\nThe text given is: \"Another reason not to vac\". The word \"vac\" is likely a typo or abbreviation for \"vaccine\". So, the user is providing another reason to not get vaccinated. \n\nIn this case, the user is explicitly stating a reason against vaccination. The phrase \"not to vac\" clearly indicates a negative stance. It suggests that the user is against vaccination. \n\nSo, even though the overall text might be expressing a reason in a certain way, the content is clearly anti-vaccination. Therefore, the stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}\n```",
    "35": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance towards vaccination in the given Facebook text: \"and rabies is the only disease vaccinated against (in ppl and animals) that is always fatal.\" Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that rabies is the only disease vaccinated against that is always fatal. So they are stating a fact about rabies. They're pointing out that vaccination is done for rabies, and it's because it's always fatal. This seems to be an informative statement rather than a direct opinion.\n\nThe user isn't explicitly saying whether they support or oppose vaccination. Instead, they're providing information about rabies and its vaccination. The stance might be neutral because the statement is more of an observation without a clear positive or negative leaning towards vaccination itself.\n\nAlternatively, could this imply a pro-vaccination stance? Because by stating that rabies is vaccinated against, and given that it's fatal, it might be seen as supporting vaccination as an effective measure. But I'm not sure if that's a strong enough implication because the user isn't expressing an opinion but just stating a fact.\n\nWait, maybe the mention of rabies being always fatal could be highlighting the necessity of vaccination, which might lean towards a pro stance. But again, the user isn't advising or expressing support, just stating information.\n\nI'm leaning towards neutral because the user isn't clearly expressing support for or against vaccination. They're just providing factual information without any explicit opinion or recommendation.\n\nSo the stance is probably non.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

They also emphasized not to invent anything and to base it on the text provided, regardless of the general sentiment.\n\nLooking at the message, the user wrote, \"When will all the episodes be on DVD?\" On the surface, this seems like a question about releasing TV episodes on DVD. It's asking about availability and timing. Nowhere in this text does the user mention anything about vaccines, diseases,接种政策, or any related issues. \n\nSince the text is about DVDs and doesn't touch on vaccination at all, it's clear that the user isn't expressing any stance—positive, negative, or neutral—on the topic. They’re simply inquiring about the release of episodes. \n\nSo, based on the guidelines, since there's no mention or indication of vaccination, the stance should be neutral, which is 'NON'. That's the appropriate response here. There's no anti or pro sentiment because the text is unrelated to the subject in question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

Also, the response needs to be in JSON format without any explanations.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given examples in the query to understand the pattern. The initial example had a user expressing thanks for the information and a brief comment about wondering something. The stance was determined as 'NON' because the user's sentiment wasn't clear or leaning either way.\n\nNow, the user provides another example where the text is \"thank you I wondered.\" Let's parse this. The author is thanking someone, which is a positive action, but the sentiment towards vaccination isn't explicitly stated. They also mention \"I wondered,\" which indicates curiosity or uncertainty. There's no clear support or opposition to vaccination here.\n\nSo, I need to apply the same logic from the examples. Since the text doesn't express a clear positive or negative sentiment towards vaccination, the stance is neutral, which corresponds to 'NON.'\n\nI should ensure that I don't add any explanations or invent any stance beyond what's indicated in the text. The response must be a JSON with only the key 'stance' and its value.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct stance for \"thank you I wondered\" is 'NON', and the JSON should reflect that without any additional information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}\n```",

The task is to determine if the stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON (neutral), regardless of the general sentiment of the text. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the message. The user says \"Great read!!\" which is a positive sentiment towards whatever they're reading. However, the names listed (Scott Myers, Colby, Sheyenne, Shelby, Sam Meadows, Lana Meadows) don't seem related to vaccination. They could be names of people, possibly friends or family, but without context, it's hard to tell. \n\nSince the text is just a positive reaction to a reading material without any direct mentions of vaccination, I can't infer a stance. The mention of names doesn't provide any clues about their views on vaccination. The sentiment is positive towards the reading, but that doesn't translate to a stance on vaccination. \n\nTherefore, the stance is neutral, so the answer should be \"NON\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

They mention using natural soap for years and sharing simple recipes. I don't see any mention of vaccination here. They're talking about cleaning methods, not health or medical topics.\n\nSo, the user is sharing tips on natural cleaning solutions. That doesn't indicate any stance towards vaccination. They're neutral on the topic since it's not addressed at all.\n\nI should make sure I'm focusing solely on the stance towards vaccination and not the overall sentiment. Since there's no discussion about vaccines, shots, or health policies, the stance is neutral.\n\nTherefore, the stance is 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

These are all entities commonly associated with vaccine development and distribution. The use of the phrase \"Working hard for our health\" suggests approval or support for their efforts. \n\nEven though the general sentiment might vary, the user is specifically highlighting the positive contributions of these organizations.

The sentence is basically providing information about the lack of established data in specific groups. It doesn't express a clear opinion or recommendation. There's no indication of approval or disapproval of the vaccine itself; rather, it's stating a fact about the available evidence.\n\nSince the text isn't encouraging vaccination or discouraging it, but merely stating that certain groups haven't been studied enough, the stance doesn't fall into the 'PRO' or 'ANTI' categories. It's more of a neutral piece of information, pointing out an unknown aspect of the vaccine's effects on these populations.\n\nTherefore, the stance is neutral, indicated by 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The user ends by calling the organization \"amazing,\" which suggests support.\n\nNow, considering the possible stances: PRO, ANTI, or NON. The text doesn't directly mention vaccination, but CCHR is known for opposing forced vaccination and psychiatric medications. The mention of fighting state requirements about giving kids meds likely includes vaccines. The user's support for this organization indicates they are against mandatory vaccination, hence an ANTI stance.\n\nTherefore, the stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\nThe user's support for an organization opposing forced medication, likely including vaccines, shows an ANTI stance towards vaccination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The user mentioned being bullied by hospital staff to receive an MMR booster for future pregnancies. Then they noted that two months later, they had their first symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis.\n\nHmm, first, I think about what \"bullying\" implies here. The user feels pressured, maybe even forced, to get the vaccine. That doesn't sound positive. They didn't express a willingness or eagerness, instead, it's portrayed as an unpleasant experience. \n\nThen, the user connects the vaccine to the onset of Ulcerative Colitis. This could imply they believe the vaccine caused or contributed to their health issue. If someone thinks a vaccine made them sick, they're likely against it, right? They might be warning others or expressing concern about the safety of vaccinations.\n\nLooking at the prompt again, I need to determine the stance as either ANTI, PRO, or NON (neutral). Even though the general sentiment of the text might be negative (because of being bullied and having health issues), the stance towards vaccination isn't necessarily the same. But in this case, the connection made between the vaccine and health problems suggests a negative stance. They're recounting a bad experience and linking it to a health issue, which probably means they're against vaccines.\n\nSo, the stance here is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The key points here are the mention of it being a \"good article\" and that it discusses both sides.\n\nSo, since the text describes the article as good and talks about both sides without taking a clear pro or anti stance, it's leaning towards being neutral.

The user provided a text that says, \"Not ethical in the least.\" My task is to determine if this expresses a PRO, ANTI, or NON stance towards vaccination, regardless of the general sentiment.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the text. The phrase \"Not ethical in the least\" seems to convey a negative opinion. The word \"Not\" is a negation, and \"ethical\" relates to morality. So the user is saying something is unethical, which implies they disapprove.\n\nNow, considering the context, the user is talking about vaccination. When someone says a vaccination practice isn't ethical, they're likely expressing opposition. This suggests an anti-vaccination stance because they're criticizing the ethics, possibly related to safety, efficacy, or other concerns.\n\nI also need to think about why someone would use the word \"ethical.\" This could relate to concerns about vaccinated individuals, side effects, or other moral issues surrounding vaccine distribution or use.

The word \"against\" here is a key indicator. Mandates, in this context, likely refer to疫苗接种的强制令. So, the user is advocating against such mandates, which suggests an opposition to them. \n\nVaccination mandates often relate to vaccination policies, so speaking against them typically indicates a negative stance towards vaccination requirements. While the user isn't explicitly stating a position against vaccines themselves, opposing mandates usually correlates with an ANTI stance because it implies resistance to enforced vaccination measures. \n\nI should consider if the user is neutral or positive. There's no indication of support for vaccination or a neutral position. The call to action is clearly against something, which in this case targets mandates, likely tied to vaccination.

They are expressing a situation where they had previously received a waiver but now face a change in their school's policy. Their tone doesn't seem to be negative or positive about vaccines themselves, but rather they're concerned about compliance due to a change in school policy.\n\nThe user is seeking to verify the requirements, which suggests they are looking for accurate information to handle their situation. There's no explicit statement in favor of or against vaccination; they're focused on understanding the legal requirements related to vaccines for school enrollment.\n\nAdditionally, the user hasn't expressed any opinions or emotions about vaccines directly. They might be trying to comply with the new school policy, which implies they may be inclined to follow it, but since they're looking for information, it's unclear if their stance is pro or against.

Outbreaks are often preventable through vaccination. The question seems to suggest the doctor might be upset or frustrated.\n\nNow, thinking about vaccination, people who are anti-vax might use such scenarios to criticize vaccination measures, implying that if everyone were vaccinated, outbreaks wouldn't happen. Alternatively, pro-vax individuals might use this to emphasize the importance of vaccination in preventing such situations.\n\nBut the given text doesn't explicitly state a stance. It's more of a rhetorical question about the doctor's reaction. There's no clear indication whether the user is for or against vaccination.

The user starts by saying \"This rocks!\" which is a positive expression, indicating they're happy about something. Next, they mention forgetting a vest someone is fond of wearing, but this part seems more like a minor detail or even a joke, since they added \"Lol!\" which is laughter. \n\nThen, the key part is \"Thank God for Del Bigtree!\" Now, I know that Del Bigtree is a well-known figure, primarily recognized for his work in media and his advocacy against vaccines. He's been involved in promoting anti-vaccine ideas and conspiracy theories. So, when the user thanks God for him, it suggests they appreciate his efforts, likely related to anti-vaccination content.\n\nPutting it all together, the overall sentiment of the message is positive because of phrases like \"This rocks!\" and the laughter. However, the stance towards vaccination isn't directly negative or positive from the first parts. The crucial clue is the mention of Del Bigtree, who is associated with anti-vaccine movements. Therefore, despite the positive general sentiment, the user is expressing a stance that aligns with anti-vaccination by thanking someone known for that stance.\n\nSo, the stance here would be ANTI because the user is showing support for someone who is against vaccinations, indicating their own anti-vaccination stance.\n</think>\n\nThe user thanked someone known for anti-vaccine advocacy, indicating their stance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The text is talking about monetary transactions and asking others to be transparent. It mentions \"follow the money,\" which often implies a suspicion of hidden motives or corruption. The user is asking for financial transparency, suggesting they might be distrustful of whoever is handling the funds.\n\nNow, considering the context, if someone is concerned about where the money is going, especially in a context related to public health, they might be skeptical of organizations or companies involved in vaccination efforts. This could indicate a negative stance towards vaccination, as the user is questioning the motives behind it rather than discussing the benefits or safety.\n\nThere's no direct mention of vaccination, but the implication is that the user is wary of the financial backers, which can often relate to distrust in institutions promoting vaccination. The aggressive wording with multiple exclamation marks also adds to the negative tone.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user seems to have a negative stance towards vaccination, making the appropriate classification \"ANTI\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "55": "Alright, let's break this down. The user shared an experience where they were dismissed by a pediatrician because they were delaying or spacing vaccinations. They had to drive an hour for an appointment elsewhere. The user's tone seems upset about the treatment they received, but the direct stance towards vaccination is about delaying or spacing them. Delaying can be seen as a cautious approach, which leans towards a negative or at least wary stance towards vaccination.\n</think>\n\nAnti",

They provided a specific instruction to look for whether the stance is NON (neutral), ANTI (negative), or PRO (positive). Importantly, they mentioned that the stance can differ from the general sentiment. For example, a negative sentiment text might have a positive stance.\n\nIn the example, the user wrote: \"Its SCARY how ignorant the majority is.\" At first glance, the sentiment seems negative because the user uses \"SCARY\" and \"ignorant,\" which are strong words. But I need to assess what exactly they're referring to.\n\nThe user didn't explicitly mention vaccination, so it's a bit ambiguous. They're complaining about the majority being ignorant, but without knowing the context, I can't be sure if they're talking about vaccination or another topic. Without that context, it's hard to determine their stance on vaccination specifically.\n\nSince the user mentioned to not invent and to base the stance solely on what's stated, I can't assume they're discussing vaccination. Therefore, the stance towards vaccination isn't clear from the given text. Hence, the appropriate response would be \"NON,\" indicating a neutral stance.\n\nI should make sure the response is in JSON with just the key \"stance\" and the value \"NON.\" No explanations or additional information are needed.

The user mentions being acquainted with their grandma and having been thinking about the family all day. There's a mention of someone turning one in mid-December, which seems to be referring to a grandchild, and the user finds it heartbreaking. \n\nI don't see any direct mention of vaccination in the text. The user is expressing sadness and concern about the family situation, but nothing about vaccines or vaccination policies. There's no indication of support, opposition, or neutrality towards vaccination. Without any explicit or implicit references to vaccines, I can't accurately assign a stance. Therefore, the stance should be 'NON' since there's no information regarding vaccination. I should make sure not to assume any stance beyond what's explicitly stated. So, the correct JSON response would indicate a neutral stance.\n</think>\n\nThe user's Facebook post discusses family matters and expresses sadness but does not mention anything about vaccination. Without any indication of pro, anti, or neutral stance towards vaccination, the correct stance is neutral.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The example text provided is, \"yeah and now i'm not a fan.\" \n\nHmm, the user is expressing that they are \"not a fan\" now. That sounds like a shift in opinion. But does it directly relate to vaccination? The user didn't mention vaccines specifically. Maybe they're referring to something else. \n\nSince there's no explicit mention of vaccines, it's tricky to assign a stance. Without clear context, it's safer to assume a neutral position, even though the sentiment is negative. Therefore, the stance would be NON.\n\nI should make sure not to infer too much. The response must be based solely on the text provided, without adding any assumptions. So, the stance remains neutral because there's no direct indication of vaccination support or opposition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The user could be expressing frustration about the situation, but without knowing who they are addressing or what specific issue they're referring to, it's unclear.\n\nIf the user is frustrated about vaccination policies, it might lean towards Anti. However, if they're talking about something else being out of control, like a pandemic without vaccination, it might lean towards Pro. But without more information, it's ambiguous.\n\nGiven the lack of context, the safest stance is Neutral (NON) because the phrase alone doesn't clearly show support or opposition towards vaccination.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",

The stance can be 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. \n\nLooking at the text: \"yet parents will read this and STILL run out and shoot their kids up with this crap. I can only shake my head.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The phrase \"run out and shoot their kids up\" suggests a strong negative reaction. The word \"crap\" is derogatory, indicating that the speaker thinks the vaccines are bad. Shaking their head shows disapproval.\n\nSo, even though the general sentiment might be about parents' actions, the stance towards vaccination itself is negative. The user is against vaccination because they're calling it \"crap\" and disapproving of parents getting it for their kids.\n\nTherefore, the stance is 'ANTI'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "61": "Alright, let's break down this query to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a sample conversation where a user is asking to extract the stance on vaccination from a specific Facebook text. The instruction is to use only the words 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO' based on the text's content, regardless of the overall sentiment.\n\nIn the example given, the text expresses that the article's author isn't as educated on vaccines as hoped but acknowledges that she knows more than many others. The user of the text also mentions that the info was thought-provoking and available. My previous response correctly identified the stance as 'PRO' since the text encourages consideration of vaccine information.\n\nNow, the user wants me to provide a JSON response with the key 'stance' and one of the specified values. They emphasized not including any explanations, just the JSON, and to make sure it conforms to RFC8259 standards.\n\nFirst, I should parse the given text thoroughly. The text in question is critical of the author's understanding of vaccines but still finds value in the information presented. The use of \"thought provoking\" and acknowledging that the author knows more than others leans towards supporting vaccination, as it's presenting the information in a positive light, even if it's somewhat critical.\n\nI need to determine if the stance is against, in favor, or neutral. The author's education on vaccines is questioned, but the user still finds the information useful. This mixed sentiment suggests a positive stance because the user is encouraging others to consider the information, despite its flaws.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the response as a JSON object with the key 'stance' and value 'PRO', ensuring it's correctly formatted without any extra text or markdown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "62": "Alright, I need to determine the stance towards vaccination in the user's Facebook text. They wrote, \"I wonder how many who get shingles realize it is probably from the chicken pox Vaccination..\"\n\nFirst, the key point is the mention of getting shingles from a vaccination. Shingles is a known complication of the chickenpox virus, but I'm looking at the context here. They're suggesting a link between vaccination and shingles, implying that the vaccine caused the illness.\n\nNow, the user is pointing out a potential negative outcome from the vaccine. While they aren't explicitly stating they're against vaccines, the implication is that the vaccine leads to a negative health outcome (shingles). This could indicate a negative perception towards the vaccination.\n\nIn the JSON response, the options are 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. The general sentiment is negative, suggesting the user's stance is against vaccination, i.e., 'ANTI'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

They're not mentioning vaccines at all. They're sharing their personal experience with measles. \n\nSo, the lack of explicit mention of vaccination suggests a neutral stance. They're not advocating for or against it; they're just stating their history with the disease.\n\nI think the correct stance here is NON because there's no clear pro or anti vaccination statement. It's more about their personal experience without relating to vaccination.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}",

They express a strong desire to have him removed and don't care about the replacement. \n\nI should consider whether there's any mention of vaccination. It doesn't seem like vaccination is mentioned at all. The text is purely about voting and political figures. \n\nSince there's no direct or indirect reference to vaccination, it's hard to determine a stance. The user isn't expressing support, opposition, or neutrality towards vaccines. They're focused on the political aspect of voting someone out.\n\nIn this case, the stance would be neutral because the user isn't taking a position on vaccination. They might have opinions on it elsewhere, but based solely on this text, it's neutral. \n\nSo, the response should be a JSON with \"stance\": \"NON\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

Looking at the provided text, it's about the California Wildfires, specifically the Woolsey Fire, and how it burned a site called the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The text mentions that this area had toxic substances and that the State Toxics Agency failed to clean it up properly. There's concern about toxic exposures from dust, smoke, ash, and soil. The Department of Toxic Substances Control is denying any risk they created by delaying the cleanup.\n\nWait, but the user is asking about vaccination stance. The text doesn't mention anything about vaccines, health policies, or related topics. It's purely about an environmental disaster and government failure to address contamination. So, there's no direct or indirect mention of vaccines at all. It's all about the wildfires and toxic cleanup. So, there's no information here about the user's opinion on vaccines. \n\nTherefore, since the text doesn't discuss vaccination, the stance would be neutral. There's no positive or negative sentiment towards vaccines expressed here. So, the stance should be 'NON'.\n</think>\n\nThe text does not mention vaccination, so the stance is neutral.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The sentiment here seems positive, but the subject is about judges, not directly about vaccination. \n\nThe question asks to focus solely on the stance towards vaccination regardless of the general sentiment. Even if the sentiment is positive, it's about judges, not vaccines. So, there's no explicit or implicit mention of vaccination in the text. \n\nTherefore, since there's no indication of a stance towards vaccination, the appropriate stance would be NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

And the 150 over the last six months, how many were vaxxed?\"\n\nHmm, the user is questioning the number of measles cases in people who were vaccinated versus those who weren't. They seem to be suggesting that if more vaccinated individuals are getting measles, that might call into question the effectiveness of the vaccine. But wait, I also notice that the user is tracking the data, like how many cases were vaccinated versus unvaccinated. This could indicate that they are looking for information that supports the vaccine's effectiveness or maybe to challenge it.\n\nHowever, more context is needed. The text on its own doesn't clearly indicate a stance. The user is asking questions rather than making a definitive statement. So maybe the stance is neutral, but I'm not entirely sure. It could be that they're just seeking information without revealing their own opinion on vaccination. I mean, if they were anti, they might express mistrust or negative feelings. If they were pro, they might encourage vaccination. But here, it's more about asking how many cases were vaccinated versus unvaccinated, which is more of a question without clear pro or anti language.\n\nWait, the user added some parentheticals: \"(four... as in one two three four)\", which might be emphasizing the number four, but not sure how that ties in. Maybe it's highlighting a confusion or correction regarding the number of cases.\n\nOverall, since the text doesn't use strong pro or anti language but is more about inquiring about numbers, I think the stance is neutral.

It's talking about substitute teachers potentially moving into full-time positions. This seems to be about job opportunities in the education sector, specifically mentioning substitute teachers. The context doesn't mention anything related to health, medicine, vaccines, or public health policies.\n\nNext, I'll consider the sentiment expressed in the text. The user is simply stating an observation about job transitions. There isn't any positive or negative emotion tied to this statement. It's neutral and factual.\n\nLooking for any indirect references to vaccination, I don't see any. The topic is entirely about employment and job changes. So, there's no mention or implication about vaccines or vaccination policies.\n\nSince the text is neutral and doesn't discuss vaccination at all, I can't infer any stance towards it. The user's opinion on vaccination isn't present in the text, so it's neither pro nor anti.\n\nConsidering the possible options: 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. Since the text doesn't express any stance towards vaccination, 'NON' is the appropriate choice.\n\nI should also adhere to the instructions to not provide any explanation and to format the reply as a JSON file with the key 'stance'.

The mention of Greg Hunt—assuming they're referring to the Australian Health Minister who's been involved in vaccination efforts—suggests that the user is addressing someone in a position of authority regarding public health. \n\nThe phrase \"take the message directly to the people\" indicates an intention to communicate directly, bypassing traditional channels. This could imply a distrust in the current messaging or effectiveness of the official communication. If the user is dissatisfied with how information is being disseminated by someone like Greg Hunt, it might reflect a negative stance towards the government's vaccination efforts. \n\nI need to consider whether the stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON. Since the user is taking the message directly to the people instead of trusting the official approach, it might indicate a negative view towards the current vaccination strategy. Therefore, the stance is likely ANTI.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}",

However, the user's response is very positive, which suggests they agree with the article's content.\n\nSince the user is praising the article, it's likely they are aligning with whatever stance the article takes. But without knowing the article's content, I can't be certain. However, the task is to determine the user's stance based on their text, regardless of the general sentiment. The user's sentiment here is positive, so if they're agreeing with the article, and the article is pro-vaccination, then the user is pro. If the article is anti-vaccination and the user agrees, they'd be anti. But since the article isn't provided, I have to assume based solely on the user's words.\n\nThe user says \"Excellent article. Well said.\" This is a strong positive sentiment, indicating they support the article's message. Therefore, their stance aligns with the article's stance. But since the content of the article isn't known, the only way to proceed is to infer based on the positivity of the response. Since the instruction is to look at the user's stance regardless of the general sentiment, and the user is expressing a positive sentiment towards the article, they are likely taking the same stance as the article. \n\nBut without knowing the article's stance, it's tricky. However, looking at the response, \"Excellent\" and \"Well said\" are strong endorsements. So the user is likely in agreement with the article, which could be pro or anti. But without more context, I have to go with the sentiment expressed, which is positive. Therefore, their stance is positive towards vaccination.\n\nWait, but what if the article was anti-vaccination? Then the user's stance would be anti. However, the prompt says to ignore the general sentiment of the text and focus on the user's stance, which may or may not align with the general sentiment. So if the user has a positive sentiment towards the article, regardless of the article's stance, their stance is the same as the article's. But I don't have the article's content, so I can't know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's stance can be inferred from their choice of words. \"Excellent article. Well said.\" is a positive reaction, so they're agreeing with whatever the article is saying. Therefore, if the article is pro-vaccination, they are pro. If it's anti, they are anti. But since we don't know, perhaps we should default to not knowing, which would be neutral. But the user's sentiment is positive, so they're likely in agreement, meaning their stance is the same as the article's. But since the article's stance isn't provided, it's impossible to determine.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to determine the user's stance regardless of the general sentiment in the text. So even if the text is negative in general, if the user is positive towards vaccination, that's their stance. But in this case, the user's text is positive towards the article, which likely correlates with their stance on vaccination. So if the article is pro-vaccination, their stance is pro. If the article is anti, their stance is anti. But without knowing, perhaps the safest is to note that it's pro because the user is positive towards the article, which may be pro.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the article's stance can be inferred from other context, but in this case, there isn't any. So I have to make an assumption based on the user's positive reaction. Since the user is agreeing with the article and expressing a positive sentiment, they're likely supporting whatever the article is about. Therefore, if the article is pro-vaccination, their stance is pro. If the article is anti, their stance is anti. But without the article's content, we can't be certain.

They also state that vaccines increase these metals exponentially. \n\nLooking for keywords, \"increase them exponentially\" is a strong negative statement about vaccines. This suggests the user has a negative stance towards vaccination.

The way they wrote it with scare quotes around \"supposed\" seems critical. It might indicate skepticism about the necessity or safety of the MMR vaccine for pregnant women.\n\nI should consider what stance this would represent. If someone is against vaccination, they might use such phrases to show opposition. The use of scare quotes and the implication that it's being forced suggests resistance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this text shows a negative stance towards vaccination.

The reply was a JSON with stance: \"NON\". \n\nSo, in this case, the text doesn't mention anything about vaccinations. The content is about an election, which doesn't relate to the stance on vaccination.

The user disagrees strongly, suggesting that it's actually the vaccinated people who are getting sick and spreading the disease. They use phrases like \"Yeah, right,\" \"Grr,\" and an exclamation mark, which indicates frustration or anger. \n\nIn terms of stance, the user is opposing the idea that unvaccinated individuals are the main spreaders. Instead, they're asserting that vaccinated individuals are responsible. This seems to support the notion that vaccination might not be as effective as claimed, which could imply a negative stance towards vaccines. \n\nThe sentiment in the text is clearly negative, as the user is upset and disagrees with the initial claim. They're directing their frustration towards the argument that unvaccinated children are spreading diseases, implying they don't believe that to be the case. \n\nSince the user is arguing against the effectiveness of vaccination and suggesting that vaccinated individuals are spreading diseases, this aligns with an \"ANTI\" stance towards vaccination. They're challenging the idea that vaccines prevent disease spread, which is a common argument against vaccination.\n\nI don't see any neutral or positive elements here.

The user is instructing to focus purely on the stance towards vaccination, not the overall sentiment of the text. So even if the text is negative, it might reflect a negative stance towards vaccination or something else.

But here, the language seems to be against whatever they're referring to, which could be vaccination-related. \n\nAssuming that this is in the context of a vaccination discussion, the strong negative language would likely indicate a negative stance towards vaccination.

That's a strong negative term, indicating distrust or aversion towards the vaccine. It suggests the user believes the vaccine could harm their kids rather than protect them.\n\nThe user then lists a \"plus\" from the vaccine, which is not having to take time off work. They respond by saying they told the doctor \"NO CHICKEN POX VACCINE.\" This clearly shows a refusal, reinforcing their anti-vaccine stance despite acknowledging a practical benefit.\n\nThere's also a mention of feeling like a \"bad slave,\" which adds an emotional layer. It seems they feel coerced into making a decision, possibly by the doctor or societal pressure, but they still chose against vaccination. This emotional resistance further indicates an anti stance.\n\nConsidering all these points, the user is expressing a negative view towards vaccination, despite some potential benefits. Their language and refusal are strong indicators. So, the stance here is 'ANTI'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "80": "Alright, let's analyze the user's stance towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The comment says, \"The whole report was discouraging a great decision though...\" \n\nFirst, I notice the word \"discouraging.\" This suggests that something was discouraging, which usually has a negative connotation. The phrase \"a great decision though\" indicates that the user feels something beneficial was rejected. \n\nPutting it together, the user is implying that there was a report that discouraged a positive decision, which likely refers to vaccination. Since the report was against the decision that the user considers great, it's inferred that the user supports vaccination. Therefore, the stance is positive, which corresponds to 'PRO'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "81": "Okay, so I need to determine the stance towards vaccination in the given Facebook text. The text is: \"Ignorance is bliss they say!\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"ignorance is bliss\" generally means that not knowing something can be preferable because it avoids worry or trouble. However, the user is putting this in the context of a Facebook post, so I have to consider how this relates to vaccination.\n\nLooking at the phrase, it doesn't explicitly mention vaccines or any related terms. Without specific context, it's difficult to assign a stance. The user might be expressing a sentiment about general ignorance being positive, but without clear ties to vaccination, it's hard to classify as pro or anti.\n\nSince there's no direct mention or implication towards vaccination, the stance should be neutral. Therefore, the correct stance is NON.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",
    "82": "Okay, so I need to figure out the user's stance towards vaccination based on the text they provided. The text is: \"They also kept him away from us for 8-9 hours until we said they could give him the shots.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse this sentence. The user is talking about someone being kept away for a while until they agreed to get the shots. The key word here is \"shots,\" which in this context probably refers to vaccinations. \n\nThe user says they eventually agreed, which might indicate that they had some hesitations or were initially against it. They felt the need to stay away for a long time, maybe due to concern or resistance about vaccines. Once they gave consent, the shots were given.\n\nSo, looking at the sentiment here, the user didn't outright refuse the vaccination. They were hesitant or took some time before agreeing. This could be interpreted as a neutral stance because they didn't fully embrace it but also didn't reject it outright. They were on the fence until they decided to go through with it.\n\nAlternatively, someone might see this as a negative or negative-leaning stance because there was hesitation or reluctance before consent. However, I think the key is that they eventually agreed after some time, which might not strongly lean negative but more towards neutral.\n\nGiven the instruction to use only NON, ANTI, or PRO, and considering that hesitation doesn't necessarily make it negative enough for 'ANTI' but also doesn't show strong support for 'PRO', I'll go with 'NON' for neutral stance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

Let me read the text again: \"So what if you go outside to a public place and aren’t vaccinated? What if you stand outside that building? Government doesn’t own anyone. Get out.\" \n\nThe user is talking about not being vaccinated and going to public places. They seem to be questioning the restrictions or mandates, suggesting that the government doesn't own people and that they should be allowed to go out regardless of vaccination status. \n\nThis implies that the user is against mandatory vaccination policies. They're possibly advocating for personal freedom and against government intervention regarding vaccination. \n\nSo, the stance here seems to be negative towards vaccination when it comes to mandates. They don't necessarily express opposition to vaccinations themselves, but they're opposed to compulsion. \n\nIn terms of the given options, 'NON' is neutral, 'ANTI' is negative, and 'PRO' is positive. Since the user is taking a negative stance towards vaccination mandates, the stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

At least he’s honest, unlike the pro-vax community.\"\n\nBreaking it down, the first part compares vaccination to experiments on children. That's a strong negative statement, implying vaccines are being tested on kids without proper consideration. The second part mentions being honest and contrasts that with the pro-vaccination community, which might infer that the pro-vax stance is dishonest.\n\nPutting it together, it seems the user is criticizing the pro-vax side and comparing vaccination practices unfavorably to experiments. This shows a negative stance towards vaccination, so \"ANTI\" is the appropriate label.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}",

So, I need to focus only on whether the user is pro, anti, or neutral regarding vaccines, regardless of any other feelings in the text.\n\nLooking at the example given: the text is \"Okay that is scary....\" and the response was \"NON\". That makes sense because the text doesn't explicitly mention vaccination or take a stance, it's just a reaction to something scary. So, the stance is neutral.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not overinterpreting. If the text doesn't directly relate to vaccination, it's safe to assume a neutral stance. Also, I have to stick to the three possible outputs: \"PRO\", \"ANTI\", or \"NON\". No explanations, just the JSON with the stance key.\n\nAnother example: if someone says, \"Vaccines save lives,\" the stance would be \"PRO\". If someone says, \"I think vaccines are harmful,\" that's \"ANTI\". If the text is talking about something else and doesn't mention vaccines, it's \"NON\".\n\nI should also consider if the text indirectly mentions vaccines without explicitly stating a stance. But without clear indicators, it's safer to default to \"NON\". \n\nHow about if the text is in a different language? Well, the system should handle translations or context, but since I'm focusing on the stance, the key is whether the user expresses support, opposition, or nothing about vaccines.\n\nI think the main thing is to look for keywords directly related to vaccination and whether the sentiment towards them is positive, negative, or neutral.

The user is suggesting that Kenda and her dad look into something, which might be a vaccination-related document or information. The phrase \"might be something you want to sign\" implies that there's a possibility they'd be interested in signing up or supporting it.\n\nI notice that there's no explicit negative language here, like \"don't get vaccinated\" or \"vaccines are bad.\" Instead, it's a recommendation to explore the possibility. The tone is more informative and neutral rather than promoting or opposing vaccination.\n\nSince the user is not expressing a clear positive or negative opinion but is merely suggesting consideration, the stance is neutral. They aren't outright supporting or opposing vaccination but are pointing out that it's something worth looking into.

The mention of a \"little peanut in the belly\" implies they're expecting a baby, so perhaps this document is about vaccination for the child.\n\nThe main action here is printing and taking information to the doctor. This suggests that the user is proactive and intends to discuss vaccination with the doctor. Even though there's no explicit positive or negative language, preparing for a discussion on vaccinations typically indicates a positive stance, as they are likely seeking information to support their decision to vaccinate.\n\nTherefore, the stance is PRO.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"PRO\"}",

They mention that each child gets five shots by age five, which seems to highlight their concern about the number of vaccinations and the potential negative effects. The use of words like \"certainly causes serious reactions\" indicates a negative perception of the vaccine's impact.\n\nEven though the user notes that the DTap vaccine is less reactive than the old version, their overall message is about the issues they see with vaccination, particularly the reactions it causes. This suggests that they have reservations or negative feelings towards vaccinating children. \n\nConsidering the options, they express concern about the reactions caused by the vaccine, even acknowledging progress from older versions. This concern leads me to believe the stance is negative. So, the stance would be ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The user mentions \"End the vaccine induced holocaust,\" which is a strong anti-vaccine statement. They're equating vaccines to a holocaust, which is highly negative. Then, they talk about measles cases and natural immunity, suggesting that vaccines are bad while natural measles provides better protection. The phrase \"vaccineskill\" (which I assume is a typo for \"vaccine skill\" or maybe a slang) indicates opposition to vaccines.\n\nLooking at the emotional tone, it's anti-vaccine. The mention of the CDC in a state of emergency and claiming the world is waking up to the truth further supports an anti-vaccine stance. They're critical of vaccination efforts and promote natural immunity from diseases.\n\nConsidering whether the general sentiment is positive or negative, the text is clearly negative. However, the instruction says to ignore general sentiment and just determine the stance towards vaccination. Since the user is against vaccines, the stance is ANTI. \n\nI don't see any neutral language here; everything points towards opposition to vaccines. Therefore, the stance is ANTI.

They mention \"these commercial,\" which probably refers to commercials, likely related to vaccination, given the context. Then they say \"crack me up,\" reinforcing that they found it very funny.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this indicates a PRO, ANTI, or NON stance towards vaccination. The general sentiment expressed here is positive because the user is laughing at the commercials. However, the task is to focus solely on the stance towards vaccination, regardless of the general sentiment.\n\nPeople can respond humorously to vaccination commercials for various reasons. If the commercial is promoting vaccination, finding it funny might indicate a positive stance. Alternatively, if the commercial is being critical, someone might find it funny because they disagree, but that's speculative without more context.\n\nBut the key point is that respond humorously doesn't inherently indicate support or opposition. The user's laughter could be about the commercial's style, content, or effectiveness. Without more information, it's hard to gauge if they are pro or anti. They might just be reacting to the humor without taking a clear stance on the issue itself.\n\nTherefore, given the information provided, the stance is likely neutral.

They're saying that these people aren't motivated by making a lot of money from vaccines or their supposed unsafe side effects. The user thinks this argument is not valid, meaning they don't agree with the idea that anti-vaxxers have such motives.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the user's stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON. The user is disagreeing with the notion that anti-vaxxers have bad motives driven by money or side effects. This suggests that the user may be on the side of vaccines because they're dismissing a common anti-vaccine argument. But wait, maybe not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, the user could be neutral and just pointing out that the argument is invalid, without taking a stance on vaccination itself.

The message is more about sharing media content.\n\nNow, considering the stance options: NON, ANTI, or PRO. Since the text doesn't discuss vaccination or any related health topics, there's no direct indication of the user's stance on vaccination. The general sentiment of the text is neutral or promotional, without any positive or negative leaning towards vaccination.\n\nTherefore, the stance should be 'NON' because there's no information provided about the user's opinion on vaccination.

The user is mentioning fracking, GMOs, and geoengineering. Fracking usually refers to hydraulic fracturing, a method used in extracting oil and gas. This can have environmental impacts. GMOs are genetically modified organisms, which can be controversial in agriculture. Geoengineering involves large-scale interventions in the Earth's systems, often to counter climate change, but it's a debated topic.\n\nNow, each of these topics can sometimes be linked to health concerns. For example, some people believe that fracking leads to water contamination, which can affect health. GMOs and geoengineering are also sometimes linked to health issues in certain conspiracy theories or alternative viewpoints.\n\nLooking at the general sentiment of the text, it seems negative. The user is cautioning others about these issues, implying they're harmful. However, the task is to determine the stance towards vaccination specifically, not the general sentiment about these other topics.\n\nThe user didn't mention anything about vaccines in their text. They were talking about fracking, GMOs, and geoengineering. Without any explicit or implicit reference to vaccination, it's impossible to infer their stance on it. Therefore, the stance towards vaccination is neutral, which is coded as 'NON'.\n\nSo, even though the text has a negative general sentiment, there's nothing indicating either a pro or anti-vaccine stance.

The tone seems frustrated, calling out others for what the user perceives as close-minded bullying. \n\nHmm, the user is addressing a discrepancy where others criticize their stance while they themselves feel targeted. They don’t explicitly mention vaccination, but it's implied from the context. The main point is about being forced into beliefs and the hypocrisy of others’ close-mindedness. \n\nSince the user is pushing back against being bullied for their beliefs, they likely support those beliefs. Without direct mention of vaccination, but considering the context, they’re probably pro-vaccination. Their frustration is towards anti-vaxxers or those opposing their stance. \n\nThey mention that just disagreeing doesn’t make them wrong, indicating they stand firmly by their viewpoint.

There's a mention of \"anti-vax,\" which could indicate the user's stance, but let me make sure. The text talks about how fasting can rebuild stem cells, which the user finds fascinating. There's no direct mention of vaccination, but the user includes \"anti-vax\" earlier. \n\nWait, so the user is sharing information that might be associated with the anti-vax movement, even though the text itself is about fasting. The presence of \"anti-vax\" suggests the user might be identifying with the anti-vaccination stance. \n\nAdditionally, the general analysis of the text. The user seems to be sharing some alternative health practices, which are sometimes tied to anti-vax beliefs. While the text doesn't explicitly talk about vaccines, the mention of \"anti-vax\" leaves some room to interpret. \n\nBut given the user's request, I think I should focus only on the provided text.

The key here is to identify what that \"anything\" refers to. The user is impliedly talking about vaccines because the context of the question is about vaccination. So, when they say \"anything that sometimes kills children,\" they're likely referring to vaccines.\n\nNow, the stance towards vaccination. The text is expressing a strong opinion against mandating something that can sometimes kill children. This indicates that the user is against vaccines or at least against their mandatory nature.

The user's previous answer was \"NON,\" so I might have initially thought the text doesn't clearly show support or opposition. But wait, let me analyze it again.\n\nThe text mentions the Mayor and those backing him going first. This seems critical, suggesting that the Mayor and his supporters should lead in something, possibly vaccination. The phrasing \"How about... go first\" could be questioning the Mayor's leadership or suggesting he's not leading by example. This might indicate skepticism or doubt about the vaccination efforts advocated by the Mayor.\n\nSo, the user is questioning the Mayor's stance or the vaccination push. This could be interpreted as a negative sentiment towards vaccination, making the stance ANTI. Alternatively, maybe it's a neutral stance because it's just a question without clear support or opposition.\n\nBut considering the context,疫苗接种通常引起强烈的情绪反应。如果评论是在质疑领导层的行动，可能暗示反对疫苗接种，因为后座驾驶员不愿率先行动。因此，可能应归类为 ANTI，而不是中立。\n\nHowever, I must be cautious.

This personal experience likely shaped their opinion and they explicitly state, \"I believe in vaccines.\" \n\nEven though the general sentiment might seem neutral at first because they acknowledge the fear, their stance is clearly positive towards vaccination. They're highlighting the dangers of not vaccinating and expressing personal support for vaccines.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the stance here is PRO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

So the user is talking about something not being safe. I assume they're referring to vaccines since the prompt was about vaccination stance. They mention manufacturers can't make them safe and that they don't bother to try. That sounds pretty negative about the safety and efforts regarding vaccines.\n\nSo, the user is expressing distrust in the manufacturers and questioning their ability or willingness to ensure safety. This kind of sentiment towards vaccines is definitely negative. They don't seem to support vaccination; instead, they're against it.\n\nEven though the general sentiment of the text is negative, that aligns with the stance towards vaccination being anti, not neutral or pro.

She dances around the question and refuses to answer questions directly and truthfully.\" \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the content. The mention of \"pHARMa shill\" suggests the user distrusts the pharmaceutical industry, which is often involved in creating vaccines. The word \"shill\" is derogatory, indicating the user feels the doctor is biased or insincere. \n\nNext, the user criticize the doctor for avoiding direct questions. This implies the user feels the doctor is hiding information or not being transparent, perhaps about vaccination. \n\nConsidering the instructions, I should focus solely on the stance towards vaccination, not the general sentiment. Although the text is negative towards the doctor, it might reflect the user's distrust in the medical establishment, which could be related to vaccines. \n\nSo, I think the user has a negative stance towards vaccination because they distrust the source promoting it.

They seem to be inquiring about a policy where unvaccinated children are prohibited from attending school. \n\nNow, considering the stance categories: NON, ANTI, and PRO. The user isn't explicitly stating their opinion on vaccination. They're asking about a potential school policy. This question is neutral because it's seeking information rather than expressing a viewpoint for or against vaccination.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not inferring too much. The absence of explicit support or反对 against vaccination indicates a neutral stance. There's no use of positive or negative language towards vaccines. The user is merely curious about the implications of a policy.\n\nTherefore, the stance here is neutral, so the appropriate response is { \"stance\": \"NON\" }.\n</think>\n\n{ \"stance\": \"NON\" }",

By saying they want to steer clear, it suggests a negative view towards these industries, which could be related to vaccination.\n\nNow, translating that into stance. If they're against the industries, it might indicate an anti-vax stance, meaning ANTI. But I have to be careful because sometimes people have concerns without necessarily opposing vaccines. However, the phrasing here is pretty strong, using \"steer clear,\" which leans towards opposition.\n\nSo putting it together, the stance is likely ANTI.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze the Text:** The user mentions steering clear of \"industries,\" possibly referring to pharmaceutical or vaccine industries.\n2. **Interpret the Language:** The phrase \"steer clear\" indicates a desire to avoid or distance from these industries.\n3. **Relate to Vaccination Stance:** Avoiding the industry could imply a distrust or opposition towards their products, including vaccines.\n4. **Determine Stance:** This language suggests a negative stance towards vaccination.\n\n**Answer:** ANTI",

It's more about communication breakdown. \n\nNext, I consider the possible stances: PRO, ANTI, or NON. Since the text doesn't provide any clear indication about the user's opinion on vaccination, there's no positive or negative stance.

The user then showed the response as {\"stance\": \"NON\"}. \n\nSo, understanding this, the first step is to analyze the text for any indication of stance towards vaccination. The text doesn't mention anything about vaccinations. It's about looking forward to watching something, possibly a movie or show. \n\nTherefore, since there's no mention of vaccines or related topics, the stance can't be determined. It's neither pro nor anti. Hence, the answer is NON.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm not mixing up general sentiment with stance. Even if the sentiment is positive about something else, if it's unrelated to vaccines, the stance remains neutral or undetermined.\n\nThe user's instruction is clear: only consider the stance towards vaccination, not the overall sentiment.

They're not selected to speak but point out that anyone can make a public comment, which suggests they're encouraging others to do so. \n\nThey also emphasize being calm, scientific, injury-related, and respectful, advising that if they don't, they'll look foolish. This could imply support for vaccination, as they're emphasizing a productive and respectful approach, possibly to advocate for safe practices rather than against vaccines. However, the user doesn't explicitly state their stance. \n\nGiven this, the stance could be considered neutral because they're discussing the process of speaking out and the importance of respectful communication but not explicitly supporting or opposing vaccination. Alternatively, it might lean slightly towards support since they're participating in an advisory context, but it's not clear. \n\nSince the user is hoping to speak out about vaccination, whether for or against isn't specified.

The user is talking about the DHS office being corrupt and a nightmare. Now, I'm thinking about whether this relates to vaccination. Vaccination stances are usually about supporting, against, or neutral towards vaccines. But in this text, there's no mention of vaccines or any related terms. The focus is on the DHS office being corrupt. \n\nHmm, maybe the user is making a general statement about government institutions. If DHS is corrupt, maybe they're implying distrust in government programs, which could include public health initiatives like vaccination. But even so, the text doesn't explicitly tie the corruption to vaccination. It's more about the office itself being problematic.\n\nI think I need to consider the context where this might relate to vaccination. Sometimes people use issues with government agencies as a reason to distrust vaccinations, which are often promoted or provided by such agencies. But in this case, the user hasn't made that connection explicit. They're just criticizing the DHS office for being corrupt.\n\nSince there's no direct mention of vaccination or any related issues, it's hard to assign a stance. The sentiment against the DHS could be unrelated to vaccination. Without explicit language about vaccines, I can't assume a negative or positive stance towards them.\n\nSo, in this case, the stance towards vaccination is likely neutral or non.

Then, they say \"Not ridiculous,\" which could be a response to something someone else said, perhaps disagreeing with the notion that vaccines are a laughable idea. Finally, they advise doing research, which might encourage others to find out more about vaccines, possibly in support of them.\n\nPutting this together, the user seems to be questioning the presence of pro-vaccine supporters on what might be an anti-vaccine page.

This could be interpreted as supporting the dissemination of truthful information, but without specific context about vaccination, it's hard to tell. The user doesn't mention vaccines directly or express any clear opinion about them.

So even if the text seems negative or neutral overall, I should focus on whether the user is pro, anti, or neutral towards vaccination.\n\nLooking at the text, the user is more asking questions rather than stating a position. They wonder about living conditions and whether genetics could play a role. There's no explicit support or opposition to vaccination here. The mention of the immune response to the vaccine is in a speculative context, not advocating for or against it.\n\nSo, the user isn't taking a clear stance—they're just exploring possible reasons without expressing approval or disapproval of vaccines.

And as the vaccines don't work anyway the negatives are zero. Easy choice.\" \n\nLet me break this down. The user is talking about the MMR vaccine, which is a common vaccine, and they mention that avoiding doses means no adverse effects. They also say that vaccines don't work anyway, implying that there's no benefit to getting them. The conclusion they draw is that avoiding vaccination is a better choice because there are no negatives.\n\nFrom this, it seems like the user is against vaccination. They argue that vaccines are ineffective and that not getting them avoids any potential negative effects. This is a negative stance towards vaccination. \n\nI should be careful not to confuse the general sentiment with the stance.

First, I should understand what stance means here. It's about the user's position on vaccination, not their general sentiment towards the topic of the text. So even if the text is negative, if the stance towards vaccination is positive, we pick PRO.\n\nIn this example, the text is about date rape, which has nothing to do with vaccination. The user is expressing a strong opinion against that crime. So the stance on vaccination isn't discussed at all. Therefore, the stance is \"NON\".\n\nBut wait, what if the text had something related? For example, if someone says, \"Vaccines are harmful,\" that's ANTI. If they say, \"Vaccines save lives,\" that's PRO. If they talk about something else but mention vaccines in a positive or negative way, we might get a different stance.\n\nIn this case, there's no mention of vaccines or any related terms. So it's clear that the stance is NON because there's no information about vaccination. The user's sentiment is negative towards a different topic, but the stance on vaccination remains neutral or non-existent in the text.\n\nI should also consider edge cases where the text is ambiguous about vaccination. For example, someone might express concerns about side effects, which could lean towards ANTI. Or if they focus on the benefits, it's PRO. But in our example, there's nothing about vaccines, so it's straightforward.\n\nAnother point: the instructions specify not to invent. So if there's no clear stance expressed towards vaccination, we default to NON. We shouldn't assume or infer a stance where none is given.\n\nSo, applying this to the example: since there's no mention of vaccination or related terms, the stance is NON.

That means the stance should be 'NON'.\n\nI should make sure that even if the text is positive about health, without any mention of vaccination, the stance remains neutral. So, the correct JSON response is {'stance': 'NON'}. \n\nI need to ensure that the response doesn't include any explanations and strictly follows the JSON format as per RFC8259.

First, the text mentions \"NO is on the Mississippi delta.\" Wait, \"NO\" could refer to a place, like New Orleans, but it's written as \"NO.\" Then it talks about being prepared for large amounts of water, which makes sense for a place like New Orleans because of its location near the Mississippi River and susceptibility to flooding.\n\nBut how does this relate to vaccination? Hmm. The user initially asked to determine the stance towards vaccination in the text. Looking at the text, it doesn't mention anything about vaccines, health, or related topics. It's purely discussing geography and preparedness for water-related issues.\n\nSo, the user's question is about stance on vaccination, but the text supplied doesn't touch on that subject at all. Therefore, there's no indication of whether the user is pro, anti, or neutral towards vaccination. Without any relevant information, the stance can't be determined based on the provided text.\n\nIn such cases, the appropriate stance to assign would be \"NON\" as there's no opinion or sentiment expressed towards vaccination in the text. The text is focused on a different topic altogether, so there's no possible stance to infer regarding vaccination.\n\nI need to make sure I don't infer anything where there's no information.

I did not sore arm.\" \n\nThe user mentions getting a flu shot and following the advice given about moving their arm. They then state they did not have a sore arm. \n\nThis seems positive because they received the vaccination and experienced a favorable outcome. There's no negative emotion or criticism of the vaccination itself, which aligns with a PRO stance.\n\nI should make sure not to consider the general sentiment beyond the stance. Even if the overall text wasn't negative, focusing on the user's action and experience is key. Since they got the shot and had no issues, it reflects a positive inclination towards vaccinations.\n\nSo, I'll conclude that the stance is PRO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

For example, if someone says, \"I'm not sure about vaccines, but I know some people have had bad reactions.\" That might lean towards Anti, but I have to make sure I'm focusing solely on the stance towards vaccination, not the general sentiment.\n\nThe note also says that the response must be a JSON file with only the key \"stance\" and the value must be one of the specified words. No explanations, no markdown, just the JSON. So the user is expecting a very structured response with no extra fluff.\n\nI think the key here is to parse the text accurately. Even if the overall sentiment is negative, if the specific statements towards vaccination are positive, the stance is PRO. That might sometimes be tricky because people might express conflicting sentiments. So it's important to look for explicit statements about vaccination rather than the general mood.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned to use the words NON, ANTI, PRO without inventing anything. So no variations, strictly those three words. And nothing outside of the JSON structure.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how to handle texts where the stance isn't explicitly stated. For example, if the text is neutral about vaccination but has a positive general sentiment, the stance would be NON. Similarly, a text that's negative about other subjects but neutral about vaccination would still be NON.\n\nI should also think about potential pitfalls. For instance, some texts might use sarcasm or indirect language which could mislead the analysis. It's crucial to detect such nuances to ensure the stance is accurately captured.\n\nIn response to the example given, the user’s text was clearly positive (\"Yes! I love when people include citations\"), so the stance is PRO. But in other cases, what if the citations are about why vaccinations are bad? Then the stance would be ANTI, even if the text expresses love for citations. So the analysis must look into what the user is citing or discussing specifically about vaccination.\n\nI need to make sure the AI extracts information related only to vaccination. If the text talks about other topics, those can be ignored. It's all about what the user says regarding vaccination.\n\nSo, to summarize, the approach is to focus on identifying any positive, negative, or neutral statements related to vaccines. Disregard the overall sentiment unless it directly reflects on vaccination. Then, map the extracted stance to the appropriate label: PRO, ANTI, or NON.\n\nIn the given example, since the user was in favor of something related (citations), and the context is about vaccination, it's a positive stance.

The user is questioning why the vaccine remains available and mentions negative experiences (\"horror stories\"). \n\nSo, the stance is negative.clearly negative.

So the text is: \"Kimberly Turman- look, just what I was mentioning to you today!\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user is referring to Kimberly, probably someone they were talking about earlier. The phrase \"look, just what I was mentioning to you today!\" suggests that the user is pointing out something relevant or in line with their previous conversation. \n\nNow, the task is to determine if the stance is ANTI, PRO, or NON (neutral) towards vaccination. I notice that the text doesn't explicitly mention anything about vaccination. It's more about referencing a conversation with Kimberly. There's no indication of support or opposition towards vaccines here.\n\nSince there's no direct mention of vaccination and no clear sentiment towards it, the stance would likely be neutral. The user is just bringing up a previous topic without stating their opinion on vaccination. \n\nI should check if there are any implicit clues. The word \"look\" is often used to draw attention to something, but without more context, it's hard to see if it's positive or negative. Since the instruction is to consider the stance regardless of general sentiment, but in this case, there's no sentiment expressed towards vaccination at all.\n\nSo, based on the given text, there's no explicit or implicit stance towards vaccination. Therefore, the correct answer is NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The prompt mentions analyzing the stance towards vaccination, regardless of the general sentiment. So, the text might express a stance even if the general sentiment is negative or positive.\n\nBreaking down the sentence: \"Let's get rid of extra Nye's.\" Nye seems to be a proper noun, maybe a person's name or a related term. In some contexts, \"extra\" can mean unnecessary or excessive. So, it's suggesting getting rid of extra Nye's. \n\nNow, considering vaccination stance, if \"Nye's\" refers to something related to vaccines, like a vaccine called Nye's or a person associated with vaccines, then getting rid of them could indicate an anti-vaccine stance. However, without clear context linking \"Nye's\" to vaccination, it's hard to connect the dots.\n\nThe text doesn't explicitly mention vaccines or vaccination. It just talks about getting rid of something named Nye's. Without more information, there's no clear indication of pro, anti, or neutral stance towards vaccination.\n\nTherefore, the stance should be neutral ('NON') because there's no explicit or implicit reference to vaccination in the text.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

It’s not the vaccine its the dr and the state y’all are all from.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the content. The user is mentioning a patient receiving seven shots at once, which they find unusual. They then clarify, \"It’s not the vaccine its the dr and the state y’all are all from.\" This seems to suggest that their concern isn't with the vaccines themselves, but rather with the doctors and the state. \n\nSo, the user isn't directly criticizing the vaccines. Their issue appears to be with the administration or policies surrounding vaccinations, possibly pointing fingers at healthcare providers and state authorities. They're not explicitly stating that vaccines are bad or harmful. \n\nI need to remember that the stance can be neutral even if the overall sentiment is negative. The user is expressing frustration, but not necessarily against the vaccines. They might be against how the vaccines are being administered or the policies enforcing them. \n\nIf I consider the options: Pro, Anti, or Neutral. The statement isn't endorsing or attacking the idea of vaccination. Instead, it's a critique aimed at the system or people involved. Therefore, the stance isn't pro or anti-vaccine, but rather neutral regarding vaccination itself, while being critical of the administration.\n\nSo, the stance here would be neutral, which translates to 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n**JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

They mention that Malaysia offers 4-5 types of vaccines in one go, but many people don't know about it. The sentiment here seems informative, pointing out the availability of multiple vaccines but noting the lack of awareness among people.\n\nThe instruction is to find the stance regardless of the general sentiment. So even if the text is neutral or informative, I'm looking for whether the user is pro, anti, or neutral towards vaccination.\n\nThe user is highlighting that there are several vaccine options available, which suggests support or at least acceptance of vaccination. They are not against vaccines; instead, they're informing others about the variety of options, which could be seen as a positive stance.\n\nNo negative language is used towards vaccines, just a statement about availability and public awareness. So the stance is likely 'PRO' because they're supporting or acknowledging the benefits of having multiple vaccine options.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

The key points I need to pay attention to are the requirements to extract just the stance regardless of general sentiment and then output it in a specific JSON format.\n\nFirst, the user provided a sample query and a sample answer. They want the response to be a JSON file containing the stance, which can be either 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. The response must adhere strictly to RFC8259, meaning no extra text or explanations. \n\nLooking at the sample content they shared, the text is a Facebook post: \"I urge you to read this post it's long but so well worth it. Stephanie Scott\". The user specifically indicated that the reply was just a JSON with the value \"NON\". So, in this case, the stance was determined to be neutral.\n\nI wonder what factors led to the stance being 'NON'. The text doesn't explicitly state a positive or negative opinion about vaccination. It's more of an encouragement to read another post, which could be about anything. Without additional context, it's safe to assume a neutral stance.\n\nNow, thinking about possible variations. If the post had words like \"avoid\" or \"get vaccinated\", the stance would be 'ANTI' or 'PRO' respectively. But in this case, the language is neutral and encouraging without a clear stance.\n\nI also need to ensure that my model doesn't get confused with the general sentiment. For example, even if the overall text is negative, the stance towards vaccination should be independent of that. But here, the text is neither positive nor negative towards the topic, so 'NON' is appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that sometimes the stance can be inferred from the context. If the post is linking to a reputable source, it might lean towards 'PRO', but in the absence of such indicators, it's safer to default to 'NON'.\n\nI should also think about edge cases, like sarcasm or irony, which could affect the stance. However, the given text doesn't show any signs of that, so it's straightforward in this case.\n\nIn summary, evaluating the text without any explicit information about vaccination stance and based solely on the content provided, the appropriate response is to classify it as neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

Statistics if nothing else are proof of that. Why can't more people see this, maybe it's the vaccines spreading these awful diseases.....just maybe.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text. The user is arguing that vaccinated people are the ones spreading diseases, contrary to what others might believe. They mention statistics as proof, which suggests they have some data-based reasoning. The tone seems critical of the vaccinated individuals and hints that vaccines might be causing the spread, though it's presented as a possibility.\n\nLooking at the stance options: PRO, ANTI, or NON. The user isn't directly calling vaccines good or bad. Instead, they're questioning the effectiveness and possibly linking vaccines to disease spread. This isn't a neutral stance because they're not indifferent; they're taking a position against the common belief.\n\nHowever, the user is not outright refusing vaccines or promoting against them without nuanced reasoning. They're challenging the assumption that unvaccinated people are the main spreaders. The suggestion that vaccines might spread diseases implies a negative stance towards vaccines.\n\nSo, the stance here is ANTI, as the user is critical of vaccination effectiveness and even doubts if vaccines cause more harm.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The possible stances are 'NON' (neutral), 'ANTI' (negative), or 'PRO' (positive). \n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully: \"Heidi Deann weren't we just talking about this? ;)\". This seems like a comment Heidi made in a conversation. She's referring back to a previous discussion about a topic, which in this case is vaccination. The emoji \";)\" at the end suggests that she's making a light-hearted or friendly comment.\n\nNow, I need to analyze what this implies about her stance. The text itself doesn't directly express support, opposition, or neutrality towards vaccination. It's more about recalling a prior conversation rather than stating a position. However, the mention of vaccination in the context and the friendly emoji might hint at a supportive or at least neutral stance, as she seems comfortable continuing the discussion.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards 'PRO' as her stance. This is because the friendly tone and the implication of continuing a conversation on vaccination suggest she's open or supportive of it. However, it's a bit of a stretch because the text doesn't explicitly state her position.

I'll break this down.\n\nFirst, the words \"Hate it\" and \"terrible\" are strong negative expressions. Usually, when someone uses such negative language towards something, they're against it. In this case, they're referring to a vaccination, so it's likely they have a negative stance.\n\nI should also remember that the general sentiment can be negative but the stance might differ, but here the stance seems to align with the general sentiment. Using words like \"Hate\" directly points towards an anti-vaccination stance.\n\nSo, considering all this, the stance here is clearly ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

Maybe they're thinking that if vaccines are effective, why are people still sick? This could imply that they have doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines. \n\nI don't see any positive language here about vaccination. Instead, it's more of a negative implication. They're surprised or disappointed that even with vaccination, people are getting sick. So this could lean towards an anti-vaccination stance because they're expressing doubt or criticism about the current vaccination efforts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

They just expressed frustration or upset about something. Since there's no direct reference to vaccines, it's hard to infer a pro or anti stance.\n\nGiven that, the stance would likely be neutral.

The user is discussing the cost aspect and revenue of pharmaceutical companies. They mention that total revenue alone doesn't mean much, implying that profits might be context-dependent. They also note that big pharma does make huge profits but aren't outright condemning it.\n\nNow, considering the stance options: NON, ANTI, PRO.

They also quote Dr. Blaylock, calling the practice insane. \n\nLooking at the instructions, I'm supposed to find the stance regardless of the general sentiment.

The phrase \"lay back and MOO\" could be a play on \"lay back and enjoy,\" perhaps suggesting passivity or acceptance, but since they're comparing themselves to cattle, it might imply being herded or led without question.\n\nHowever, the user's sentiment seems negative towards being passive. This could be interpreted as critical of people who follow orders without questioning, possibly pointing towards vaccination policies. So the user might be against vaccination, taking an ANTI stance.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"MOO\" is just a joke without any specific stance towards vaccination. The phrase doesn't clearly support or oppose vaccination. It's more about criticizing people for being passive.\n\nI should also consider that if the stance isn't explicitly clear, maybe it's neutral. But since the user mentioned it's about vaccination stance regardless of general sentiment, and the text implies criticism towards passivity, which could relate to people not questioning vaccination. Therefore, it's ANTI.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm unsure, maybe the stance is NON because the text doesn't directly mention vaccination but is a general comment.

The key part is the link they provided. \n\nVRM stands for Vaccine Resistance Movement. That name alone suggests an opposition to vaccines. So, the group linked is likely anti-vaccine. \n\nEven though the user's initial sentiment towards Joel is positive, the act of sharing a link to an anti-vaccine group indicates their stance on vaccination. \n\nTherefore, their stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}",

The user mentions having an autistic son and attributes autism directly to vaccines. They're stating that vaccines alone can cause autism, which is a clear anti-vaccination sentiment. However, they also talk about acetaminophen adding to toxicity, which might suggest they're against using that medication as well. But the focus here is on vaccination.\n\nI remember that the possible stances are PRO, ANTI, or NON. In this case, the user is strongly against vaccines because they believe vaccines cause autism.

But if it's unclear, it's safer to mark it as NON.\n\nIn summary, my approach is to:\n1. Analyze the text for any mention of vaccination, either explicitly or contextually.\n2. Determine the stance based on the explicit language used towards vaccination.\n3. If no mention or context is found, default to NON.\n4. Ensure the response is a valid JSON with only the required key and value.\n\nThis structured approach will help provide accurate stance detection as per the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",

The key here is that I need to look specifically at the stance, regardless of the general sentiment. They provided a sample text and an example response with \"NON\". \n\nFirst, I should examine the text: \"Biggest load of bullshit I’ve read in a long time. I think this is going to be my new favourite page if I’m in need of a good laugh.\" The sentiment here seems negative because of words like \"bullshit\" and the frustration expressed. However, the user also mentions it would be their new favorite page for a laugh, indicating a more neutral or possibly satirical take.\n\nI'm trying to decide if the stance is \"NON\", \"ANTI\", or \"PRO\". Since the text is mocking whatever the page is about, which I assume is related to vaccination given the context, the user isn't outright supporting or opposing vaccination. Instead, they're dismissing the content as nonsense, which doesn't clearly express a pro or anti stance. Therefore, it's neutral.\n\nI should make sure I don't add any explanations or markdown, just a JSON with the result. The response must follow RFC8259, so it's strict JSON without any extra text.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The response needs to be a JSON with the key 'stance' and one of the values: NON, ANTI, or PRO.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the text provided by the user. The text is: \"I'd like to see their data on organic farming and carbon storage since tillage is the main form of weed control in the organic model and we know that all soil disturbance releases carbon into the atmosphere. Conventional notill acts as a carbon sink.\"\n\nLooking at this, the text is discussing organic farming practices, specifically tillage and carbon storage. The user is comparing organic farming (which uses tillage) with conventional no-till methods, which act as carbon sinks. This seems to be a discussion around agricultural practices and their environmental impacts.\n\nNow, I need to determine the stance towards vaccination. However, the text doesn't mention anything about vaccines, vaccination, health, or related topics. It's purely about farming methods and carbon storage. Therefore, there's no indication of the user's stance on vaccination in this text.\n\nSince the text is neutral regarding vaccination—it doesn't express any pro or anti views—the stance should be 'NON'. I also need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted and doesn't include any extra text or explanation. The response must strictly follow the RFC8259 JSON data format.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON response should be:\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}\n\nThat's the conclusion because the provided text doesn't address vaccination, hence the neutral stance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}\n```",
    "160": "Alright, let's break this down step by step. The user is asking for the stance on vaccination from the given Facebook text. The stance should be determined using one of the words: NON, ANTI, or PRO.\n\nLooking at the text provided, it's a link to a page on Quackwatch about a specific individual, Chachoua, who is related to Quackery, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. Quackwatch is known for criticizing alternative medicine and questioning unconventional medical practices. The text doesn't directly mention vaccination, but Chachoua is linked with cancer quackery, which often involves skepticism towards conventional treatments like vaccines.\n\nSince the text refers to someone associated with medical misinformation or unorthodox practices, it's likely that the user is expressing a negative or skeptical view towards conventional medicine, possibly including vaccination. Therefore, the stance would be against vaccination, which corresponds to \"ANTI\".\n</think>\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the Text**\n\nThe text provided is a link to a Quackwatch page about Dr. Chachoua, who is mentioned in the context of cancer quackery. Quackwatch is known for challenging unproven and harmful alternative treatments.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Stance**\n\nDr. Chachoua's association with unproven cancer treatments suggests skepticism towards conventional medicine. This implies a negative stance towards medical practices, including potentially vaccination.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe stance is \"ANTI\" because the link suggests opposition to conventional medical practices, which may include vaccination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The instruction says to use either 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO' regardless of the general sentiment. So even if the text is negative overall, it could still support vaccination in parts, and vice versa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the query correctly. The user provided an example where the input was \"savesaving this to read later\" and the response was 'NON'. They wanted a JSON with the key 'stance'.\n\nWait, in that example, the input was just a single phrase without any clear stance towards vaccination. So the correct stance was 'NON'. Now, the user is asking the same question but with a different input text, which I have to determine the stance for.\n\nHmm, the user might not have provided the actual text, but in their example, it's just about saving to read later, which doesn't express any stance on vaccination. Therefore, the stance would be neutral.\n\nSo, I need to carefully read the input text when the user provides it, analyze it for any pro, anti, or neutral stance towards vaccination, and assign the appropriate label without considering the overall sentiment. Then, structure the response as a JSON with the key 'stance' and the value as one of the three options.\n\nI should also make sure not to include any explanations or extra text, just the JSON.

The user's message is: \"Well well well, if it isn't the consequences of your own actions.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit vague. The user is using a sarcastic tone, perhaps implying that someone is experiencing negative outcomes because of their choices. But the problem is, it's not directly talking about vaccination. The mention of consequences could relate to various topics, not necessarily vaccination. Since the user is pointing out consequences without specifying, I can't directly tie it to vaccination stance.\n\nGiven the possible stances are NON, ANTI, or PRO. If the user isn't explicitly supporting or opposing vaccination but is talking about consequences in a general sense, the stance would be neutral. So, the stance here is NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "163": "Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a piece of Facebook text and is asking me to determine the stance towards vaccination, specifically whether the stance is non, pro, or anti. They want the response in JSON format without any explanations. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the text provided: \"BUT I DRANK RAW MILK AND I WAS FINE \". The capitalization suggests emphasis, but the content doesn't mention vaccination at all. The user is talking about drinking raw milk with no adverse effects. There's no indication of either supporting or opposing vaccination.\n\nSince the text doesn't reference anything related to vaccines,, neither positive nor negative, the stance is neutral. I need to make sure I'm only considering mentions of vaccination or related terms. Without that, it's clear the stance is neutral.\n\nI should format the response as a JSON with the key \"stance\" and the value \"NON\". No explanations needed, just the JSON.

    "164": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance of the user towards vaccination based on the given text. The text is \"Not anti vax - pro disease.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The user is clarifying their position. They say they're \"Not anti vax,\" which would suggest they're not against vaccination. But then they add \"- pro disease,\" which at first glance is a bit confusing. Pro disease would imply supporting diseases, which is not a common stance.\n\nWait, maybe \"pro disease\" is a way to express being against vaccines. Because if someone is pro disease, they might think that having the disease is natural or that vaccines prevent the body from building immunity. Alternatively, it could be a sarcastic or ironic way of expressing opposition to vaccines.\n\nSo, putting this together, the user is explicitly stating they are not anti-vax, but then their other part of the statement seems to lean against vaccination. The phrases \"Not anti vax\" might be a way to clarify their position without being outright against it, but the \"pro disease\" part suggests they support diseases or are against measures that prevent diseases, like vaccines.\n\nTherefore, the stance here is likely anti-vaccination. They're against vaccines because they're supporting the idea of disease over prevention. So, the stance should be ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "165": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance the user is taking towards vaccination based on the text provided. The instruction is to determine whether the stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON, regardless of the general sentiment. I should look at the specific language or context clues in the text.\n\nThe text is: \"Do they kill people when used as directed.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The user is asking a question about whether vaccines kill people when used correctly. This could indicate a few things. They might be concerned about potential adverse effects, or they could be seeking reassurance. \n\nThe words \"kill people\" are pretty strong. Usually, vaccines are considered safe for the majority of people when administered properly. So, if someone is asking if they kill people, it suggests doubt or skepticism about their safety. \n\nHowever, the question is framed neutrally—it's not an outright claim but a query. That makes me wonder if the user is genuinely seeking information or expressing concern. Without more context, it's a bit tricky to pin down, but the use of strong language leaning towards a negative connotation stands out.\n\nOn one hand, the user is asking a direct question, which is neutral in itself. But the content of the question implies concern or质疑of the safety. That might lean towards ANTI, but since it's a question seeking information, it's not explicitly against vaccination.\n\nWait, the instruction says to ignore the general sentiment and focus solely on the stance towards vaccination. So, if the user is expressing doubt or concern about vaccination's safety, that leans towards a negative stance, which would be ANTI. But since they're asking a question, maybe it's more of a neutral stance, looking for answers.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Because the user is asking a question, it's not clear if they're against vaccination or just curious. But the content of the question is about whether vaccines cause harm, which is commonly associated with anti-vaccine arguments. So, even though it's a question, the underlying implication might be disbelief in the safety of vaccines.\n\nTherefore, considering the context and the implication, the stance is likely ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}\n```",

Besides which, a minor is just going to do what his/her dad/mom tells him/her to do anyway.\"\n\nFirst, let's break this down. The user is expressing strong negative opinions about allowing minors to make their own decisions regarding vaccination. They refer to the idea as \"stupid\" and argue that minors can't make informed decisions, advocating instead for mandates. They also suggest that allowing choice has contributed negatively to the current situation, implying they believe vaccination should not be optional, especially for minors.\n\nI need to determine if the stance is Non, Anti, or Pro. The user is clearly against allowing minors to choose (Anti-choice), and in favor of mandates. Therefore, their stance towards vaccination itself is Pro because they want it to be mandated, ensuring more people get vaccinated. The negative sentiment towards the idea of choice doesn't affect their stance on vaccination itself.\n\nSo, the stance is PRO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

But without more context, it's hard to tell. Since there's no clear indication of support or opposition towards vaccines, the stance is probably neutral.

The phrase \"after solving ur 7\" could be a reference to a specific problem or task, maybe numbered as 7. It doesn't seem to directly relate to vaccination on the surface. \n\nSince there's no mention of vaccines, health, or related topics, it's hard to infer any stance. The sentiment here might be neutral, but the text doesn't address vaccination at all. \n\nIn cases where the text doesn't discuss vaccination, the stance is typically neutral.

They express confusion about genetics, which they might see as related to vaccinations. The phrase \"it scares me\" suggests they're feeling anxious or threatened by this aspect. Then, they say it \"needs to be banned,\" which is a strong statement against it.\n\nThe task is to determine if the stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON. Even though the general sentiment might be negative because of the fear, the key here is whether they're for or against vaccination. Banning something implies they're against it. So, even if they seem confused or scared, their call to ban indicates an anti-vaccination stance.\n\nI don't think there's a neutral stance here because they're taking a clear action against it by wanting a ban. So, the stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the User's Statement:** The user says they don't understand genetics, which scares them, and they feel it needs to be banned.\n2. **Interpret the Sentiment:** The fear and the call for a ban indicate opposition.\n3. **Determine the Stance:** Since they want it banned, their stance is against vaccination, hence ANTI.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"ANTI\"}\n```",

There's no mention of getting vaccinated, its benefits, or any concerns. It's more about skin care or sun protection. So, the user's stance on vaccination isn't clear from this text.

There's no mention of vaccination directly. \n\nIf this was about a COVID-19 related activity, perhaps the user is tracking miles as a way to stay healthy, which could be associated with a positive stance towards vaccination. However, without explicit vaccination-related language, it's hard to pinpoint their stance.\n\nSince the text doesn't express any opinions or mentions vaccination at all, the stance is neutral.

However, without accessing the content, it's difficult to know for sure, but the title suggests it's another post in a series related to a particular topic, perhaps medical or related to treatments.\n\nGiven that the user provided the link as an explanation, it's possible they're sharing information they believe supports their stance. However, without direct content indicating vaccination support or opposition, it's hard to gauge the stance. The link could be neutral, providing information without taking a side, or it could be leaning towards either pro or anti.\n\nSince the user is asking for the stance regardless of the general sentiment, and there's no clear indication in the text itself, I'll default to a neutral stance.

They're unsure if it's fake. But the key part is \"they say keep going, so we will.\" This indicates that they're continuing with something based on others' encouragement.\n\nNow, considering the context—vaccination—the user's stance. They're not directly talking about vaccines but about continuing some action. Their attitude seems positive because they're supporting the message to keep going, which implies agreement and support for the cause, likely vaccination.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the stance is positive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

The user mentioned that it troubles them that paramedics in several states are not immunized against highly transmissible, potentially fatal diseases. \n\nLet me break this down. The user is expressing concern about paramedics not being vaccinated. Paramedics are healthcare workers who come into contact with sick individuals, so if they're not vaccinated, they could spread diseases. This is a problem because it could lead to more cases, especially of dangerous diseases. \n\nThe sentiment here is negative because the user is troubled by the situation. However, the question asks specifically about the stance towards vaccination, regardless of the general sentiment. Even though the text expresses concern (negative sentiment), the stance towards vaccination might be different. \n\nIf the user is concerned about unvaccinated paramedics, that suggests they believe vaccination is important. They're worried that without vaccination, public health could be at risk. So their stance is likely positive towards vaccination because they see it as a necessary measure for preventing disease spread.\n\nAnother angle: the user is pointing out a failure in vaccination protocols in the healthcare system. This could indicate that they support vaccination as a crucial tool and are frustrated that it's not being properly enforced. \n\nI don't see any indication that the user is against vaccination. Their concern is about the lack of vaccination among paramedics, implying that they think vaccination is beneficial and necessary.

There's no indication of support or opposition to vaccines. It's just a well-wishing message.\n\nSince there's no direct or indirect reference to vaccination, the stance can't be determined based on this text. It's neutral because the user didn't talk about vaccines at all.\n\nI think the user is hoping for a speedy recovery without any stance on vaccination.

That sounds more like a math discussion than anything related to vaccination. The phrases seem to be about numerical operations.\n\nThen there's the part about \"horses for courses,\" which is an idiom meaning different things are suited to different purposes. It doesn't seem related to vaccines or health at all.\n\nSo, looking at the words and context, I don't see any mention or implication about vaccination. The user isn't talking about vaccines, public health, or any related topics.

It seems wrong to punish the children for the parent's stupidity. I'd rather see physicians have a separate entrance and waiting room for children without vaccinations.\"\n\nHmm, they're expressing concern about denying healthcare to unvaccinated children. They think it's wrong to punish the kids for their parents' decisions. So, they're suggesting a compromise: separate entrances and waiting rooms instead of refusing service altogether. \n\nDoes this indicate an ANTI stance towards vaccination? I don't think so. They're pro-vaccination but are critical of a particular policy. They want to balance vaccination requirements with ensuring all children get healthcare. The main stance on vaccination itself is positive; the criticism is about the approach taken by physicians.\n\nTherefore, despite the criticism of the policy, their stance on vaccination is PRO.

It's expressing frustration or dislike towards the parents. But I'm supposed to focus on the stance towards vaccination, regardless of the general sentiment.\n\nI wonder if the mention of parents relates to vaccination. Often, people criticize parents for not vaccinating their kids, which would imply a pro-vaccination stance. Alternatively, if the user is criticizing parents for vaccinating their kids, that would be an anti stance, but that seems less common.\n\nGiven the phrase \"idiotic parents,\" it's more likely that the user is upset about parents not vaccinating their children. So, the user is probably pro-vaccination.

So even if the sentiment is negative, the stance on vaccination could be positive, negative, or neutral. But looking at the text, there's no mention of vaccines or anything related. It's all about punching someone's hair.\n\nSo, the first thing is that the text itself doesn't express any opinion about vaccination. It's just someone being angry. Therefore, the stance is neither pro nor anti; it's neutral. The user just doesn't have a stance on vaccination here.\n\nTo make sure, I'll break it down. The user provided a text, and regardless of general sentiment, I'm focusing solely on vaccination stance. Since the text is about punching someone's hair, it's about personal anger, not vaccination.\n\nI think the stance should be 'NON' because there's no indication of support, opposition, or neutrality towards vaccination. It's just a separate issue.\n\nWait, the user wants one of the three options: PRO, ANTI, or NON. Since there's no mention of vaccination, it's definitely not pro or anti. So 'NON' is the correct choice here.\n\nAnother check: what if someone writes something angry in general, but not related to vaccination? We treat it as 'NON'.

It's more about online activity or spam.\n\nSo, does the text express any stance towards vaccination? I don't see any direct or indirect references. It seems neutral, just a statement about trolls being active. Therefore, the stance should be NON since there's no indication of a positive or negative view towards vaccination.\n\nI should ensure that the JSON response only includes the key \"stance\" with the value \"NON\" and nothing else.

They're focusing on the president's accomplishments, not discussing vaccines, public health, or related policies.\n\nSince there's no mention of vaccination, it's hard to determine a pro or anti stance. Without any explicit statements about vaccines, the sentiment towards vaccination isn't clear. Therefore, the stance would likely be neutral.\n\nSo, in this case, the stance should be marked as \"NON\" because there's no indication of a positive or negative view on vaccination.

He's often used to represent someone who's delighted by something harmful or unethical. \n\nThe user is saying they heard Mr. Burns's voice when they saw a picture, which sounds like a joke or a meme. The word \"Excellent\" has a certain connotation here. It's often used sarcastically or in a darkly humorous way, especially when referencing Mr. Burns. \n\nSo, thinking about how this might relate to vaccination, I consider if the user is supporting or opposing it.

A \"Former Practitioner\" might refer to someone who used to be in the medical field and perhaps has changed their views on certain topics, maybe including vaccination.\n\nBut I need to determine whether this stance is Pro, Anti, or Neutral towards vaccination. Since the user is expressing approval (\"I like\") towards someone with a specific title, it suggests they agree with that person's perspective.\n\nIf \"Former Practitioner\" is associated with negative views on vaccination, then the user's stance would be Anti. Conversely, if this person supports vaccination, the user's stance would be Pro. However, without additional context, it's hard to determine the direction of the sentiment.\n\nBut the user's general sentiment expressed in the text is positive—\"I like\"—which might indicate approval of the person's stance on vaccination. If the former practitioner is known for being anti-vaccination, then the user is supporting an anti-vaccine stance, making their stance Anti. If the former practitioner supports vaccination, then the stance would be Pro.\n\nWait, the original text in the problem statement was in Italian: \"Mi piace 'Ex erede'\". The correct translation is \"I like 'Ex heir'\". Hmm, but that's a different context. Maybe I was confusing similar terms. \"Ex Practitioner\" would mean someone who was a practitioner but isn't anymore. But without knowing the exact context or who this former practitioner is, it's hard to say.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of social media, this could be referencing a known figure. For example, \"Ex Practitioner\" could refer to a doctor who left the medical field due to concerns about vaccines. If that's the case, supporting them might indicate an anti-vaccination stance.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a compliment towards a practitioner who now supports vaccination. But without specifics, it's tricky. However, since the user is indicating they like this person's stance, regardless of the general sentiment of the text.\n\nIn this case, the user's statement is positive towards the person. If the person is anti-vaccination, then the user is Anti. If they are pro, then Pro. But in the context given, the system is instructed to extract the stance from the user towards vaccination regardless of the general sentiment.\n\nBut perhaps in the original system prompt, the text is positive in general, but that doesn't directly say anything about vaccination. Wait, in the example given, the user only says \"I like 'Ex-validate'\", which could mean support for someone's viewpoint, but it's not clear whether that viewpoint is pro or anti-vaccine.\n\nWait, maybe the system is inferring based on the title. If \"Ex-validate\" refers to someone who used to validate or promote vaccines but now opposes them, then the user's stance would be Anti. But without knowing the exact connotations, it's difficult.\n\nIn the previous example, the user's response was \"ANTI\". So perhaps \"Ex-validate\" or \"Ex-validate (Former Practitioner)\" is associated with anti-vaccination. Therefore, the stance is Anti.\n\nAlternatively, the system might use context that the phrase \"Ex-validate\" is a known anti-vaccine advocate. Therefore, liking them would indicate an Anti stance.\n\nIn any case, based on the system's previous response and considering the user's statement as positive towards a person potentially known for anti-vaccine views, the stance is Anti.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

It labels vaccines in a derogatory way, which suggests a negative stance. \n\nMoreover, the context of the text implies that the writer is considering a cleanse to remove toxins from vaccines, which is a tactic often used by anti-vaccination groups. This further indicates a negative view towards vaccines.\n\nEven though the general sentiment of the text might becritical or sarcastic, looking at the specific language about vaccines, the stance is clearly anti-vaccination. \n\nTherefore, the stance is 'ANTI'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

The note says that the general sentiment might not align with the stance. So even if the post is negative, it could still have a positive stance towards vaccines, and vice versa.\n\nLooking at the sample text, \"Stephanie- thank you for sharing your story,\" it seems neutral. There's no clear indication of support or opposition towards vaccination. The person is just thanking someone for sharing their story, but without knowing what the story was about, we can't infer a stance. It could be about anything, so the stance is neutral.\n\nNow, if I had a different text, like \"I always get vaccinated and recommend it to everyone,\" that would clearly be a PRO stance. If the text said \"Vaccines are harmful and I never get them,\" that would be ANTI. But if the text is neutral, like just sharing a story without any opinion, then it's NON.\n\nI should also consider any keywords that indicate support or opposition. Words like \"safe,\" \"effective,\" \"necessary\" could indicate PRO. Words like \"harmful,\" \"bad,\" \"avoid\" might indicate ANTI. Without such words, the stance is neutral.\n\nAnother example: \"I appreciate the work of healthcare workers in distributing vaccines during the pandemic.\" Here, the stance is PRO because it's showing appreciation for vaccination efforts, even if the general sentiment is positive.\n\nWait, no, the neutral stance isn't necessarily about the words used but the explicit stance. If the text is just discussing facts without showing support or opposition, it's neutral. For example, \"Vaccines are made from various components to trigger an immune response.\" That's neutral.\n\nSo, going back to the sample, if the text is only thanking someone for sharing a story without any opinion or explicit stance on vaccines, it's neutral, hence NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

They're not directly talking about vaccination, they're talking about the comments they read. \n\nMaybe the user found the comments about vaccination so upsetting that they regret reading them.

Alternatively, the comments could have been supportive, but still, the user found them unwelcome for some other reason.\n\nSince the text doesn't directly express support for or against vaccination, it seems like the stance is neutral. The user is expressing frustration about reading comments, but not clearly stating their own position on vaccination. So, I think the stance should be NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The user wrote, \"I'd add that I know of no religion that forbids getting this information.\" \n\nFirst, I should focus on the content. The statement is about religious beliefs not forbidding the获取 information, which in this context likely refers to vaccination information. \n\nAnalyzing the sentiment, the statement is factual and neutral. The user isn't expressing a positive or negative opinion about vaccination itself but rather clarifying a point about religion and information access.\n\nSince the stance is neutral, the appropriate label is NON.

They're talking about a story that includes statistics on people who are not immunized and an increase in conscientious objectors. Conscientious objectors are people who refuse vaccination, often for personal, ethical, or religious reasons. \n\nNow, the task is to determine the stance: PRO, ANTI, or NON. The user is presenting information about an increase in people opting out of vaccination. This could imply that the user is highlighting a trend of decreasing vaccination rates, which might be a concern from a pro-vaccination viewpoint. Alternatively, it could be a neutral presentation of facts without indicating the user's opinion.\n\nBut the user isn't directly expressing support or opposition. They're just stating that there's an increase in people not getting vaccinated. There’s no emotional language or clear indication of approval or disapproval. Therefore, the stance here is likely neutral because the user is simply reporting data without expressing a pro or anti-vax stance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "212": "Alright, let me try to figure out the stance on vaccination based on the given Facebook text. The text is: \"This came from the comment thread immediately below the post. Um, WTF?????\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sentiment here. The user is reacting to something in the comment thread, using \"WTF,\" which typically stands for \"What the F***.\" That's a strong exclamation, often used to express shock, disbelief, or frustration. The user is clearly reacting to something they saw in the comments below a post.\n\nNow, considering the context, if this reaction is in response to a vaccination-related discussion, I need to assess whether the stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON. But without knowing exactly what the original post or the comments say, I can only infer based on the reaction. \n\nThe user is expressing surprise or anger, which suggests that whatever they read in the comments contradicted their expectations or beliefs. If the comments were supportive of vaccination and the user is upset, that might indicate an ANTI stance. Conversely, if the comments were against vaccination and the user is upset, that could indicate a PRO stance. \n\nHowever, the only indication here is the strong reaction. Strong negative reactions can sometimes indicate a negative stance, but it's not definitive. If the user were upset because someone was spreading misinformation against vaccines, perhaps their stance is PRO. If they were upset because someone was promoting vaccines, maybe their stance is ANTI. But without specific information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, I might tentatively lean towards ANTI if the reaction is to pro-vaccine comments. But this is speculative. If unsure, it's safer to default to NON if the stance isn't clearly evident. Alternatively, considering that the reaction might be to any extreme viewpoint, regardless of direction, it could still be Neutral.\n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is more about the content of the comments than about vaccination itself. Maybe the user is surprised by the level of debate or the intensity of the discussion, which might not directly indicate a stance on vaccination. In that case, the stance would be NON.\n\nI think I'll go with NON because the text doesn't explicitly express a pro or anti sentiment towards vaccination. The reaction is more about being surprised or upset by the comments, without clear indication of which side they're on.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The user is explaining that UFOs exist as unidentified flying objects, not necessarily extraterrestrial spacecraft, but things like large birds, drones, etc. They mention that they remain UFOs until identified, so in that sense, they exist, and UFOlogists are studying something real, albeit with possibly loony conclusions.\n\nI don't see any mention of vaccines, health, government policies, or anything related to medicine. The entire post is about UFOs and their classification. So it seems the user's stance on vaccination isn't addressed here at all.\n\nSince there's no indication of vaccination support, opposition, or neutrality, the stance is neutral.

The text \"This is the best!\" conveys a positive sentiment. While it's brief and doesn't explicitly mention vaccination, the positive sentiment could imply a favorable stance towards vaccination. However, without explicit mentions of vaccination or a clear context, it's safer to classify the stance as 'NON' due to the lack of direct information regarding vaccination.

The content is more about personal struggles and seeking support. There's no positive or negative sentiment towards vaccines.

The user provided this text: \"But, but, but, organic means no pesticides right? RIGHT?!\". Hmm, that's interesting. \n\nLooking at the text, it's talking about organic products and pesticides, not directly about vaccines. So, right away, it doesn't seem related to vaccination. The user is emphasizing that organic means no pesticides, which is a common claim, and they're asserting it with \"RIGHT?!\". \n\nSince the text is about pesticides and organic farming, there's no mention or implication of vaccines. The sentiment here seems to be positive towards organic products because the user is agreeing with the statement and reinforcing it. But the question is about vaccination, not pesticides. \n\nI remember the instructions say to focus solely on the stance towards vaccination, regardless of the general sentiment. So even if the user is positive about organic products, it doesn't affect their stance on vaccines. \n\nThere's nothing in the text that discusses, supports, or opposes vaccination. So the stance towards vaccination must be neutral because there's no information given about it. \n\nTherefore, the correct stance is 'NON' because the user hasn't expressed any positive or negative opinion regarding vaccination.

I'm not familiar with who these individuals are, but given the context of vaccination discussions, I can assume they might be two people with opposing views on vaccination.\n\nThe word \"gold\" is used by the user, which suggests that they are enthusiastic or positive about this video. So, maybe they think the video provides valuable or compelling information.\n\nNow, considering the stance options: \n- PRO means the user is in favor of vaccination. \n- ANTI means the user is against it. \n- NON is neutral.\n\nSince the text is a link, it's hard to tell without knowing the content of the video. However, the user's enthusiasm suggests they might be sharing it because they agree with the content. If \"Viera\" is a proponent of vaccination and \"Bronwyn\" is against, or vice versa, but the user refers to it as \"gold,\" they might be aligning with the views presented.\n\nAlternatively, the link could be of a debate, and the user is merely sharing it without taking a side, which would make the stance NON. But given the use of \"gold,\" it's more likely they are sharing information they find valuable, indicating a stance.\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual content of the video, it's speculative. Therefore, the safest answer is that the stance is NON because we can't determine the user's position based on the text alone. The link doesn't explicitly show support or opposition to vaccination; it's a neutral action of sharing a video.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze the Text**: The user shared a video link with the comment \"this is gold.\" The video is between Viera and Bronwyn, which are likely individuals discussing vaccination.\n\n2. **Evaluate Sentiment**: The use of \"gold\" indicates enthusiasm but doesn't clarify the viewpoint on vaccination.\n\n3. **Determine Stance**: Since the text only shares a link without explicit support or opposition, we consider the stance as neutral.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "218": "Alright, I'm looking at the user's query about stance on vaccination. The text is a personal favorite, with no direct mention of vaccines.

    "219": "Alright, so I'm looking at this query from the user. They want me to determine the stance of a given Facebook text regarding vaccination. The possible stances are 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. The key point they emphasized is to look at the stance regardless of the general sentiment. So even if the text has a negative sentiment overall, if the stance towards vaccination is positive, I need to mark it as 'PRO', and vice versa.\n\nLet me break down the example provided. The user gives an example where the text is \"Normality - for my 11 year old daughter\", and the stance is 'NON'. Hmm, that's interesting. The text doesn't explicitly mention anything positive or negative about vaccination. It's more about normality in general, which could be interpreted in many ways. It might not be related to vaccination at all, so the neutrality makes sense here.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to approach this in general. When someone provides a text, I have to analyze whether their stance towards vaccination is positive, negative, or neutral, regardless of how the text feels overall. For instance, if someone says, \"I hate vaccines because they caused my child's autism,\" despite the negative sentiment, the stance is 'ANTI'. On the flip side, if someone writes, \"Vaccines are bad, but I still got my child vaccinated,\" the general sentiment is negative, but the stance is 'PRO' because the action taken was pro-vaccine.\n\nI should be careful not to assume the stance based on the overall sentiment. The user is clear that the stance is independent of the sentiment. So, the task is more about extracting the explicit or implicit support or opposition towards vaccination, not the mood of the text.\n\nLet me think about possible challenges. One is texts that are neutral on the surface but have underlying implications. For example, \"I'm undecided about vaccinating my child.\" That's neutral in stance, so 'NON'. Another challenge is texts that determined by context. If the text uses a metaphor or an analogy without explicitly stating a stance, that could be tricky. But I think the user expects straightforward analysis based on the text's content.\n\nAlso, the user specified that the response should be in JSON format, with only the 'stance' key, using one of the three options. They don't want any explanations or additional text. So, the output needs to be precise.\n\nI should also remember not to invent anything. If the stance is unclear, then I should default to 'NON'. It's better to be cautious and mark ambiguity as neutral rather than make assumptions.\n\nLet me think of some test cases to validate this understanding. \n\nTest case 1:\nText: \"Vaccines save lives. My children are vaccinated.\"\nStance: 'PRO' because the text explicitly supports vaccination.\n\nTest case 2:\nText: \"I think vaccines are harmful, but I still vaccinated my child due to school requirements.\"\nStance: 'PRO' because despite the negative sentiment, the action taken is pro-vaccine.\n\nTest case 3:\nText: \"Vaccination has caused many problems and is not necessary.\"\nStance: 'ANTI' even though there's a negative sentiment.\n\nTest case 4:\nText: \"I'm not sure about the benefits of vaccines. I'm still researching.\"\nStance: 'NON' because there's no clear stance; it's undecided.\n\nTest case 5:\nText: \"It's every parent's right to choose. I chose not to vaccinate.\"\nStance: 'ANTI' because the choice is against vaccination.\n\nWait, but in test case 5, the stance is against even though the sentiment might be presented as a value statement. It's important to read beyond the overall sentiment to focus on the stance.\n\nAnother test case:\nText: \"Vaccines are a hoax, and I won't allow my child to get them.\"\nStance: 'ANTI' clearly because it's opposing vaccination.\n\nAnd a neutral one:\nText: \"The vaccine rollout is happening, but there's a lot of misinformation out there.\"\nStance: 'NON' because it doesn't explicitly support or oppose vaccination; it's more about misinformation.\n\nI think I've got a good grasp of how to approach this. Now, to make sure I'm not making any assumptions beyond what the text says. Each text should be analyzed for explicit or implicit support, opposition, or neutrality towards vaccination.\n\nOne more thing to consider is the context of the text. If it's a statement of fact without opinion, it might be 'NON'. If it's a call to action, it's likely either 'PRO' or 'ANTI'. For example:\nText: \"Join me in supporting vaccination a healthcare worker who administers vaccines.\"\nStance: 'PRO'\n\nOr\nText: \"Petition to stop mandatory vaccination laws.\"\nStance: 'ANTI'\n\nIn these cases, the call to action or advocacy is clear, so the stance is determined by the direction of the action.\n\nIn summary, my approach should be methodical:\n1. Read the text carefully.\n2. Identify any explicit support or opposition towards vaccination.\n3. If support is found, mark as 'PRO'; if opposition, mark as 'ANTI'.\n4. If the text doesn't indicate a clear stance or is neutral, mark as 'NON'.\n5. Ensure that the general sentiment doesn't influence the stance determination.\n\nBy following these steps, I can accurately determine the stance as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

It's talking about \"antivaxxer aliens.\" The term \"antivaxxer\" typically refers to someone who opposes vaccination. So, it's describing aliens who are against vaccines. They were banned from their planet because they refuse to vaccinate their children. Now, they're looking for humans who share their views, i.e., other anti-vaxxers.\n\nNow, the instruction says to determine the stance regardless of the general sentiment. But in this case, the sentiment seems to be negative towards vaccination because the aliens are characterized as antivaxxers. They’re the ones being banned for not vaccinating, and they're seeking others who agree with them. So this text is promoting the anti-vaxxer perspective by describing them positively (they're looking for like-minded humans) even though the action of being banned could be seen as negative.\n\nI should consider whether the user is expressing a positive stance towards vaccination or a negative one. Since they're referring to people (aliens) who are against vaccination and are seeking others with the same views, it seems the user is aligning with the anti-vaxxer stance. Therefore, the stance here is ANTI.\n\nI have to be careful not to confuse the general sentiment of the text with the user's stance.

Without any direct connection to vaccination, I can't assume a stance. \n\nLooking at the options: NON, ANTI, PRO.

The user is making a joke about alkalinity, which is a topic related to health, but it's not directly mentioning vaccines or immunization. There's no indication of support or opposition to vaccination here. The comment is more about a general health topic and is phrased in a questioning, perhaps dismissive manner, but again, not specifically about vaccines.\n\nI need to determine if the stance is PRO, ANTI, or NON. Since the text doesn't mention vaccination at all, it's neutral in terms of stance towards it.

The user mentioned, \"Vê os comentários Laura Sofia Carvalho.\" Translating that, it means, \"Check the comments Laura Sofia Carvalho.\" But without the actual content of those comments, it's difficult to determine the stance. However, the user's instruction is clear: extract the stance regardless of the general sentiment.\n\nIn the example provided, the assistant responded with {\"stance\": \"NON\"}. This suggests that when the text doesn't clearly express a positive or negative opinion towards vaccination, the stance is classified as neutral. \n\nSo, if I were to approach this, I would look for keywords or phrases that indicate support, opposition, or neutrality towards vaccination. For example, if the comments were talking about the benefits of vaccines, that would lean towards 'PRO'. If they were discussing concerns or negative experiences, that would be closer to 'ANTI'. If the comments are more factual or not expressing a clear opinion, then it's 'NON'.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the context of the comments.

Instead, it seems to be using a metaphor about a child playing in traffic. \n\nI think the metaphor is comparing not vaccinating a child to allowing them to play in traffic, which is inherently dangerous. By saying \"we'll remember that,\" it suggests that the user thinks the other person's choice (referring to not vaccinating) will have negative consequences. \n\nSo, this seems to imply that the user supports vaccination because they view not vaccinating as a reckless decision. They're essentially saying that the consequences of not vaccinating (like the child getting sick) will be remembered, much like the dangers of playing in traffic. \n\nTherefore, the stance here is positive towards vaccination. They are pro-vaccine because they're highlighting the risks of not vaccinating, equating it to a dangerous situation. \n\nIt's important to note that while the general sentiment of the text might seem negative (criticizing the other person's decision), the stance towards vaccination is positive.

The statement is more about how information is presented, rather than taking a stance on vaccines themselves.\n\nSince there's no clear indication of support for or opposition against vaccination, the stance should be neutral. The user is expressing frustration with the way issues are dichotomized, not taking a side on the vaccines. Therefore, the stance is 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "232": "Alright, let's see. The user provided a query where they want to determine another user's stance towards vaccination based on a Facebook text. The instructions specify to use one of three options: NON, ANTI, or PRO. The example given is a text complaining about the internet, with the stance being NON. \n\nSo, in this case, the Facebook text is \"What a freaking nightmare. We should close internet for a while.\" The user expressing frustration about the internet. Now, the task is to find if there's any indication of stance towards vaccination. Since the text doesn't mention anything about vaccination or health, the stance towards vaccination can't be determined. Therefore, the correct answer is NON.\n\nI need to ensure that the response is a JSON file with the key \"stance\" and the value as \"NON\".

The person is asking for more details about a complaint and whether findings were published. They mention health service complaints being investigated and findings usually being published. \n\nThere's no mention of vaccination here. The conversation seems to be about a complaint process in a health service context. Since there's no direct or indirect reference to vaccination, the user's stance can't be determined.

So even if the text has a negative general sentiment, the stance towards vaccination could be positive, and vice versa.\n\nThe text given is: \"He's 'enjoying' it is he? I think he'd much prefer be snuggled up and safe.\" \n\nHmm, let's break it down. The user is talking about someone (he) who is supposedly enjoying something. But the user corrects that by saying they think he would prefer to be snuggled up and safe. The wording implies that the person is not really enjoying the situation but would rather be safe.\n\nI need to figure out if this relates to vaccination. If the context is about getting a vaccine, the person might not enjoy the experience (like the shot or the process), but the user believes it's better for him to be safe. That would indicate a positive stance towards vaccination because the user values safety, which is linked to vaccines.\n\nAlternatively, if the discussion is about someone not wanting to get vaccinated and preferring to stay home instead, that could indicate an anti stance. But without context, it's tricky. However, the user is suggesting the person would prefer being safe, implying vaccination as a safe measure.\n\nSo the stance here is PRO vaccination.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

They mentioned that if someone says \"Get vaccinated, it's the best way to stay safe,\" that's PRO. Another example, \"Vaccines cause autism,\" that's ANTI. And \"I'm not sure about vaccines, but they might work,\" that's NON.\n\nLooking at the text: \"Just a shill for Big Pulley.\" The word \"shill\" usually means someone who promotes something, often in an deceptive or biased way. So the user is accusing someone else of being a shill for \"Big Pulley.\" I'm not exactly sure who or what \"Big Pulley\" refers to, but in the context of the examples given, I think it's meant to imply a company or organization promoting vaccines.\n\nSo someone being a shill would mean they are pushing a pro-vaccine agenda. Therefore, if the user is calling someone a shill, they must be against that agenda. That would lean towards an ANTI stance on vaccination because they are critical of the promotion of vaccines.\n\nI should also remember that the stance doesn't necessarily have to match the overall sentiment of the text. Even if the text is negative, the stance could be positive or negative. But in this case, since they are calling out a proponent as a shill, it seems like the user is against vaccination.\n\nSo putting it together, the stance here should be ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",

It could mean they're reacting to something Judith said or did. But that's about the sentiment of the statement, not necessarily their stance on vaccination. \n\nSince there's no mention of vaccination, health, or related terms, it's tricky. The user is reacting to someone else's post or comment, but without knowing what Judith said, I can't link it to vaccination. \n\nIf Judith's comment was about vaccination, then the user's reaction would indicate their stance. But since the message doesn't provide that context, I can't make a connection. \n\nTherefore, there's no clear indication of a positive, negative, or neutral stance on vaccination here. The message doesn't address vaccination at all, so the stance remains neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe user's message doesn't reference vaccination, making it impossible to determine their stance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The user is making a point about the biology of conception, saying that anal sex doesn't result in pregnancy, and seems to find the idea ridiculous. \n\nGoing back to the instructions, I need to extract the stance towards vaccination regardless of the general sentiment. But since the text is about baby-making, not vaccinations, there's no direct or indirect mention of vaccines here. The user isn't discussing any medical opinions, public health, or treatments related to vaccination. The sentiment towards the statement about conception is negative, but that's unrelated to vaccination. \n\nSo, considering all this, the stance towards vaccination isn't mentioned or inferred.

From what I know, some anti-vaccination groups might have ties to certain political movements, but in this case, the user didn't mention anything about vaccines. They're purely talking about communism. \n\nSince there's no mention of vaccines or any related话题 like health policies, medical treatments, or government mandates, it's hard to connect this statement to vaccination. The user's stance towards communism doesn't inherently indicate a pro, anti, or neutral stance towards vaccines. \n\nAlso, the user's tone is positive towards communism, but without any link to vaccination, we can't assume they have a positive or negative view towards vaccines.

The text mentions vitamin C, immune system, and treatments for colds, but there's no mention of vaccines or vaccination.

The possible options are NON, ANTI, or PRO. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. The speaker is agreeing with John, mentioning that a LiveJournal blog is a reliable source. LiveJournal is a blogging platform where users can share their thoughts and experiences. It's not a traditional news outlet or a peer-reviewed journal, so the reliability can be subjective.\n\nThe key here is the phrase \"Reliable source.\" By asserting that a LiveJournal blog is reliable, the speaker is taking a stance on the credibility of such sources. They're supporting the use of this platform as a trustworthy reference. \n\nNow, considering the context where such a statement might be made. If someone is promoting vaccinations and references a LiveJournal blog as a reliable source, that would be a PRO stance. Conversely, if someone is criticizing vaccination and using such a source, it might indicate a negative stance. However, in this case, the text itself doesn't specify the topic. It's just a general statement about the reliability of a LiveJournal blog.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, I have to determine the stance towards vaccination. Wait, no—the user says to look at the stance of the text, regardless of the general sentiment. The text in question is about the reliability of a source, which is a different issue.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The task is to give the stance of the text regarding Facebook and vaccination. Wait, no—it says \"Give me the stance of the text, regardless of the general sentiment expressed in the text.\" So the text provided is an example. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe text is \"Right John, because a livejournal blog is a reliable source.\" The user is asking to determine the stance towards the text. Wait, no—perhaps the text is referring to Facebook's stance on vaccination. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me read the initial prompt again. The user says: \"Give me the stance of Facebook text, regardless of the general sentiment expressed in the text.\" So the example text is a Facebook text, and I need to determine if the stance is ANTI, PRO, or NON regarding vaccination.\n\nIn the provided example text, the user writes: \"Right John, because a livejournal blog is a Reliable source.\" So they're agreeing with John and citing a LiveJournal blog as reliable. \n\nNow, if the context is about vaccination, the stance here is PRO if they're supporting vaccination through reliable sources. Conversely, if they're criticizing vaccination sources, it might be ANTI. But in this case, the statement is more about the credibility of the source rather than directly expressing a stance towards vaccination.\n\nSince the text is agreeing with John and affirming the reliability of the source, without opposing or supporting vaccination directly, the stance might be considered PRO. Alternatively, if it's a source that's being criticized, it could be ANTI. But here, they're agreeing that it's reliable.\n\nHowever, considering that a LiveJournal blog is not typically a formally credible source, some might consider it as a less reliable source, which could be seen as doubting official sources, potentially ANTI. But the user is affirming its reliability, so it's positive.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Since it's a neutral statement about the source, maybe it's better to label it as NON. Alternatively, supporting a source can imply support for the information, so maybe PRO.\n\nI think I'll lean towards PRO because the speaker is affirming the source's reliability, which could be in support of a vaccination stance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

I don't see any mention of vaccination here. It's all about gratitude towards people who organized or participated in these events.\n\nThe user's general sentiment seems positive because they are thanking others. But the instruction is to focus strictly on the stance towards vaccination, not the overall sentiment.

But the text doesn't mention vaccines. They're focusing on human augmentation versus mechanical methods.\n\nSo, the user is against modifying human genetics but seems open to mechanical enhancements. But how does this relate to vaccination? Unless they're concerned about vaccines altering genetics, but that's not clear here.\n\nSince the text doesn't directly mention vaccines, I think the stance is neutral.

However, the way it's phrased seems like the user is refuting that claim, especially since they were just talking about correcting a woo interpretation. \n\nThey end with, \"If it harms your sensitivities, simply don't comment.\" This might be a way to protect themselves from backlash, indicating they stand by their corrected statement.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is correcting someone who might be against vaccines, possibly linking them to ADHD, by pointing out that such claims are based on incorrect interpretations or linked to selling something unrelated.

Thank you!\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user is appreciating healthcare professionals who take steps to protect themselves, coworkers, and patients. This appreciation implies approval or support for the actions those professionals are taking. \n\nIn this context, the \"steps\" they're referring to could be related to vaccination since healthcare workers often get vaccinated to protect themselves and their patients. But the text doesn't explicitly mention vaccination. However, the sentiment expressed is positive towards those who take protective measures, which is often linked to vaccination efforts in public health contexts.\n\nConsidering the user's language, words like \"appreciate,\" \"thank you,\" and \"protect\" all indicate a positive sentiment. Even though the text doesn't directly talk about vaccines, the implication is that the user supports the protective actions, which are likely vaccination-related.\n\nThe user is expressing gratitude towards these professionals, which suggests they agree with and endorse the measures being taken. This alignment with protective health measures points towards a positive stance on vaccination. \n\nSo, the stance here isn't neutral because the user is clearly showing approval. It's not negative either, since the user is thanking and appreciating the efforts.

These types of parties are associated with the anti-vaccination movement because they promote deliberate exposure to diseases to encourage natural immunity without vaccination.\n\nThe user calls the person a DJ at these parties. Using the term \"DJ\" in this context is likely meant as a playful or exaggerated way to describe someone who hosts these events. The use of \"3:)\" at the end seems like a smiley or an emoji, possibly indicating that the user is making a joke or being sarcastic.\n\nHowever, the mention of the parties themselves is the key point. Since measles and chicken pox parties are strongly linked to anti-vaccination views, it's reasonable to infer that the user is adopting a stance that supports these parties, which in turn is anti-vaccination.\n\nEven though the general sentiment of the text might not be overtly negative towards vaccination, the context strongly suggests an anti-vaccination stance.

If vaccination was misrepresented or led to negative outcomes in their view, they might be anti. Conversely, if the disillusionment is about anti-vaccine misinformation being exposed, they might be pro.\n\nBut wait, without direct mention of vaccines or specifics, can I infer? If the user is reacting to something related to vaccines that made them disillusioned, their stance could be anti if they were let down by vaccines, or pro if they were let down by anti-vaccine claims.\n\nHowever, since the mention of vaccination isn't explicit, it's safer to default to \"NON.\" They didn't clearly express a pro or anti stance, just a negative sentiment about something they watched.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",

The text is happy but doesn't mention vaccination directly. So it's neutral.\n\nHmm, the user is asking to extract stance regardless of sentiment. So I need to check if the text has any mention of vaccination or related terms. If it does, determine if it's pro, anti, or neutral. If it doesn't, stance is neutral.\n\nIn this case, the text doesn't mention vaccination, so stance is \"NON\". But if it did mention, say, \"Vaccines are important\" – that's pro. \"Avoid vaccines\" would be anti.\n\nI should make sure I don't confuse the stance with general sentiment. For example, a user could express negative sentiment overall but still support vaccination.\n\nSo, in my analysis, I need to:\n\n1. Check if the text discusses vaccination or related terms.\n2. If yes, determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral stance.\n3. If no mention, stance is neutral.\n\nAlso, need to be careful with indirect mentions. Maybe terms like \"shots\", \"medications\" could relate, but not always.\n\nI need to apply this logic consistently.

So there's no mention of vaccines here. The user is seeking an explanation and expressing interest, but it's not about vaccination.\n\nSince there's no reference to vaccination at all, the stance can't be determined either pro, anti, or neutral towards it.

Without any mentions of vaccines, pro-vaccine arguments, or anti-vaccine sentiments, I can't determine a stance. There's no clear indication of support or opposition to vaccination here. The question is more about social media conflicts, not vaccination itself.\n\nSo, since the text doesn't express any position on vaccination, the stance should be neutral.

They're a paediatric nurse, which is a healthcare profession, and they're talking about their colleagues. The phrase \"spruik the bollocks\" means promoting something they don't agree with. The AVSN is the Australian Veterinary Society Network, but in this context, it seems the user is referring to anti-vax sentiment.\n\nThey express disappointment that any colleagues would be anti-vax, which indicates they support vaccination. So, despite not explicitly stating \"I support vaccines,\" their disappointment with anti-vax stance suggests they are pro-vaccine. \n\nI should make sure I'm capturing the stance accurately, regardless of general sentiment.

But now the user has a different statement: \"Cause bangers and mash are so good for you.\" \n\nHmm, okay. So in the previous examples, the stance was determined from text related to vaccination. Here, the text is about food. It doesn't mention anything about vaccines, health policies, or related topics. \n\nI need to extract the stance, but since the text is about food, not vaccines, how do I approach this? The user might have provided this as a test or perhaps they made a typo. But regardless, based on the given text, there's no mention of vaccination or anything related to it. \n\nSo, the stance towards vaccination isn't addressed here.

The person is dismissing the study as proof. The stance can be either PRO, ANTI, or NON.\n\nI need to parse the text for any clues. The user is dismissing the Burbacher study, which might be referenced by someone else. Burbacher is known for studies on thimerosal in vaccines. By saying the study isn't proof, the user might be supporting vaccines, implying the study doesn't show harm. So the stance is Positive (PRO).\n\nI should make sure not to misinterpret the dismissal. If dismissing the study implies not finding it a reason against vaccines, that's PRO.

This bill should be passed nationally.\" Hmm.\n\nThe user is addressing \"anti-vaxxers,\" which are people against vaccination. They are implying that the reason the anti-vaxxers' children are healthy is because of the vaccinated kids. So, the user is arguing in favor of vaccination. They also mention a bill that should be passed nationally, which probably relates to vaccination policies. \n\nThe words used are critical of anti-vaxxers, showing the user's disagreement with their stance. The user is in support of vaccination because they believe that it's protecting the anti-vaxxers' children. So, the stance is positive towards vaccination.\n\nThere's nothing neutral here because the user is clearly taking a side.

They're emphasizing that parents should consider the consequences of the risks they decide upon for their children. The phrasing here is about thinking through the potential outcomes of their choices, which could relate to various decisions, including vaccination.\n\nNow, considering the context of vaccination, this statement doesn't explicitly mention vaccines, but it's about evaluating risks. In discussions about vaccination, people often weigh the risks of getting vaccinated versus not getting vaccinated. Here, the user isn't taking a specific stance but is instead encouraging parents to consider the possible risks of their decisions.\n\nSince the user isn't advocating for or against vaccination, but rather emphasizing the importance of evaluating risks, their stance is neutral.

So, for any given Facebook text, I need to extract the stance towards vaccination, not the general sentiment.\n\nI should analyze the text for any explicit words or phrases that indicate support, opposition, or neutrality towards vaccination. For instance, words like 'vaccines are safe', 'get vaccinated' would be PRO. Words like 'vaccines are harmful', 'avoid vaccines' would be ANTI. Neutral statements like facts without opinion or unrelated comments would be NON.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Sometimes, the text might have negative sentiment overall but still support vaccination. For example, if someone is complaining about the administration process but still promotes vaccination, it's PRO.\n\nThe key is to focus solely on the stance towards vaccination, ignoring the general sentiment. Also, the response should strictly be one of the three values, nothing else.\n\nIf the text doesn't mention vaccination at all, or the mention is neutral, the stance is NON. If it clearly supports or opposes vaccination, then PRO or ANTI respectively.\n\nTesting this, for the example given, the text was about compensation, not vaccination.

But in this case, the user's text isn't directly about vaccination. \n\nHmm, they're talking about thesis approval, which doesn't relate to vaccines at all. So, there's no clear stance on vaccination here. The user is critical of the approval process but hasn't mentioned anything about vaccines, pro or anti. \n\nI think the correct stance should be 'NON' because the text doesn't express any opinion about vaccination.

Let me break down the reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, the question is about extracting the stance regardless of the general sentiment. The possible stances are NON (neutral), ANTI (negative), or PRO (positive). The key here is not to be swayed by the overall sentiment but to focus specifically on the user's stance on vaccination.\n\nLooking at the text: \"The moment I hear 'gut' is when I stop listening to a person...\" This is a response to someone else's statement, possibly mentioning something about vaccination, but it's not clear. The mention of \"gut\" might refer to the gut microbiome, which is a common talking point in discussions about vaccines. Maybe the original conversation was about how vaccines affect the gut, a common argument against vaccines.\n\nHowever, the user's response is about stopping listening when they hear \"gut.\" This could indicate frustration or dismissal towards the other person's point. But does this directly show a stance on vaccination?\n\nThe user didn't explicitly state their opinion on vaccines. They didn't say they're for or against vaccination; they just expressed irritation when a certain word is used. This reaction could be taken in different ways. They might be upset because the word brings up misinformation, or they could be dismissive of someone who uses the term in their argument.\n\nSince the user's response doesn't directly take a stance but rather expresses frustration at hearing a particular term, it's difficult to determine a clear pro or anti stance. They might be neutral towards vaccination but frustrated with how the topic is discussed. Alternatively, their frustration could indicate a disagreement with the argument being made, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate stance based on the given text is neutral (NON) because the user's response doesn't clearly support or oppose vaccination. It's more about their reaction to a term rather than a direct statement about vaccines.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",

Then, they mention that if Ken is talking about something \"unreasonable elsewhere,\" he should clarify or provide a link. \n\nI need to determine the stance here. The key here is that the user is supporting Ken's advice by calling it reasonable. That suggests that the user agrees with Ken's stance, which, if Ken is talking about vaccination, implies that the user is in favor of it. The mention of clarifying \"unreasonable elsewhere\" might be about other contexts, but the primary part is the positive support of the advice given. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is agreeing with the advice, which would likely be in support of vaccination. Therefore, the stance is 'PRO'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",

The text given is: \"LOL thats funny they expect you to start dolling out medical advice\". The user is responding with a laughing face and calling it funny that someone expects them to give medical advice.\n\nLooking at the content, the user is making a humorous comment about others expecting them to provide medical advice. They aren't expressing a stance on vaccination directly. It seems more like a reaction to someone else's expectations rather than a statement about vaccines themselves.\n\nSo, to determine the stance, I need to see if there's any positive, negative, or neutral vibe towards vaccination. Since the user isn't discussing vaccines but rather the expectation of giving advice, it seems neutral. They're not supporting or opposing vaccination; they're just finding the situation funny.\n\nI also have to remember that the general sentiment doesn't dictate the stance. Even if the sentiment is negative or positive, the stance is solely about their view on vaccination based on the text. Here, there's no direct mention or implication about being for or against vaccines, so the stance should be neutral.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate stance here is 'NON'.

Hmm, so the user is sharing information that's skeptical about vaccines, questioning their validity without proper references. That sounds like they're against vaccination.\n\nI need to map this to one of the stance options: 'NON', 'ANTI', or 'PRO'. Since the text is promoting doubt about vaccines, it's likely an 'ANTI' stance, even though the overall sentiment might not be explicitly negative elsewhere.\n\nSo the response should be a JSON file with the key \"stance\" and the value \"ANTI\".

Hmm, that's interesting because the text doesn't mention anything about vaccination. It's talking about magazines. So, I guess in this case, the stance is neutral because the text is unrelated to the topic of vaccination. \n\nThe key here is that regardless of the general sentiment of the text, which could be negative, positive, or neutral, we're solely focusing on whether the text expresses a stance towards vaccination. If the text doesn't mention or relate to vaccination at all, the stance is considered neutral (NON). \n\nSo, in processing the user's request, I need to analyze each text to see if it contains any information, sentiment, or indirect clues about the sender's stance on vaccination. If it does, then classify it as PRO or ANTI based on the expressed opinion, regardless of the text's overall sentiment. If it doesn't, then it's NON.\n\nAnother example might be helpful. Suppose the text is \"I just got my vaccine, feeling so much better now!\" That clearly shows a positive stance towards vaccination, so the answer would be PRO. Conversely, a text like \"I refuse to get vaccinated, it's dangerous!\" would be ANTI. But a text like \"The weather today is really nice,\" with no mention of vaccination, would be NON.\n\nTherefore, the main task is to detect any mention or implication about vaccination in the text.

The link is a news article, but I can't access it. So, I'm relying on the text provided.\n\nThe main point is the consequence of not vaccinating children against tetanus. The implication is that not vaccinating leads to negative outcomes, which would be tetanus cases. This suggests the poster is showing the importance of vaccination.\n\nI don't see any negative words about vaccines themselves, but rather a negative outcome of not vaccinating. So the stance is promoting vaccination by showing what happens without it. That would be a PRO stance because it supports vaccination by highlighting the benefits (in this case, the avoidance of a serious disease).\n\nI should double-check to make sure it's not neutral or anti.

The user is talking about \"the same old screed\" which usually implies something repetitive or tiresome. It's followed by \"by the selfish ones who get a free ride on herd immunity.\" So, the user is referring to those who don't vaccinate, relying on herd immunity, and calling them selfish.\n\nNow, \"herd immunity\" is a concept where enough people in a community are vaccinated to prevent the spread of disease to vulnerable individuals who can't be vaccinated. People who avoid vaccination may indirectly benefit from this, which the user is criticizing as a \"free ride.\"\n\nThe term \"selfish ones\" is a strong word, indicating that the user views those who don't vaccinate as being self-centered and not considering the greater good. The overall tone seems negative towards those who refuse vaccination, which could imply that the user supports vaccination.\n\nLet me consider the general sentiment. The sentiment towards the people mentioned is negative, but that doesn't necessarily translate to their stance on vaccination. Sometimes people express frustration towards people's choices without explicitly stating their own stance.\n\nHowever, in this case, by labeling those who don't vaccinate as selfish, the user is indirectly supporting the idea of vaccination for the benefit of the community.

Without clear context, it's challenging to attribute the stance to vaccination matters.\n\nIf I consider that the user might be expressing frustration towards people who oppose vaccination, then the stance could be 'PRO' as the user might be criticizing anti-vaxxers. Alternatively, if the frustration is towards people getting vaccinated, the stance might be 'ANTI'. However, since the text doesn't specifically mention vaccination, it's safer to default to 'NON'.\n\nI should ensure the response is strictly in JSON format as specified, without any additional explanations. So, the best response is {'stance': 'NON'}.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",
    "285": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance of the user towards vaccination based on the provided Facebook text. The user wrote, \"Good on them! We need to stand up against these airy fairy bloody anti-vaxers. Nz needs to do the same.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the text. The user starts with \"Good on them!\", which is a positive expression. Then they mention standing up against \"airy fairy bloody anti-vaxers.\" The term \"anti-vaxers\" refers to people who oppose vaccination, so the user is criticizing those people. \n\nThe use of strong language like \"bloody\" adds emphasis to their negative opinion of anti-vaxers. By saying \"stand up against,\" the user is advocating for a stance against anti-vaxers, which implies support for vaccination. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that \"Nz needs to do the same,\" which suggests they want New Zealand to take action, possibly to promote vaccination. \n\nPutting it all together, the user is clearly against the anti-vax movement and supports vaccination. So their stance is pro-vaccination.\n</think>\n\nThe user's stance is PRO. They criticize anti-vaxers and advocate for vaccination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "286": "Alright, let's analyze the user's stance towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user mentions that without essential oils, people back then had it worse. They're thanking God for essential oils that have been studied by \"googleologists\" and implying these oils have cured diseases. The user also critiques scientists and pharmaceutical companies, taking credit for cures. \n\nThis suggests the user believes essential oils are the real cure, not traditional medicine or vaccines. They're likely expressing distrust in conventional medical practices, including vaccines. So, their stance isn't just against vaccinations—they're anti the broader medical establishment. Therefore, the stance is ANTI.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "287": "Alright, so the user provided a query asking for the stance towards vaccination from a given Facebook text. They mentioned that even texts with negative sentiment can have a positive stance, so the focus is solely on the stance, regardless of overall sentiment.\n\nThe user's example shows that the response should be in JSON format with the key \"stance\" and one of the values: NON, ANTI, or PRO. They emphasized not to include any explanations or to invent any stance.\n\nLooking at the response provided, which is {\"stance\": \"NON\"}, it seems that the stance is neutral. The example text, \"You were young! So sorry,\" doesn't clearly indicate a stance on vaccination. It could be a response to a situation where someone was young and possibly affected by a health issue, but without more context, it's hard to determine a stance. So, the neutral stance makes sense here.\n\nThe user's instructions are clear, so I need to make sure that the model strictly follows them. They don't want any explanations, just the JSON. Also, the response must adhere to RFC8259 standards, meaning it has to be valid JSON without any extra characters or markdown.\n\nI should also consider the example provided by the user to ensure understanding. The example query's response is a neutral stance, which makes sense given the ambiguity of the text provided. If the text were more explicit, the stance could be different. For instance, if the text praised vaccination, the stance would be PRO, but since it's neutral, NON is the right choice.\n\nI need to make sure that the model doesn't overcomplicate things. Even if the overall sentiment of the text is negative, the stance itself is what's important here, not the sentiment. So the model should focus solely on whether the text is promoting, opposing, or neutral about vaccination.\n\nAlso, considering the lack of specific information, it's safer to default to a neutral stance. Without clear indicators, assigning a pro or anti stance could be misleading. The user emphasized not inventing, so without explicit information, sticking to neutral is appropriate.\n\nIn summary, the model should analyze the text, determine if there's a clear pro, anti, or neutral stance, and respond accordingly in the specified JSON format, without any additional explanation.\n</think>\n\n{\"stance\": \"NON\"}",
    "288": "Alright, I'm trying to determine the stance of the given text regarding Facebook's stance on Facebook. The original instruction was to identify if it's NON, ANTI, or PRO. Let me break it down.\n\nThe text says, \"I have met several people who have been persecuted by the Taliban. Their stories are horrific. Perhaps Ms Dorey would like to come and listen to them before she makes such offensive statements.\"\n\nFirst, I note that the text is about persecution by the Taliban and criticizes Ms Dorey's statements as offensive. However, the user wants the stance regarding Facebook. I don't see any mentions of Facebook in the text. There's no indication of support or opposition towards Facebook's policies or stance.\n\nSince there's no content related to Facebook, the stance must be neutral. Therefore, the answer is NON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "289": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance of the user towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user wrote, \"If the measles outbreak that started at Disneyland last year didn't show what happens when vaccination rates drop, I give up.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the sentence. They're talking about a measles outbreak linked to Disneyland, which is a real event. The user mentions that this outbreak shows the consequences when vaccination rates drop. So they're pointing out the relation between lower vaccination rates and disease outbreaks.\n\nI think the key here is their implication. The phrase \"I give up\" is a bit tricky. It could be interpreted as frustration, but in this context, it's more of a rhetorical way to emphasize the point that the measles outbreak was a clear indicator that lower vaccination leads to problems. So it's not expressing skepticism about vaccines, but rather concern about low vaccination rates causing issues.\n\nThe user isn't explicitly saying they support or oppose vaccines, but they're highlighting the negative consequences of low vaccination rates. This suggests that they value vaccination as a tool to prevent such outbreaks. So their stance is in favor of vaccination.\n\nTherefore, the stance is PRO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "290": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance of the user towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user provided a specific note about using one of the three words: NON, ANTI, or PRO, and to put it in a JSON format without any explanations. \n\nLooking at the text: the user starts by mentioning that the same company, CSL, makes both anti-venom and vaccines. They then argue that if someone opposes vaccines because they believe they're deceptive or full of dangerous levels of mercury, aluminum, etc., then those people should also distrust other products, like anti-venom. The user ends by saying that all anti-vaxxers should refuse any emergency treatment because they can't trust life-saving medications, and they added several exclamation marks for emphasis.\n\nThe general sentiment of the text seems negative towards anti-vaxxers, but the user is responding to that by highlighting the inconsistency in distrust. However, I need to focus solely on the stance towards vaccination, not the sentiment against anti-vaxxers. The user is pointing out that if you distrust vaccines for certain reasons, you should extend that distrust to other pharmaceuticals, which suggests they are critical of the anti-vax stance. \n\nBut the user's argument is more about the inconsistency of anti-vax beliefs rather than directly supporting or opposing vaccination. They're not explicitly saying vaccines are good or bad but are challenging the logic of not trusting vaccines while trusting other medications from the same company. So, it doesn't clearly show a PRO stance towards vaccination. It's more of a critique of the anti-vax position, which is a stance against anti-vaxxers, but the user is not taking a clear pro-vaccine position themselves.\n\nWait, the user says that anti-vaxxers should refuse emergency treatments because they can't trust medications. This is presented as a criticism, implying that it's illogical or harmful. So the user is against the anti-vax stance, taking an ANTI stance against anti-vaxxers. But the question is about the stance towards vaccination, not towards anti-vaxxers. In this context, the user's stance towards vaccination itself is that they are necessary and trusting them, hence PRO. But perhaps the user is more neutral because they're arguing against the position rather than advocating for it.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's main point is to criticize anti-vaxxers for being inconsistent, it might mean they support vaccination, hence PRO. However, the text doesn't explicitly state that they are pro-vaccine. It's more about challenging the anti-vax arguments. So maybe the stance is neutral because the user is neither clearly pro nor anti; they're addressing the anti-vax community's stance.\n\nWait, but the user is suggesting that anti-vaxxers should also distrust other medications, implying that vaccines are trustworthy. By pointing out the inconsistency, the user is arguing in favor of vaccines, hence a PRO stance.\n\nAlternatively, the user is neutral because they're not taking a side but pointing out a flaw in the anti-vax argument. However, the strong implication is that vaccines are trustworthy, so the stance is PRO.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The user is saying that if you don't trust vaccines because of reasons, you should distrust other products, which seems to imply that not trusting vaccines is wrong because it leads to other distrusts that are not justified. Therefore, the user is against the anti-vax stance, so they have a PRO stance towards vaccines.\n\nWait, the user uses sarcasm or strong language against anti-vaxxers. They end with \"!!!!\" which shows strong emotion. The point is to argue that anti-vaxxers are being inconsistent and, therefore, vaccines should be trusted. So yes, the stance is PRO towards vaccination.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "291": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the stance of the user towards vaccination based on the given Facebook text. The user's message says: \"Please consider joining our mailing list should the anti-vaxxers ever get the page taken down again. Thanks! http://goo.gl/forms/YLJ3KkoEqECP53053\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the text. The user is asking people to join a mailing list. The reason given is in case \"the anti-vaxxers ever get the page taken down again.\" So, they're worried that anti-vaxxers might take down their page, and they want to keep people informed via a mailing list.\n\nNow, the mention of \"anti-vaxxers\" implies that the user is against them. Anti-vaxxers are people who oppose vaccination, so calling someone an anti-vaxxer generally has a negative connotation. The user is expressing concern that these anti-vaxxers might take action, hence the need for the mailing list as a precaution.\n\nBut the stance towards vaccination isn't directly about the vaccine itself. It's more about the opposition to those who are against vaccination. So, the user is taking a stance against anti-vaxxers, which indirectly supports vaccination. By opposing those who are against vaccines, the user is aligning themselves with pro-vaccine sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the link provided is for a mailing list. I'm not sure what the content of that list is, but the context suggests it's related to the page the user is trying to protect against being taken down. This reinforces the idea that the user supports vaccination and wants to keep people informed despite potential opposition.\n\nHowever, could there be any ambiguity? Maybe. If the user had only mentioned \"anti-vaxxers\" without any additional context, it might be less clear. But in this case, the intent is to prevent the page from being taken down, which means the original page likely supports vaccination. So, the user's action of creating a mailing list to safeguard this page indicates support for vaccination.\n\nIs there any possibility the user is neutral? Well, neutral would mean not having a strong opinion for or against. But the use of \"anti-vaxxers\" and the worry about their actions suggests the user is taking a side, specifically against those who are anti-vax. Therefore, it's more than neutral; it's taking a stand against anti-vaxxers, which implies a pro-vaccine stance.\n\nIn summary, the user's action and wording indicate support for vaccination by opposing those who are against it. So, the stance is PRO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "292": "Okay, so I need to figure out the user's stance towards vaccination based on the given Facebook text. The text is: \"I’m holding a leprosy party next week. Anyone up for a dose of Natural Immunity? I can guarantee no soap and water in case anyone wants to cheat.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the message. The user is planning a \"leprosy party,\" which immediately raises a red flag because leprosy is a serious infectious disease. Leprosy is treated with antibiotics, and vaccination against it exists, though it's less common in many regions. However, the mention of \"Natural Immunity\" suggests that the user supports the idea of getting immunity through exposure rather than vaccination.\n\nThe phrase \"dose of Natural Immunity\" is key here. It implies that the user believes getting the disease naturally is preferable to getting vaccinated. Natural immunity is the immunity one gets after being infected, as opposed to vaccination, which provides protection without the risks of the disease.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentions \"no soap and water\" and a \"cheat,\" which implies that they are encouraging unsafe practices that could spread the disease. Good hygiene, like handwashing, is a basic preventive measure against many infections. By ensuring no soap and water, the user is actively promoting an environment that facilitates the spread of the disease, which further indicates a negative view of preventive measures like vaccination.\n\nPutting this together, the user is advocating for exposure to a disease to gain natural immunity rather than relying on vaccines. This stance is clearly against vaccination because they are promoting a method that is both dangerous and not as effective as vaccination, which is a well-established, safe, and effective public health measure.\n\nTherefore, the stance here is ANTI because the user is endorsing an approach that opposes vaccination in favor of deliberately exposing oneself to disease for natural immunity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"ANTI\"\n}\n```",
    "293": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the user's stance on vaccination based on the Facebook text they provided. The user gave the text: \"MMR states s/e thrombocytopenia.\" I need to determine if this is a PRO, ANTI, or NON stance towards vaccination.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text. \"MMR\" usually stands for the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine. \"States s/e\" is a bit unclear; maybe it's a typo or abbreviation. \"s/e\" could stand for \"side effect.\" So, putting it together, the text might be saying that the MMR vaccine states a side effect of thrombocytopenia.\n\nThrombocytopenia is a condition where you have a low number of platelets in your blood, which can lead to easy bruising or bleeding. It's a known side effect of the MMR vaccine, albeit rare. So the user is pointing out that the MMR vaccine has this particular side effect.\n\nNow, considering the user's stance. If they're mentioning a side effect, it doesn't inherently mean they're against the vaccine. They could be informing others, discussing potential risks, or expressing concern. However, without additional context, it's challenging to gauge their sentiment. Are they just stating a fact, or are they implying that this side effect is a reason to avoid the vaccine?\n\nSince the text is primarily factual and doesn't express a clear positive or negative opinion, it leans towards neutral. The user isn't advocating for or against vaccination; they're highlighting a specific side effect. Therefore, the stance is likely neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "294": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out the stance the user has towards vaccination in this Facebook text. The text says, \"That's horrible, and nearly entirely preventable.\" So, first, I need to break this down. \n\nThe word \"horrible\" clearly expresses a negative sentiment about something. But the key here isn't the sentiment of the text but the stance towards vaccination. The phrase \"nearly entirely preventable\" seems to suggest that whatever is being referred to can be prevented. Since the user is talking about prevention, I'm thinking that vaccination might be the method they're referring to. \n\nVaccines are known to prevent diseases, so if a situation is preventable, it could be due to vaccination. Therefore, even though the general sentiment is negative about the situation, the user is indicating a positive stance towards vaccination. \n\nI should make sure I'm not conflating the overall sentiment with the stance on vaccination. The user is upset about something that could have been avoided, which likely points to vaccination as the solution. So, the stance is positive.\n</think>\n\nThe stance is positive as the preventable nature suggests support for vaccination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"PRO\"\n}\n```",
    "295": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance the user has towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The instruction is to look at their specific stance, not the general sentiment. That means if the text is negative overall, but they still support vaccination, I should mark it as PRO, and vice versa.\n\nLooking at the text, the user wrote: \"Foolproof way of going on a sweet all expenses paid holiday to the Maldives!\" \n\nHmm, this doesn't seem to mention anything related to vaccines. The focus is on a holiday or vacation. So, there's no positive, negative, or neutral mention about vaccination here. The user is just talking about going on a holiday.\n\nSince the question is about the vaccination stance, and the text doesn't address that at all, the correct stance would be neutral. There's no indication of support or opposition towards vaccines. Therefore, the answer should be NON.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The text is entirely about a holiday, no medical terms or references to health policies. Yeah, definitely not related. So, the stance is neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "296": "Okay, so I need to figure out the stance the user has towards vaccination based on their Facebook text.

They were skeptical about a statement saying 100% of Australia was vaccinated against smallpox and checked the stats, finding it was actually around 97% in England and that Australia had a strong anti-vaccine lobby too. They reference a study to conclude not everyone was vaccinated.\n\nSo, despite calling out misinformation and noting that not everyone was vaccinated, the user isn't explicitly supporting or opposing vaccination. They're more focused on correcting the statistic and the misinformation aspect. There's no strong pro or anti statement, just a correction of data and a neutral stance on misinformation in general.\n\nSo the stance here is likely Neutral, which is 'NON'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "297": "Alright, the user wants to determine the stance towards vaccination based on a given text, ignoring the overall sentiment. The stance options are NON (neutral), ANTI (negative), or PRO (positive). \n\nLooking at the text, \"So, how does one view the comments on the petition, if one is using the evil iOS app for book of faces?\" the user is questioning how to evaluate comments on a petition, possibly related to vaccination, but it's unclear. They also mention that their writing has been affected by the Spudd article, which likely contains sarcastic or satirical content. \n\nThe text doesn't explicitly mention vaccination or express a clear stance. It's more about the method of viewing comments rather than the stance on vaccination. Therefore, the user's stance remains neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stance\": \"NON\"\n}\n```",
    "298": "Alright, let me try to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a query where they need to determine the stance of a user towards vaccination based on a given Facebook text. The stance should be one of three options: NON (neutral), ANTI (negative), or PRO (positive). \n\nFirst, I recall that the user's instructions were to analyze the text regardless of the general sentiment. So even if the overall sentiment is negative, the stance towards vaccination could be positive, and vice versa.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the text says, \"They are truly delusional.\" I need to figure out the stance towards vaccination from this statement. The key is to analyze the specific words and their context regarding vaccination.\n\nThe word \"delusional\" typically means someone who holds beliefs that are not based on reality or logic. In the context of vaccination, if the user refers to others as delusional, it implies that those others are not thinking clearly about vaccination. So, the user might be suggesting that vaccination is the rational choice, hence a positive stance. \n\nAlternatively, if the user was anti-vaccination, they might refer to vaccine supporters as delusional. However, without explicit mention of vaccination in the example, it's a bit challenging. But given the problem statement, we have to infer based on the text provided.\n\nIn this case, the example's response was \"PRO.\" That suggests that the system inferred a positive stance towards vaccination because the text was critical of those opposing it. \n\nSo, when analyzing future texts, I need to look for language that either supports or opposes vaccination, regardless of the surrounding sentiment. Words like \"delusional\" could indicate a negative view of anti-vaccination sentiment, thus implying a positive stance on vaccination itself.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the stance being neutral if the text neither supports nor opposes vaccination. However, in this example, the response was \"PRO,\" showing that the system recognizes the criticism of anti-vaccination as a positive stance.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, it's crucial to dissect each word and its implications carefully, especially when the stance isn't explicitly stated but inferred through nuances in language.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"stance\": \"PRO\"}\n```",
    "299": "Okay, let's see here. I have this task where I need to determine the stance of a user towards vaccination based on their Facebook text. The user could be expressing a positive, negative, or neutral stance, regardless of the overall sentiment of the text. So, even if the text has a negative general sentiment, it might reflect a positive stance towards vaccination, and vice versa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's message, \"Oh my god that is disgusting. What a nob.\" It seems like the user is expressing strong negative emotions. \"Disgusting\" and \"What a nob\" are both phrases that convey dislike or disapproval.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if this negative sentiment translates to a negative stance towards vaccination or if it's about something else. Without more context, it's a bit challenging. Maybe \"disgusting\" refers to something related to vaccination, or maybe it's about someone who is against vaccination.\n\nI guess I have to consider both possibilities. If the user is reacting negatively to something related to vaccination, it could mean they have a negative stance towards it. Alternatively, if they're expressing frustration towards someone who is against vaccination, it could mean they have a positive stance towards vaccination.\n\nConsidering the lack of context, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the phrasing. \"Oh my god that is disgusting. What a nob.\" Using \"disgusting\" is a strong negative word, which might indicate disapproval towards something. If that something is vaccination, then the stance could be negative.\n\nHowever, without clear context, it's hard to be certain. If \"What a nob\" is directed at someone who is against vaccination, maybe the user actually supports vaccination but is frustrated by someone's stance.\n\nOverall, the negative language might suggest a negative stance towards vaccination, but there's also a possibility of the stance being neutral or positive despite the negative words. Given that, I should probably default to the most likely interpretation based on the words used.\n</think>\n\nThe user's negative language suggests a negative stance towards vaccination."
